ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'a huge room with king bed , luxurious bathroom , and a great location .the breakfast was included and was excellent , as was the service .if you play golf make sure you stay long enough to play on the oubaai course - it \'s outstanding . </DOC> this is truly great value for money top class hotel .it is a 15 minutes drive from george , the airport and fancourt , and is a perfect launch pad for trips around the garden route .the rooms include great facilities , are modern and very large by international standards .the bath rooms are unique and the roof shower most enjoyable .we were a large group of cyclist and the hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful to look after all our needs and special meal requirements .the hotel has some of the very best views of the mountains , and we enjoyed breakfasts overlooking the greater george area .we did have perfect blue sky \'s </DOC> my first visit this side of a south africa and this was my base for two days as i took part in the knysna forest marathon .the hotel is so nice and quiet such that on my check in i asked where was everybody .the hotel is in on a golf estatethe rooms are splendid and well kept , the grounds spotless and the staff very courteous .i would definitely stay a little while longer next time and perhaps begin work on my biography as the hotel is the perfect place for some peace and quiet time . </DOC> the staff could not have been more helpful or welcoming .the room was large with a comfortable bed and good shower .unfortunately the two restaurants we went to were not very good .i suspect there is not enough turnover for them to offer a huge selection although the quality was reasonable .the restaurant offering the buffet supper was cavernous with absolutely no atmosphere .the a la carte restaurant had better decor but was still rather flat .the hotel gives you access to a wonderful golf course </DOC> a 5 star experience , except for the really hard bed .we opted for the " game drive " package on the hotel \'s website : room , breakfast and game drive for two .the staff was very friendly and helpful with our tour planning .the resort is reasonably close to the george airport , and located out in picturesque countryside overlooking the indian ocean in the distance .the restaurant is excellent , and we enjoyed a fine dinner and a good breakfast buffet ( anyway , no other food option is close ) .the included afternoon game drive to the nearby ( 30 min . )botlierskop private game reserve was an exciting introduction to our nature experience in south africa . viewing the wide range of animals up close on this moderate sized park was awesome .be prepared for a rough ride on hilly roads .overall , an outstanding experience . </DOC> stayed for two nights in the middle of the world cup en - route from cape town to pe . absolutely great across the board . </DOC> the hotel is very nicely located , nestled between green hills of the golf - court and the coast .the surroundings are absolutely stunning .this time we booked two nights in a club room , on the third floor of the main building .this , honestly , was a huge disappointment and not worth the extra money .when we entered the club lounge around 5.30 pm , the bottles of wine that were placed on the buffet were almost empty and there was hardly any food left .only shortly before 7 pm a staff member came by to restock the bar/ clean - up .besides the snacks and drinks one would expect coffee / tea and mineral water being offered during the whole day . </DOC> this establishment is well located .an approximate 15 minute drive from the airport and right by the sea .the staff were friendly and very helpful .the rooms are spacious , well appointed and excellently decorated .the hotel area is peaceful and allows for a good rest .the bed was comfortable and as a result i had a good night \'s sleep .the breakfast was delicious .the golf cart for ferrying guests around the hotel complex is a good addition .i give the hotel 7.8 out of 10 .'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"very nice hotel in recoleta , a rich neighborhood ( mix of tourists and locals ) in the buenos aires .recoleta cemetery ( with a few restaurants close by ) is only 2 streets away ago .recoleta is in the center of buenos airesbut there \xe2\x80\x99s no subte ( subway ) in recoletaso you have to walk a bit to get to it .breakfast was good and the room was clean ( although a bit small ) .staff was nice , except maybe at night .hotel was very good for the price paid . </DOC> a really good hotel .i recommend you chose a callao suite which is like a mini appartment .great location , very nice hotel .the staff is attentive and good breakfast too .i would recommend this hotel for first time travellers to baires </DOC> we stayed here for a few nights while visiting buenos aires after patagonia .the hotel was located within good walking distance to the cemetery , downtown , restaurants and more .we were able to walk everywhere .there was free internet in the business area and breakfast was nice with a variety of things to choose from .the people at the desk were helpful and the hotel was very clean and comfortable .the rooms were large and quiet . </DOC> it is nothing special despite the ambition to be 4* but comfortable and with an expensive but very good italian restaurant on the ground floor .breakfast is reasonable with furit , eggs and many types of pastriesbut if you check out early they do not provide even coffee which is poor service .there are other restaurants nearby according to budget - the one next to the beaux art museum is very good .nb to see buenos aires use the open top tour bus sometimes called the yellow bus .the agents are very reluctant to give details as they want to sell live tours and object to the use of audio tapes on the bus .it is hop on hop off .one stop is quite near the hotel by the recoleta cemetery - also a must - see ! </DOC> this hotel is a rare find : one that lives up to its own description .the rooms are quiet , comfortable and roomy and equipped with an amazing array of powerpoints to charge up all your various devices .the staff is very helpful and also very unobtrusive .it is perfectly located in an elegant district and the italian restaurant is first - class . strongly recommended . </DOC> friendly staff at this conveniently located hotel .rooms were clean .breakfast was good and was included .excellent but expensive restaurant for dinner , seems to be popular with the locals , reservations are recommended .no swimming pool . excellent massage .good hotel close to the cruise terminal and national airport for flights to iguassu falls . </DOC> stayed in this very nice hotel on our last night .the room was spacious with a very good bathroom- pity the water was only tepid forcing very quick showers .staff were friendly and welcoming .it did have that city hotel soulless feel to it . dined in the restaurant for convenience , it was a little formal which was inconvenient as we were left with few clothing choices at this point and felt underdressed .the menu is a bit quirky in that the dishes are priced for two sharing , the food was good and the service excellent .it seemed that the diners were regular locals which is always a good sign .breakfast was extensive a tasty , but most of the people seemed to be business travelers so it was a less relaxed atmosphere . </DOC> the hotel is located in the heart of recoleta .the room is nice and well decorated but the bathroom is too small .the hotel is only 2 blocks away from recoleta cemetery and recoleta mall .there are many nice restaurants and shopping places in the area .this is a really beautiful area and we feel very safe walking around even at night time .the breakfast was great even not a big selection but the quality was good .the staff were just ok .they are not particularly friendly or helpfuland that 's the best they can do"

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"we drove through il calafate last night to this hotel just 10 minutes walk from the town .it consists of various ' houses ' each containing a number of individual rooms ( ours was quite a walk from the main building ) which are set in lovely almost japanese - style gardens with some interesting ibis - like birds who seem to be resident here .the rooms ( we had a suite ) are extremely spacious and ours had two double beds .the bathroom had all we needed with a bath and overhead shower combined , bidet and nice bath products .comfortable beds and lovely monogrammed towels which we thought was a nice touch .there are two restaurants in the hotel .one is called the club house and has a little bar .it was good but not exceptionalbut i would certainly recommend it . </DOC> this beautiful hotel is really a series of buildings scattered around a beautifully landscaped property that backs upyo the family home of chtistina kirchner , the pres . of argentina .grounds had willow trees everywhere ( los sauces ) , gravel walks , quaint bridge over a stream .you are taken from check in to your building via golf cart .we were in a bldg in back across from restaurant ... an upstairs suite .hotel is right in the middle of town an ez walk to all .building with suite : entry level had large beautifully decorated .sitting area- leather over stuffed sofas , hard wood coffee tables , photo books on patagonia , horses , etc .; decorating wad very tasteful argentinian : / spanish .small deck overlooking gardens , small dining table , antique cabinet .bedroom was huge .all gorgeous design . </DOC> an interesting hotel within easy walking distance of main street .rooms are spread over the extensive grounds in groups with common lounges .but we found it quite easy to walk between the different areas through interesting grounds .breakfast was very good although at the opposite end of the resort to our room we could have ordered a buggy but found walking was a good start to the day .had 2 meals in the restaurant and found them very good . </DOC> we made use of the golf buggies to get around , and the breakfasts were excellent .the staff were also very helpful in giving us a slightly later check out to fit in with our flight .very convenient location to walk to the local restaurants , and staff very happy to make reservations for us . </DOC> we stayed for three days and were very fortunate to have a large room in lodge 5 with open views of the lake .staff were always unobtrusively efficient , buggies seemed to just arrive whenever needed , breakfast buffet items replenished constantly and a turn down service that really is in the evening , not in the afternoon .the bathrooms are very well equipped and with the best shower pressure in argentina .a class act . </DOC> the rooms are very comfortable , the service was great and the food was very good .it was a short stay but very enjoyable .i highly recommend the dining right off the guest registration area .we had a delicious meal there , hake fish , butternut squash soup and vegetable roll .service was perfect . </DOC> a very homely hotel with a lovely restaurant and great staff .the spa facilities look great although i did n't use them .the rooms were big and well presented .the only downside to this hotel is that it does not have views of the lake or mountains however there is plently of time to see these wonders on the numerous tours available .the town is very quaint and is about a 10min walk from the hotel </DOC> this hotel is set out as a series of lodges , each containing a number of rooms , in beautiful gardens and grounds .the rooms are very large , and we found them to be clean and comfortable .although very hot , so we had to open some windows at night .the restaurants are at the front and very rear , a couple of hundred meters apart . to walk to and from there are only loose gravel roads , difficult to walk on at times .poor lighting along the roadways and watch out for golf carts .there are no footpaths or area to get easily off the road without stepping over rails onto the gardens or grass .there is a considerable surcharge for room service .but overall a beautiful oasis ."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"the pictures of the updates look like a great addition to a lovely property .staff was helpful as alwaysstay in the ocatilla area , if you can . </DOC> this is a lovely resort with beautiful grounds .the place oozes of history & a very rich heritage as the grande dame of arizona .no one can take that away from this property .the bathrooms are quite smallbut the room was over 500 sq ft . & very elegant .but really ? a keurig ?i also found the amenities in the bathroom to be quite limited .yes , they have the brands signature ferragamo line . </DOC> from the room itself( i had my own patio ) to the fitness center , i wish i had more time to explore the property and simply hang out and relax .i was here for a work function and was enamored by the beautiful grounds and landscape .my team was also able to witness the lighting of the christmas tree on the front lawn , complete with snow and santa .minor complaints would include not having a coffee maker in the room but there was a cafe close by where i could easily purchase one .another small issue was one of the toilet roll holders was off the stall wall and on the floor in one of the bathroom stalls in the women 's bathroom by the conference rooms .i thought that these bathrooms could have been a little better kept . </DOC> stayed here three nights for work and stayed in the ocotillo area of the resort .rooms are larger than average for the area .ocotillo area has light breakfast , afternoon snacks , and desserts at night .i had help from carlton at the front desk who fixed a parking issue for me .decorated for the holidays . </DOC> spectacular vintage property that is well maintained .the hotel has lots of buildings and you may have to walk for a few minutes .not a big deal .the restaurants and bars were full of action and open .the chilled pools were great to take a dip in at night and are open 24 hours .my room in the valley view building was huge , had great air conditioning and a loaded mini bar .you need to call for ice and they deliver right away .the main bar had great wines by the glass and a special features wine .staff was great .the valet is much easier and the garage is about a 5 - 10 minute walk to rooms .they did have a golf cart shuttle running guests to rooms when i arrived .you can walk it .great deals on hilton mvp site for summer ! </DOC> pros : very nice hotel with a sprawling campus .the brunch was awesome and highly recommended .terrific service by the hotel staff which were very friendly .cons : the main pool had blaring music , almost like a club .the golf course is not part of the hotel .there was no service to take your golf bags1000 ' feet across the street .the staff did not know about the amenities of the golf course .you can walk or drive across the street to play one of the two courses which are very nice .i thought this hotel was going to be relaxing and a golf resort . </DOC> i was really impressed by sheer size of the property and also the fact that it was so close to the airport and in the city itself , once could easily walk to the shopping places nearby, it was like a totally different , plugged out of city experience .they have a huge choice of pools including a big water slide that seemed like a lot of fun .there was a decent set of restaurant options insidei must say the food was excellent , the salads were amazing and to my surprise the hotel had even organized indian food that was pretty awesome !i loved their fitness center - had some great cardio and strength equipment , i probably spent a lot more time here than i had planned for .the staff were very courteous and their service was superb !i would like to pass on my thanks to the wonderful staff who made the experience fantastic ! </DOC> i thought the property was very nice .well groomed and very pretty to look at .& i could not enjoy the property to the fullest .our meals were very well done with good food and even better service .the room was larger & very nice .very nice staff just not enough to handle the guests timely .frank & alberts was nice to eat at .ask for a room in the main building if you want to be close .the cottages looked nice but some are a long walk to the main building ."
