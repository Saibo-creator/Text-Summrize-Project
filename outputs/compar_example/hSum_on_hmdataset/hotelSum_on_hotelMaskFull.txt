ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'this was the finest hotels in bogota but is now starting to feel rather tired .it \'s rather sprawling and to get to breakfast is a long torturous walk that seemed to go on for ever .rooms are niceand i was upgradedbut i was surprised that there was n\'t even a free bottle of water for a spire member . </DOC> large hotel connected to a network of shops and eating places .overall hotel looks and feels dated .rooms are ok and clean but also dated .meals were average .coffee was very average .in summary an ok hotel that would need quite a bit of upgrade to bring it to the 21st century . </DOC> when i arrived late at night at this hotel i got a room where the garbage and some dirty coffee cups where left ( you never know what else .. ) .then they changed my room , but the internet was not working there-it took them half an hour to get the technician to my room and another hour to get the internet working ) .after midnight i could already check my emails !the prices they charge for business center services are out of this world ( 2 usd per page ! ! ! ) . </DOC> the hotel is ok , a little old .rooms are good , as the bathrooms .front desk was not perfect , took a lot of times , and since it is a big hotel , they simply don\xc2\xb4t know that you are a guest there .the problem is the area .is in the center of bogota and the surroundings are not very nice nor safe .it is better to stay close to the g , t zones .those areas are really beautiful . </DOC> this is a grande dame of bogota hotels .the rooms are spacious and have a great view of the downtown .breakfast is amazing , just the coffee sets you up for the whole day but a made to order omelet and wonderful selections of columbian specialties adds to the experience .security is very high and the staff is polite and efficient . </DOC> this is a good hotel , but a little tired in the lobby area and rooms .breakfast is included and very nice at the restaurant , and the food for lunch and dinner are excellent .it \'s downtownand you can not walk outside at night due to concerns about crime in the area , so only during the day can you explore downtown . </DOC> overall good service and an old fashioned hotel but with good amenities .the guarded hotel does make it feel very safe , although it \'s in a safe area anyway .the rooms are reasonable spacious some more than others .restaurant service and menu is good , and the breakfast does have an egg bar .overall a good place to stay . </DOC> this hotel is a good locationneither the safe nor the tv in my room worked .both were likely related to the system of the electricity turning off when you took your card out of the slot by the door and/or turned off the lights .but in this case all the electrical outlets would top functioning when you turned off the lights , or removed the card from the slot so you also could n\'t charge your phone or computer overnight while sleeping .the bar in the hotel had a big sign saying " sports / food / drink , " except that they do n\'t actually serve food .and most importantly , twice i asked for a new room key ( because i left one in the room slot so i could charge things ) and neither time did they ask for i d before giving it to me .'
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'this is a good hotel with really good rooms and the staff are polite and helpful. the hotel is in the middle of nowhere so a little noisy but as I was in the room I was disturbed by noise and traffic noise from neighbouring noise & shouting in the morning. Staff were friendly but not up to scratch</DOC>'

being a solo travellerthe resort is small enough that you get to meet the other guests , which is a nice welcome than the bigger resorts found elsewhere .while others have commented that the villas are too close , you do n\'t even notice them given their strategic placing .even had a friendly ghecko who kept me company at night !this was definitely a minor thing given your only a few steps from the beach . </DOC> big thanks to victoria , frederick and the superb team at the havannah !sparkling wine on ice in our pool - side villa[ all beach front were booked out - but we did nt care as what we had was perfect for us in the end ) , warm infinity pool at the doordinner under the stars on the sand by the nightly bonfire , motorboat ride for a picnic on the shores of moso island , breakfast served fast and hot in hearty portions by hearty smiles , snorkelling to the catamaran , climbing up and drifting off to sleep ...the list of things we did are probably endless .the worst part was visiting port vila for an hour or two ... taxi !take me back to havannah !job well done everyone . </DOC> very relaxing one week stay .beautiful grounds and villa .manager frederick very attentive and spoke each morning to all the guests and genuinely interested in any concerns .staff lovely and welcoming .it was a pleasure to sit each morning at breakfast , always excellent , and look out on the beautiful white sand beach .snorkeling not great but kayaks and catamaran available and even a friendly rescue when we capsized it !do n\'t hesitate to go if you want a totally relaxing stay in a well run resort .'
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'Threaded for the location of the resort is a five minute walk from the beach and a few restaurants. Staff very friendly and helpful with great facilities and restaurants , breakfast , pool , spa , good food , staff , housekeeping and staff are superb , thank you to all staff - and all staff were great , thank you to all staff who were so helpful & friendly .

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"made a special effort to come here for dinner - and was n't disappointed .designer food fit for the cream of the diplomatic crowd .the colonial - style building has a wonderful waterside setting which made it fun watching the bats dining on the mossies before we tucked into something far more appetising .though the grub was , the best part of th evening was spent in the bar where the delightful hay mun mixed us her award - winning kaffir kolada cocktails .worth going just to see her smile . </DOC> top hotel - not huge but pleasant rooms ( bathrooms could be updated a bit ) , very attentive staff , nice pool and lovely veranda eating ( you can also ahve a table on the lawn ) .food was wonderful and its quiet location meant it was a great refuge from downtown rangoon .definitely a much better place to stay than the strand whihc looked lovely but surronded by noisy down town roads . </DOC> this is a lovely hotel in a plush garden setting in the diplomatic area of yangon .and we absolutely loved the upstairs myanmar style restaurant upstairs .rooms are as you expect in a hotel of this caliber .not cheap , however you get what you pay for .commercial downtown area is only a short and inexpensive taxi ride away .i had the opportunity to visit the strand hotel in downtown yangon and whilst a grand impressive hotel , staying at the governorsfelt like an oasis .certainly recommended for those beginning or starting a trip in myanmar or doing local business . </DOC> high quality , good food , great service and friendly staff .after a long flight from europe was just the place to arrive and feel relaxed .only downside is that location is a bit quiet and far from things but overall would really recommend </DOC> the hotel layout in a garden in authentic colonial building blocks is excellent .. the rooms are large , well appointed , greta bathing areas .. the common areas are breathtaking .. large first floor verandah ..excellent burmese curries buffet ..great service .. the breakfast area could n't be better .. overlooking a lotus pond .. as good as an authentic colonial hotel can be .. </DOC> our room was very dark ( with all the lights on ! ) and noisy - just walking around the room on the wooden floorboards sounded like a herd of elephants and for the price we were paying i expected a bath in the bathroom not just a shower .breakfast both days was good , but after dinner the first night we would n't dine there again .the chef is mexican so a burmese - mexican limited menu is available .we were woken both mornings at 4.30am by loud music from the property next door and people leaving for early flights the second morning .the grounds are very nicebut it does n't make up for the hotels shortcomings .we had another 3 nights in yangon at the end of our trip and stayed at the chatrium on the executive floor for cheaper than 2 nights here . </DOC> although the hotel is in a good part of town , and the setting lovelyit was the poorest orient express hotel that we stayed at .although the rooms were large we found them very dark and it rook ages to fill the bath .the staff were charming but hopeless , they need to learn how to serve you .it took ages to get anything at all and when we asked for a high tea were told we have to order it a day in advance .dinner was in a very nice setting but the service was so slow .this hotel needs a good manager to shake it upand then it will be excellent ,how about the one from luang prabang , he is amazing </DOC> very comfortable hoteal and staff were superb .however a dead mouse in the public toilets was a bit of a downer ."
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b"Overall a good stay at the Royal Palace Hotel in the heart of the city. Staff are very welcoming and friendly and rooms good size and clean with good facilities, good bar food & wine list! Rooms need a bit more TLC but overall it's a good hotel with good service & staff</DOC>"

ORIGINAL REVIEW:  b'we stayed at the strand on the way into yangon , and the governors residence on the way out .wish we had done the reverse because it was 2 nights at strand , and only 1 at the gr .the gr also has lush gardens and is much more scenic .the room was not as large as the strand , but was a very decent size .overall , my recommendation between the 2 would be the gr , even tho the breakfast ( which was alacarte ) was better at the strand .also closer to the airport so less travel time in a crowded city .</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"we stayed at the strand on the way into yangon , and the governors residence on the way out .wish we had done the reverse because it was 2 nights at strand , and only 1 at the gr .the gr also has lush gardens and is much more scenic .the room was not as large as the strand , but was a very decent size .overall , my recommendation between the 2 would be the gr , even tho the breakfast ( which was alacarte ) was better at the strand .also closer to the airport so less travel time in a crowded city . </DOC> and it was by far the best hotel we stayed inand i ' m guessing the best in myanmar .it is just so relaxing to turn into the driveway at the end of a day of shopping or touring and just immediately relax .the service in the hotel was excellent and the breakfasts were absolutely delicious - loved the signature omelette .i would definitely stay here againand i ' m sorry that our stay was n't longer . </DOC> siam bangkok , trisara phuket , howies home stay chiang mai , and 137 pillar house chiang mai .stayed at this hotel for two days before departing for mandalay .surprisingly good hotel considering how new luxury tourism is in myanmar .the staff was professional and helpful .they have an excellent selection of cuban and dominican cigars .the breakfast is great .the service is professional and friendly .we have a beautiful governors suite with a patio looking over a lilly pond .if you are staying in yangon i would highly recommend this hotel . </DOC> the place is very luxurious and clean .service is friendly and attentive .our rooms were comfortable and were equipped with all the necessary amenities and a mosquito net covering the bed .the breakfast is very tasty and there is plenty of food with a local touch .staff were very helpful arranging a smooth and convenient stay .i do recommend booking a table at the ( ground floor ) restaurant instead of the buffet on the first floor as the restaurant is more romantic and the food is better . </DOC> the governor 's residence is a little out of the way but it is a beautiful hotel with an excellent staff and a very good hotel . </DOC> i travelled in myanmar and stayed on my own in yangon for 5 nights of gentle sightseeing before joining road to mandalay .i selected the governors residence as it was in the burbs , had a garden and pool and 2 restaurants .i had in mind that i could sightsee and then relax in lovely surroundings and be able to eat on my own with a view of the garden etc , rather than with my nose in a book or stuck with room service .this was the perfect choice .staying here was a real treat from the moment i arrived .my room was fantastic , on the ground floor settled in the grounds , i was very comfortable . </DOC> we definitely saved the best for last and was pleased that we did things in this order .certainly the most luxurious place that we stayed in or so in myanmar .not cheap but what do you expect .value for money ?we thought so , but everyone has a different take on value propositions . </DOC> staff and great colonial / burmese atmosphere but with everything you would find in a 6 star hotel .each day there would be a free activity for guests e.g. , tour of local art galleries a tour of , chinatown , cocktail party to minge with executive staff and fellow guests .everything you could think of was available at the breakfast buffet plus an egg / pancake station with individual cooking .the hotel is situated in the diplomatic quieter part of town with gardens and a large pool .we were grateful we were away from the hustle and bustle and traffic jams of down town yangon ."

SUMMARY:  b'I travelled with the family of 5 in the past two years and it is a great hotel and value for money , the staff were helpful , food was ok , the evening meal was good , service very good . Room was well appointed . Staff friendly and helpful . Staff friendly</DOC>'

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'Ive booked a room for 2 nights with family and friends and the hotel is in the old town. the staff were very helpful and friendly. Lovely bar with good food and decent buffet breakfast - good choice of food, good value but not very good value and no negatives: - rooms are small , but clean & comfortable but I would not recommend it for travellers</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'i \' ve stayed in this hotel for 4 nights for my business trip .hotel is not centrally located , but close to gangnam district , and shopping malls .metro stop is really close .room is spacious , clean and modern , with a special toilet (the breakfast is just amazing ( especially kiwi dressing ) .huge choice and great food .staff is very friendly and helpful .in general , very good hotel to stay for few days .for sure for business trip ! </DOC> the rooms were comfortable , clean and functional .the bed was very comfortable , with nice beddingand i enjoyed a really good nights sleep .the room was adequately furnished with excellent toiletries .the hotel restaurant was good with a decent spread of food at breakfast , however , the restaurant food at dinner , including room service was fairly expensive .the quality of food provided in the restaurant was of a high standard and good quality .the location of the hotel is good , although it is not located in the downtown tourist area , a nearby walk takes you to lots of small street restaurants , as well as a large shopping mall " shinshaegae".the staff were very courteous and helpful , with a good command of english .i would recommend this hotel , just note it is a 10 minute taxi drive to city hall . </DOC> although quite compact , the rooms here have everything i you need , and are clean and comfortable .the area is quite lively , the staff are friendly , and i was able to easily call taxis here .i was only here for one night , but could easily spend longer . </DOC> fantastic in all regards .i think the dinner buffet was the best i have seen in a hotel , countless options , far too many for me to have even a little of everything .the dessert menu is incredible .the rooms are very well appointed and modern .the location is tops , right in the centre of the city and the action .the 10th floor room deal is da bom ;all you can eat and drink at breakfast and dinner ! ! ! </DOC> the location is pretty near the express bus terminal and big underground shopping mall .nearby many restaurants and hotel is big with quite some facilities .supposedly they upgraded me but the room has no sofa or work desk .instead it has a long counter and some high chairs .the toilet is small and odd shape , walking into shower is not so convenient .also no bath tub .but what irritate me is , not only it has no power source near the bed, the whole room only has 1 plug !and it \'s far side at the counter .it \'s funny why they can add more power source .check in and out is a breeze .overall a good hotel but careful on the room type given . </DOC> the service is fine but the rooms are small .the hotel style is old fashion and older .also , the internet at least when i was staying there was difficult to login , slow and unreliable .the best part of the hotel is that it is located a short walking distance from restaurants and stores .the hotel is nearby apartments and but away from the center of the business district .it appears that the hotel is a common spot for weddings in korea . </DOC> visit to the sheraton seoul palace gangnam was filled with disappointment at check in and never improved .at check in , was reluctant to recognize my membership number .once recognize my status , was quick to advise no changes available for today and to check back in tomorrow .had to request lounge access which is a normal perk .lounge questioned my status each time and provided dirty looks given the room number was not typical visitor .after 3 days , you would think they would remember .hotel is very dark , rooms a bit dated for what you expect in korea .i would recommend exploring other options unless need to stay in the area .there is a marriott across the street . </DOC> clean ( but rather small ) rooms .very good breakfast , both korean and western food available . friendly staff .internet in the rooms is good but not for free ( approx .the neighborhood behind the hotel has plenty of nice restaurants and bars to eat and/or have a drink ( or just to have a walk ) .the hotel is close to the bus station .you can take the korean airline limousine ( which is a bus ) service from the airport ; the first stop is the seoul palace hotel ( approx .one hour from the airport to the hotel ) .'
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'the hotel is a bit dated but the rooms are spacious . the staff were friendly and helpful ,,service was good . price was good with very good quality . I prefer to eat at this hotel and my room was clean . Bar staff friendly and helpful . Service good . i\xe2\x80\x99ll be back .</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"the location is excellent , with great access to food , shopping and entertainment .service is warm and definitely great value . </DOC> we found both of these 17th - floor accommodations to be immaculate and quiet with comfortable beds .though small , with tiny bathrooms , the rooms proved to be quite adequate for our needs .the rooms received little natural illumination , but we were rarely there during the day . </DOC> my friend who is used to four or five star hotels liked ibis myeongdong too .ibis management and staff do go the extra mile , rerouting the airport bus to stop at its doorsteps helps tremendously , plus an a+ location on the fringe of seoul shopping central .clean room , comfy bed , a good blast from the shower , service oriented staff , diligent housekeeping- basics for a good stay were all checked .now , for the extras that ibis provide that the expensive lotte hotel and westin chosun on the opposite side of the road do not - free wifi in room and scheduled guest shuttle services to popular tourist hotspots like itaewon and insadong . </DOC> this is the most difficult review of our recent trip to japan and korea .the reason is that we were happyoverall had a good price for the room -but there where many things that irritated .i ) location is great - in the middle of the action and an airport bus stop in front of the door .ii ) room was large with a practical set - upand we had a great view from the room ( 14th floor ), bed was not comfortable .ii ) service hit and miss .check in was very smooth and pleasant with good service - when we where at the reception later in our stay for some additional information however it was very chaotic and staff were quite rude </DOC> very convenient , airport bus just stop in front of the hotel .only 100 m go to the popular myeongdong shopping area .across the road , it 's lotte department store .everyone goes crazy in the duty free shop there .check in and out are fast .staff are helpful .room is clean but a bit small .this ibis is more expensive than other ibis hotels in seoul .i think it 's due to the prime location . </DOC> definitely the hotel of my first choice whenever i am in seoul .perfectly located for business as well as the myeongdong area with its shopping and various restaurants and night life .rooms are basic in the ibis stlye but all apsects are covered .the early riser breakfast is quite unique .the staff is very hospitable in true korean style .will be back again . </DOC> it 's the worst of all the accor group .the only redeeming factor is the location .it 's more expensive than any similar class hotel in the myeongdong area even though i booked using my advantage plus gold card .the rooms are small compared to skypark central .i used my card for breakfast only to be told the discount is a measly 10 % .the worse of all is that they offered a cheaper rate for breakfast if i had bought breakfast voucher a day in advance .staying in this hotel basically rendered my card useless .all the duty manager could say wasit 's their policy .this is my first and last time staying in this hoteland i will not recommend it to anyone .my advantage plus card really counts for nought . </DOC> very centrally located in myeong - dong , convenient to subway , shopping and dining .the hotel was clean and the staff very courteous .the hotel 's restaurant is very nice with a terrific european - style breakfast buffet that includes local and asian dishes as well ."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"the hotel has a superb location next to river nile .it also has abundant facilities .however , the service is not great , not great at all , for a grand hyatt in particular .one would also experience heavy traffic jam right outside the hotel because of the cramp hotel entrance , especially on thursday night during which the egyptians would likely hold wedding party there . </DOC> very good breakfast buffet with an incredible view of the nile .my room was on the 26th floor and the view of the nile , especially at sunrise and sunset , was incredible .the staff was very helpful . </DOC> we have stayed at various grand hyatts around the world , including recently oman and jakarta .this one in cairo does nt match them in terms of quality of service or installation .the service is rather indifferent to poor .the facilities are in need of maintenance and upgrading , eg the pool - a great size and view but needs to be remodelled and throughly cleaned - my child was playing with the tiles that had come off the bottom of the kiddies pool .we paid $ 250 per night plus 21 % tax which i did nt think was good value - this is egypt .having said that none of the international hotels get consistently good reviews .the location is great - very convenient for sight seeing and great views of the nile .the restaurants in the hotel are nothing special .i would recommend this with caution - do nt expect too much ! </DOC> compared to the general chaos in cairo , the hotel and the restaurants were superb .however , the service at both the hotel itself and in its restaurants lacked some small finesses i would have expected in a 5 star hotel .we booked the airport transfers from hyatt econcierge before going there .they could n't tell the prices on the web , but on arrival the transportation itself ( with a new mercedes c200 ) for 2 persons cost 85 usd .it included the meet & assist service with a guy waiting for us before the immigration .he helped us buying the visason departure , the transfer cost 50 usd . </DOC> this hotel has one of the best views in cairo , it was once grand hyatt till ownership changed and the new owner decided to make it a dry hotel due to less occupancy and the type of residents and the closed bar and other activities , this hotel lacks life and spirit .the first day i arrivedit was like a deserted hotel furniture looks old , rugs are dirty and needs replacement apart from the magnificent view , the staff is excellent and willing to help </DOC> this is a huge hotel complex on the nile .everything was adequate : the room , the food , the scene , etc . just nothing memorable or distinctive . perfectly comfortable , but uninspired . </DOC> rooms are not so big but luxurious nevertheless with great amenities and new furniture .staff in the hotel are generally helpful and the breakfast is exquisite .one of my best experiences in cairo- will come back for sure . </DOC> the grand hyatt is a convenient base with great facilities in downtown cairo .after a significant flight delay that caused us to arrive at the hotel at 4:45am , the staff did not miss a beat in helping with luggage and checking us in .the hotel has two levels of security .first , vehicles have to pass through a security gate .secondly , at the grand hyatt entrance , all bags ( large and small ) are scanned .\xe2\x80\x9d note that this complex has both a hyatt and grand hyatt next to each other .our room ( # 1045 ) had a beautiful nile river view .there is a small balcony from which you can watch the river traffic go by \xe2\x80\x93 wonderful !the bathroom has a toilet , bidet , shower / tub combo with a glass partition , and a sink ."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"dear tripadvisor traveler , we just returned from the mara sopa lodge , in the masai mara .and i wrote to mara sopa , that i want to have a hot shower prior to the game drive .also the food was delicious and the staff at the reception was very friendly to us .( he is a maasai ) and also the food and beverage manager at the mara sopa lodge .he was very accomodating to us , very friendly and courties .we never had a problem at the lodge and can recommand it highly .also the game viewing was outstanding since we were there during the height of the migration . </DOC> we stayed for three nights in the mara sopa lodge with our children and thought it was very good .the staff was friendly and helpfull .the indian inspired diner was very nice and breakfast was excellent .the children enjoyed the pool and we had a great time . </DOC> we loved this lodge ,due to it 's great location in the park , and due to the friendly staff and relaxed setting .the individual rooms are huge , and well appointed , with a little balcony looking out over the gardens .the pool area is very nice and elvis the pool bartender was excellent and a real character .the food is great , the only downside is the huge amount of people in the hotel who all seem to descend on dinner at the same time .as a travel agent i would definitely recommend this resort for anyone visiting the masai mara . </DOC> the rooms were big , comfortable and clean .we could hear the hyena at night .it was a bit creepy , especially when we were walking back to the room after dinner .the room was a bit of a walk , but we did n't mind .the exercise was good , especially after a good meal .the selection of food was pretty good .special mention to charles who waited on us .he was so polite , warm & friendly .the staff who greeted us as we waked in to the dining room , were friendly , and made you feel welcome .they had a hyena feeding time at 2230hrs .....we waited and waited , no hyena 's .after a long wait , we saw a baby hyena .it shied away from the wild cats and mongoose who were feeding on the carcass .we had a great stay ! </DOC> the rooms are not particularly modern , but were large and well looked after , if a little dark .the food was very goodand i particularly liked the d\xc3\xa9cor in the restaurant .the hyena feeding is worth seeing if you can manage to stay up until 10 - make sure you get there a few mins early to get a good spot - there are good views from the areas either side of the main viewing platform ( elevated a good few feet above the feeding area ) .the shop near reception had some good postcards .the pool area is not very bigthere is a ' masai village ' in the hotel grounds , just below the swimming pool .this is blatantly not authentic but worth a look if you have 5 mins to waste and do n't mind being dragged round their masai market afterwards . </DOC> some of the rooms are a bit of hike to get to , but they are clean and comfortable and roomy and the security guards are there to escort you to your room at night - animals of the 4 legged kind may be around ! ! </DOC> this hotel is built on the side of a hill inside of the masai mara game reserve .location is the best feature of this hotel .the rooms are two to a small round building .because of how the building is divided one can hear everything from the other half of the building .the rooms and the baths are both good sized .the walk to the rooms can be long from some rooms and there are lots of steps ( but no lift ) at the hotel .the dining room is very large and the food was good .there is a small pool with a great view of the valley below plus a small pool bar .a good location to tour the masai mara from . </DOC> stayed 2 nights during masai mara safaris .wifi only available in public areas .dinner and breakfast were both buffet arrangements and both offered a perfectly adequate selection to cater for most tastes .road up to lodge was awful , probably worst road on whole trip to kenyaand we were on some awful roads .the rooms are very comfortable and equipped with mosquito nets .would recommend this lodge if going on a safari to the masai mara ."
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'Threading is a good location for the town of the area. Its a new property with the most welcoming staff and rooms that are very clean and tidy and the staff were excellent and the food was good with a good selection of hot & cold items . Buffet breakfast was very good but no fresh fruit , good quality and service . Would stay again</DOC>'

SUMMARY:  b'Love the hotel in the heart of the city , walking distance to everything , room and staff are very friendly . Our room was spacious , clean , quiet and comfortable . breakfast was ok , this is not a city centre with plenty of eating places but not a car but it does need to be closed. Will go back !</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEW:  b"we have been staying at this hotel many times in the past few years , they have renovated the whole hotel a year ago and the lobby was so nice with all the small life plants on the walls .the reason that we kept going back to stay at this hotel is because it 's the convenience to get around in town .only about few minutes walk to the mtr station in yau ma tai and close by with tons of restaurants which you can select from for your meals .feet with a bathtub and a overhead shower head .i was very disappointed with the new bathtub in the room because it looks big butat the bottom of the tub the area where you can stand to take shower was so limited .</DOC>"

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"we have been staying at this hotel many times in the past few years , they have renovated the whole hotel a year ago and the lobby was so nice with all the small life plants on the walls .the reason that we kept going back to stay at this hotel is because it 's the convenience to get around in town .only about few minutes walk to the mtr station in yau ma tai and close by with tons of restaurants which you can select from for your meals .feet with a bathtub and a overhead shower head .i was very disappointed with the new bathtub in the room because it looks big butat the bottom of the tub the area where you can stand to take shower was so limited . </DOC> luckily for us the staff at the desk took pity on usthe staff were all very helpful and went out of their way to be of service .it was so nice to have such great customer service .it 's convenience as many have mentioned is perfect .and at the end of the road there is a pink sign on the corner to point you to the ladies market which is where we went to in the evening until it started to rain heavily .in the afternoon we bought a day pass for the mtr and just got off at each stop and explored till we were exhausted . </DOC> barbara chan provided prompt replies and was extremely helpful and descriptive .i arrived in front of the hotel via the free shuttle from the kowloon airport express station .immediately there were a few hotel employees who helped me and others get our luggage off the shuttle bus . upon walking into the lobby there were some other friendly employees who greeted and directed me to the front desk .derek handled my check - in and was very professional .immediately when i walked inside , the air was fresh and cool . </DOC> check - in was quick and staff friendly . was given a room on the 22nd floor .lots of tour groups , but hallways always seemed quiet .good buffet breakfast included in rate .lobby nice , all staff acknowledges the guests .and it is not inexpensive .hotel is well located just off nathan road .a subway stop is just around the corner . </DOC> very friendly helpful staff and very good location just off nathan road and near to the jade markets , ladies market .the mtr was just across the roadso very easy to get across to hong kong island or any of the outlying islands .i dread to think how small our original room would have been , as the upgraded room was adequate and had a good bathroom and facilities , butwe only ate breakfast there once and it was very good .they also provide free wifi and give you a smartphone that you can take out with you for location guidance and free local calls which was very helpful .so you can see we were mostly pleased with the hotel . </DOC> super location with easy reach to subway and public buses running along nathan road .we stayed here many times and have tried the superior room which is very small hardly any room to move around .the deluxe room is spacious enough but the room we stayed in seems old and not renovated yet .there is also no luggage rack and you have to specifically request from housekeeping .the premier deluxe is very spacious with good views .if you can , opt for the premier deluxe for more comfort . </DOC> the room was clean and comfortable . stayed on the 21st floor .fast and efficient lifts .ate two evening meals at the city cafe on the ground floor .highlight for me was baby lobster with green peppercorns .polite , helpful and efficient staff .great location in the bustling kowloon district . </DOC> i must say on hong kong standards the room is a good size , well decorated everything as expected .however , i specifically required a quiet room and was placed slap bang in front of the building site at the rear of the hotel !cityview it is not .... more like building site view .i advice anyone to stay on the waterloo side of hotel .everything else was acceptable ... maybe the wifi a little slow .i may come back again when they finish the building work ."

SUMMARY:  b'Been staying for business and the hotel is the best value for money. Pros: - very helpful staff and a good room with all the amenities you need and the staff were friendly and helpful . Hotel was clean but not as efficient as it had been in other Premier Inns I have stayed in . I was a bit disappointed with the room , and the shower was a bit noisy but for all the good value , clean , friendly , fast</DOC>'

SUMMARY:  b'this is a good hotel with the best view of the city. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful - rooms are ok but you need to pay extra for the water , the toilet was not working and toilet was in the shower only and bit hot! Room was clean and tidy but staff was friendly , I would stay again</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"the rooms are so small you have to be a contortionist , the mini bar is a joke , nowhere to put your luggage -and so it goes on .avoid at all costs . </DOC> we did n't book a room beforehand and rack rate offered by receptionist was convenient ( even some discount was applied ) .hong kong hotels are not cheap so the price is important argument here .good start indeed .pros : - excellent location within causeway bay , close to subway station and only easy tram ride to victoria peak ;if you are not fond of taxi , you do n't actually need it ; - breakfast was pretty good and included in rate automatically .- hotel interior looks a bit dated as well as room furniture , but it adds charm and the historical feeling ; - the bar on the basement floor is worth visiting but could be fully booked by liverpool fans on saturday night during premier league matchday .nothing you can dono real concerns , hotel serves its purpose .this hotel is just not suitable if you are looking for some luxury . </DOC> this hotel did not make an impression on first view , but rooms were clean and good , and breakfast was excellent .we were close to a major mall and buses and metro that we could walk to .food was good in the champs restaurant in the basement .concierge seemed to know what he was doing . </DOC> i stayed here three nights and found the room not only very clean but very comfortable and quiet .the hotel personnel were all very nice and the location of the hotel is excellent .the hotel is also between to subway stations and has a 7 - 11 at the next corner .the hotel also has a nice sports - type bar / restaurant in the basement .the breakfast buffet , which came with our room , was excellent with a wide variety of food and very good coffee . </DOC> our room was small , but unlike some of the other reviews , ours was modern and clean .we were on the 20th floor , and had a desk , with windows onto an interesting view of the high rise apartments on the hills , and a corner cupboard with coffee - makings and a working refrigerator .we had breakfast four mornings and thought there were very good choices of both hot and cold foods .one night we had the dinner buffet and enjoyed .our plane arrived at 6 am , and we were relieved and pleased that we were able to check in early and get some sleep .there is a lot variety of shops and restaurants within walking distance .the nearest subway stop is about 15 minute walk . </DOC> located in wanchai and extremely close to all way of public transport .\xf0\x9f\x87\xad \xf0\x9f\x87\xb0 for few days , good breakfast and many options to eat in neighbourhood to try local cuisine .very close to time square and shopping \xf0\x9f\x9b\x92 activities . </DOC> i have stayed here a number of times , and checking the website , the rooms looked like they have been updated .i was upgraded to a deluxe room , but it looked the same as the standard rooms i have stayed in previously .the baths and toilets were very old ( my toilet needed fixing as it would n't flush , which they fixed promptly ) .the chair in my room felt like it was ready to break and felt very unstable .i love the location of this hotel , it is close to everything , however they need to update a few more rooms .the food in the sports bar in the basement was ( as usual ) excellent . </DOC> we stayed at the charterhouse hotel in wan chai at the end of nov / early dec .small hotel in a convenient location within easy walking distance of times square and with a seven / eleven convenience store on the corner .good mid - range choice .good buffet breakfast and modern sports bar .efficient staff . would recommend a visit to the penninsular hotel for afternoon tea in sheer opulence !"

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'- cleaners do n\'t clean rooms fully ( room carpets do n\'t appear to get cleaned frequently - think last guests hairs , crumbs on carpets ... ) unless you complain .- guests ca n\'t enjoy the sun terrace unless they pay the rip - off prices for food at the restaurant ( over \xe2\x82\xac 36 per person , for a slightly better than average buffet ) .- reception do n\'t think twice about connecting unsolicited calls at 01.30am to your bedroom , waking you up .- swimming pool is closed for winter when the temperature outside is still high twentiesand it \'s advertised on their partner websites as being a key feature benefit of staying at the hotel .i could go on ...we wo n\'t be returning at this rate .i \'d rather take my custom elsewhere where staff put customers first . </DOC> discovery bay is really niceroom was nice and breakfast was pretty good .the pool area was lovely and well equipped .i had a 12 hour flight ahead of me so was prepared to pay for a late check out but was only given until 1 pm which was disappointing as hotel was not full but was told that they were expecting a large group ( even so most hotels will at least offer a room to get changed ) .a better rating had staff been more helpful </DOC> this hotel is really amazing , the location in the discovery bay hongkong and really quite surrounding and have amazing view .the hotel is near to disneyland hongkong and hkia .the scenery from room is amazing , the breakfast is very good , and the children playground is very good .so if you go to hongkong for family vacation , this hotel is the best .to city we can used the shutle bus to sunny bay mrt station , and to disneylnd we can used the free shuttle from the hotel ,to airport we can used public bus every one hour to airport . </DOC> the hotel itself is very well appointed inside , if a little unremarkable on the outside .it commands a superb position , with wonderful views of the sea and the mountains .our room was sumptuous and very spacious by hong kong standards .the pool and surrounds were excellent .breakfast was amazingly good - lots of choice , beautifully prepared and the service was impeccable .contrary to other opinions , we found travelling easy and quick on lantau , and most attractions are well served by modern , air - conditioned buses .central is easily reached by fast ferry and most have free wifi .however , there are several bars and restaurants on lantau where this service is provided free of charge . </DOC> the auberge was perfect for our short stay in hong kong with my family of five .upon check - in we were upgraded to oceanview rooms with a stunning views .for this area -the bathrooms are enormous !everyone here speaks english very well and are very friendly and professional and quick to help . </DOC> stayed here for 2 nights for a conference . never stayed in discovery bay before but since it \'s the only hotel in the area everyone knows where it is :-)maybe because it \'s near disneyland and it has its own beach , lots of families stay here .reminded me a lot of disney aulani ni honolulu where i stayed last year .having said that you can imagine very friendly service and big rooms .breakfast was also very good . </DOC> our room was spacious and had an amazing bathroom with a huge window giving on the bay .the staff was nice and very helpful . </DOC> i returned for the third time this year and the check - in process is extensive ( above 20 minutes ) .again my third - party website booking and payment could not be found in their system , but also questions about my residential address , and if my visa card ( it says on the face ) is a credit card are rather surprising .no way , as it is not on the room night menu ! " . please consider .'
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'the hotel is located on a very busy road but it was lovely to leave my car in the sun and walk in the sun. Rooms are clean & comfortable with all facilities and a pool area with full kitchen and restaurant and food & drinks! Very good staff - I would have no hesitation recommending The Hotel again</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"we wanted a short getaway to celebrate our special occasion and decided to have a staycation at village hotel changi , and we were happy with our choice !the good : service : check - in and check - out was a breeze .the counter staff were all smiles and very pleasant and friendly , making us feel very welcomed .so were the housekeeping staff , who would greet us heartily whenever we met :) throughout our stay, we also saw many instances of staff serving with a smile , and being helpful in general , so this was really thumbs - up !: we had a deluxe room at the top floor , which was quite spacious for 2 , with access to a small balcony , with a village view .actually , i think it was more of a forest view , which was great !we also got to watch the planes pass by :) </DOC> we stayed here before in february and were happy to stay again .after our trip to singapore , it 's a good hotel for your last night before you fly .they have shuttle runs to the airport that take approx .it 's a close walk to the beach area and local small restaurants .the food was disappointing this time , not as good .the rooms are basic enough , we had to have our son in with us even though we had paid for a good room with club access .we love the rooftop pool , very quiet and relaxing views of the beach .this is great for transit , if you arrive late from your destination and do n't want to go too far or before you fly , it 's a good spot . </DOC> i spent 2 nights here along with my family and had a decent stay .there is a decent breakfast spread .the swimming pool is relaxing .the rooms are pretty small and had a funny smell .the receptionists are not really friendly and made me queue for awhile without any guests in front of me .a hotel i will consider if the price is right ... </DOC> stayed here at end of a business trip to malaysia prior to flying out from changi the next morning . was pleasantly surprised with quality of the hotel and its location in the busy changi village area .shuttle to airport was handy too although rather infrequent so would not suit all flight times . </DOC> the room is quite basic - but bed is comfortable and wifi free .some milk and more than 2 teabags would be great .breakfast was varied and fine and room large .has a bath and access to foxtel as well .only 20 mins from airportbut there are nicer hotels closer to the airport if it is just a layover in my opinion . </DOC> i stay at this hotel when i ' ve an early flight as it 's much cheaper than the airport hotel .by taxi it 's about 20 minutes from the airport , but there 's a free shuttle on the hour if you are not time restricted .the lobby is nothing special but it 's modern and clean .check in is reasonably efficient .the best value is the club room ; there 's a good club lounge overlooking the water andpretty ok wine and cocktails .there 's some good local and reasonably priced cafes and restaurants just outside the hotel .the rooftop pool is great , overlooking the ocean , and on the same floor there 's an italian - ish restaurant , food was nothing special but the view is great and the beer is cold .the staff are efficient and friendly .a good choice , close to the airport , modern and clean </DOC> this is a great place to use as a stopover .the rooms were clean , comfortable and a good size .the staff friendly & helpful .we used the pool on the eighth floor , the views were stunning .there are lots of restaurants in changi village just five minutes walk up the road .the hotal offers a courtesy bus to the airport , we managed to use this on our journey back .we would stay a little longer next time as we would have liked to explore the area . </DOC> the location is unfortunately far from the city center , but however very convenient to go to pulau ubin or to enjoy changi village and the beach .it has 2 swimming pools , the one on the top is an infinity pool overlooking pulau ubin and with amazing views .the rooms are nice and the staff is okay .the prices are really good .book this hotel at the airport when you arrive , at the hotel association desk for a great discount , they also have a free shuttle from and to the airport ."
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'We originally picked this hotel on our way to the airport.Rooms are comfortable and clean but the staff are friendly and helpful .My only complaint was the lack of air conditioning in the room was not working properly. Good location for walking to shops and bars as well as the tram stop , good location but not close to centre & the train station. Cons: - No lift for luggage \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'its a 15 - 20 min taxi ride from the airport .they have free shuttle to the airport .there are many hawker centres when you go out on the right side , so no need to eat in the hotel . </DOC> there is a courtesy transfer between changi airport and the hotel roughly every hour , which was very handy for us .at the airport you have to go to the " ground transportation desk " to arrange the transfer , at the hotelwe had a really spacious double room on a quiet end of the large building .everything was nice and clean even though the rooms are not brand new .also , it was a real gem to be able to go swimming on the rooftop in the evening starlight after a long flight . </DOC> the checkin is always super efficient and friendly , the shuttle bus of great benefit and the rooms clean and full of all the amenities required .it was hopeless , i am not sure if this was just on our particular floor or general .i think after paying the $ 20 singapore , plus service charge , it should at least be hot .on the two occasions we had breakfast , it was spoilt for this reason alone .that said , the hotel is good value in a nice area to explore and eat . </DOC> i observed this hotel and its location to be very nice .nearby at walk - able distances there are shops , markets , bars and many food courts to pass time if one have and all these are value for money compliant .the staffs are very good , breakfast also , and about the room and other matter if cost is considered its great .i recommend this hotel to be a very cost effective and valued one one without compromising the key features and facts of a very good standard hotel .while i recommend this hotel to visitors , looking forward to visiting again too ... </DOC> lobby is big , lacks of warmth and furniture .staff is welcoming ad tries to sell you the usual upgrades .they are even written in the desk , you can not miss them .standard rooms are rather ruined down and not well maintained ( plenty of cracks on the sink , bathtub also old ) .room was average clean , lots of hair in the bathroom .towels are thin and not white any more .that day , issues on all elevators and keys to open the doors of the rooms .staff did not seem to really care .i would not recommend this option ,as for the price asked , it is a rip off . </DOC> we spent one night here waiting for an onward flight to hanoi , thinking it was near the airport .actually it is at least 20 minutes away by bus , and for convenience it \'s better to stay at the crowne plaza which is almost next to the airport .the hotel itself was ok and we slept well , as it \'s in a quiet area although there are shops nearby .the room lighting was a bit strange and the bedside light was not strong enough for reading in bed . </DOC> enjoyed my quick overnight stay here , for a layover .there are shuttles from the airport going here , but they leave every 60 - 90 minutes .arriving late at night , i just took a taxi , which cost me around s$10 .the room itself was pretty large for singapore standards , with modern , no - frills furnishing .nothing jaw - dropping , but the bed was large and comfortable , and the bathroom had a tub and shower , which were all i need after a long flight .they have a shuttle to the airport , the earliest of which leaves at 6 am .this is definitely a good option for a quick stay in the city , especially if you need to be near the airport . </DOC> hotel changi is ideally located near the water with great views and walking distance to ferries and parks near the water or busy market restaurants and local shops .the rooms are excellent and the staff ready to upgrade where possible .the views from the 7th floor overlooking the water are wonderful .the free transit bus to and from the airport is not only good for catching the plane , but also linking with the mrt to go downtown for the day .an excellent well appointed hotel in a very clean and tree - lined avenue in a nice location .we would like to come back again .'
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'For the money you can pay a lot for a basic room with a double bed and a pull out couch to the rear of the hotel , it is very quiet and nicely appointed . Staff are friendly and the food was good . Staff friendly & helpful. Pool area is also quite nice . Staff always friendly & helpful .</DOC>'

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'Got a room on the main floor with a small balcony which is not a problem for us. the hotel is very clean and tidy with good beds and bathrooms . Staff helpful and friendly . they have a buffet breakfast which i would recommend as there are many other options as well as the cafe & restaurant but not for leisure , staff were good , but i would stay there again</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"v hotel check in was quick and efficient .small room , no view .wifi purchased at hotel was not reliable .staff at front desk were amazing always helpful providing good options .housekeeping staff excellent .competitive money lender outside and supermarket with food outlets in close location . </DOC> this hotel is in an excellent location , right by a subway station so you can get to the heart of downtown , in just a few minutes .apart from the location though , there is not much else to commend this place .the hotel was full of ' coach trip ' groups so if you arrive at the same time as one of them , it can take you half an hour to check in .the staff , although superficially polite , appear to regard their guests as a nuisance and the breakfast offering is mediocre at best .whilst this hotel is not terrible by any means , for the money i spent , i ' m pretty sure that i could have done much , much better .i ' m unlikely to stay here again . </DOC> it was fine ...the room was a little small but had a cozy feel .very modern decor ...the pool was lovely , but the gym is very disappointing as it is very small with few equipment , some not functioning .it is a very small lobby so it can easily fill up .i appreciated there was enough staff to handle registrations and concerns .but seeing the stored luggage just laying out in view on a dozen or more steel shelves did not give us confidence in security , so we asked for a late check - out to keep our things safe in the room .taxi rides around singapore is one of the few inexpensive services in the city , so the v 's less than great location was not an issue . </DOC> not a bad hotel in not a bad location .it 's not to far to walk to bugisand it 's in - between the airport and the centre .being above the metro station is great ( especially give how dull it is in the locality ) .the hotel is relatively affordable .( cheap by singapore standards ) but the hotel let 's itself down a bit .my room stunk of cigarette smoke .and the wait for the lifts was far too long .my one tip ... do n't buy breakfast at the hotel .go downstairs and get something 's x cheaper ( and probably nicer ) .i ate the most wonderful fish for breakfast one day . </DOC> stayed here for one night after arriving to singapore and heading for penang the next day .the hotel is close to the airport ( you just take the mrt line from changi airport - no problem ! )the rooms are a bit small , but for short stays this hotel is perfect .good breakfast outdoors , nice swimmingpool and friendly staff .prices are good . recommend this hotel ! </DOC> check in and out was a bliss .we were not even 5 minutes in queue .great location : accessible via bus ( bus stop a few meters from the hotel ) , mrt ( basement ) and cab is available 24 hours .convenience of a fastfood which is open 24 hours and is just a few steps from the lobby .near mustafa , a 10 - 15 minute walk .we got triple sharing room at the 14th floor with a seascape view .the room location is great as it is a few steps from the elevator .bed quality were good and comfortable .lighting is good as several options are provided to make the room well lit or dimmer .wifi is at sg 10 for 24 hours and has fast connection .staff is courteous . recommending this place for groups and families . </DOC> situated on top of lavender mrt line which is just a few stations away to singapore airport .this is a superb choice for quick nightstops , short hops or instead of nightstopping in singapore airport .transportation to and from to the aiport is absolutely easy with the underground train .rooms are very small , reflected in the price - being a popular hotel - the price can be quite high sometimes though .toilets are small as well , but functional .food is easy to get , with a 24hr food court behind the hotel .service is spartan but sufficient for its level .instead of staying in the aiport area if you are on transit and require accommodation , this hotel is another viable and wonderful alternative with easy access to airport as the main reason . </DOC> the hotel location is great .it 's just besides the mrt and within little time you are in downtown singapore .the rooms are extremely small : my bed just fits in it and my chair is against the bed while writing this review .rooms are rather noisy .conclusion : if you do n't really care about your hotel you can book a room here .if you 'll enjoy a little bit of luxury or quietness i would suggest you to find something else ."

SUMMARY:  b'Second time at this hotel and it is a lovely place to stay. the location is right next to the train station and close to the main square with bars nearby. Good views from the rooms with 2 double beds & a good sized bathroom & shower cubicle (no bath) and breakfast bar area ok but no toiletries or a small gym as well as bar & breakfast area is close to the hotel which is good for business travellers. Hotel bar was good & staff were friendly & accommodating</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"the hotel was quite expensive when we booked it on a recommnedation from a friend .the room was mdoern with all the basic amenities .the staff was courteous and very willing to help .i would stay here again if the price is right . </DOC> a pleasant stay which was well served by lounge staff ; ms ivory & jolly just to name a few .they were friendly , helpful & served with smile & passion .hotel in excellent location with easy access to shopping malls & public transportation . </DOC> surprised that rooms and public areas have been significantly improved .however , the move upmarket ( as reflected in the price ) was not matched by the service .while the staff were friendly , service was slow and unreliable .hotel was also overcrowded ; forget breakfast in the main restaurant in the morning unless you like queuing and sharing a table with several strangers ; while you could also get breakfast in the executive lounge , the food on offer was poor .good location though a lot better than it was , but for this money i have stayed in much better places close by .try the royal plaza on scotts . </DOC> we booked in here yesterday for a couple of nights , close to where we needed to be for business .the check in was reasonably quick , but the room 304 was very disappointing .basic is how i would describe the room .tea and coffee making facilities available , the bathroom would not have been decorated years ago .the internet is appalling for a hotel in 2018.the location is good for access to orchard road restaurants .we left our do n\xe2\x80\x99t disturb sign on only to come back to a cleaner in the room . </DOC> there is no better location in singapore - right in the middle of the orchard area , walking distance to major shopping venues , the mrt as well as the botanic gardens .but , the standard rooms are very ordinary , usually with little to no natural lighting , rather run down .the rest of the hotel is pretty average including the pool- it looks as if it 's waiting for ' en bloc ' , the singaporean expression for property sale to a developer .so , if you want the location suggest you avoid the standard rooms . </DOC> this hotel had a nice lobby with friendly and welcoming staff .they were helpful with our various questions about directions and transport , especially nassriq .the room was very nice and a good size .it was very clean and the bed was extremely big and comfortable .the bathroom was a good size with nice toiletries .the pool area was nice although we did n't use it .there were good facilities in the room .this service was brilliant andin all my hotel stayswe had a room only as we did n't want to pay $ 20 for a big buffet breakfast . </DOC> more spectacular were the great services by the new team of the staff in club lounge .they were meg , faizal and kingston who 's friendly , helpful and served with passion and smiles .the hotel is strategically located in city and easily accessible to public transport including train station .also to many and varied f & b outlets and shopping malls .i am sure i will be back again ., indeed , a pampered stay . </DOC> we are in singapore quite regularly and this was our first stay at the orchard parade hotel .nice hotel and friendly staffservice is good , room was comfortable , and the price per night reflects the quality and grading of the hotel . if you are after a clean comfortable room without the add - ons , conveniently located and close to the orchard road shopping precinct , then the orchard parade hotel is a good choice .room was quite spacious and we were allocated a room right at the end of the hall way which was great as it was away from the lifts .great wi - fi and efficient house - keeping team .all in all a comfortable 2 day stay and definitely will be back \xe2\x80\xa6 ."
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'Unexpectedly stay here with friends for a week in the city and found the hotel to be very good value for money. the room was clean with good sized beds and good quality food and drinks in the bar. Staff is friendly & helpful , location is good - a few minutes walk from the city centre & you can walk to all the main attractions & villas</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"we came here as part of a tour of northern chile and easter island , staying on three separate occasions for just 1 - 2 nights each .it 's a well - appointed , small hotel converted from town houses - because it has three staircases !good , comfortable rooms with plenty of space .central location close to two metro railway lines .nice roof terrace with view through glass floor right down to the ground floor . </DOC> our room was spacious and comfortable , bedlinen was exquisite , the bathroom was luxurious .the hotel oozes cool chic but is comfortable too .the breakfast was the best we had in a two week stay in south america .the restaurant is excellent .the location is very central , although some central parts of santiago are a little gloomy ( such as the shopping malls ) and insalubrious , but it does mean that all the main central sights are within walking distance .staff are helpful and attentive but unobtrusive .the hotel is very good value for money , given the level of comfort and location . </DOC> this hotel is small and in a location near the big park and fort .the rooms are modern , clean and comfortable .the breakfast buffet is very nice with fresh fruit and pastry .the staff are very nice and friendly .there are places to eat within walking distance .we enjoyed a three night stay . </DOC> this place had an amazing mix of old and new .they did a sensational job of remodeling it .our room was quite impressive , it was n't hugeour balcony was ridiculously hugeand we really enjoyed sitting out there .i do n't recall hearing any street noise .it is a 2 min walk to the truly beautiful castillo hidalgo and the fountain neptuno .it is about about a 5 min walk to the barrio lastarria which had tons of restaurants and some great street vendors .it was about a 10 min walk to the plaza de armas and museums .there is a lovely rooftop bar .all of the staff was wonderful !we really loved this hotel ! ! </DOC> a travel company recommended this hotel to us for a two nights stay in santiago .the hotel combines modern facilities and design perfectly with an older building - the interior design is extraordinary .rooms were large with very comfortable mattresses .bathroom had large walk - in shower .breakfast selections were not that impressive , but they were ok .service people at the hotel were very friendly and helpful in directing us around the area .there is a supermarket behind the hotel ( you have to walk around the block to get to front entrance of supermarket ) .one of santiago 's main restaurant areas , with many fine restaurants , is located only about 7 - 10 minutes walk from the hotel , making the location very convenient .the main shopping district in this area of santiago is also a 10 minute walk from the hotel , including the seafood market . </DOC> fabulous building , junior suite great and an ok price for capital city and decor .staff very pleasant .a quibble however on the coffee in rooms .3usd for one capsule is daylight robbery and leaves an annoying memory of what should be a super stay .please take on board , we stay around the world and are not mean , but things like this are unnecessary .loved the neighbourhood however . </DOC> the interiors and the rooms are simply beautiful .there are various sizes of rooms , in a cozy modern style .the beds are sublime , loved the duvet !staff is extremely friendly and helpful .and the breakfast is quite extensive .this is the place to be when in santiago , for the leisure or business traveller . </DOC> we decided to spend our first night in chile in santiago , it was n't easy to decide where to stay in town as most ppl would suggest staying in residential areas , however with less than 24h in the capital we decided to stay close to the sights and book a place at the border with lastarria / bellas artes being our honeymoon we went for a notch above our usual and found hotel magnolia on mr & mrs smith .i had in fact forgotten about the mms thing until we got there and wowed at it ! from the entrance , the lobby the nice perfume in the air, this is definitely a special place .the room was massive , all planked up with wood ( no mountain chalet effect though ! )"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'Threading is a good hotel with a very warm welcome and the staff were all helpful and polite. rooms are spacious , bathrooms clean and tidy , the view of the lake was stunning , the hotel was well serviced with large car park which was useful for our needs . Staff were friendly & helpful , they have a small bar & restaurant but the food was good but the staff were not as helpful as other hotels</DOC>'

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'stayed in this hotel for one night whilst we had a great time in the city with the view and the location. Staff are friendly and helpful but the reception area is very dark and needs a bit of TLC. However, the rooms were fine and very clean but bathroom poor , wifi poor, no tea and coffee in room . Well done</DOC>'

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'Been here a few times in the past few years . Had a very comfortable bed and bathroom with large balcony which is perfect for the price. the staff were lovely and helpful and the room was big and comfortable . the staff could not be more helpful but they were unable to provide a good stay , Breakfast was good with hot and cold food , good</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'the staff in this hotel are always very friendly and you feel welcome every time you stay at this hotel .the facilities however are a bit old and some renovations would do it good .internet is available in the rooms and lobby but overpriced unfortunatelly . </DOC> if you happen to get stuck in suva , this is a nice place to stay .it \'s on the waterbut no useable beach , short walk from downtown suva .reception and staff are quite pleasant .small bar with a nice outdoor area around the pool .the food was decent .room was large and clean with a comfortable bed and a selection of australian and new zealand tv channels . </DOC> very friendly staff .from the outside it does not look that great .but from the inside it is really nice .refurbished rooms , large rooms , fast wifi , nice restaurant , bar area , swimming pool and spa with views onto the bay .nice restaurants and shops within walking distance . </DOC> based on price this is a disappointment , but on brand it is reasonable , but with \xe2\x80\x9c island charm \xe2\x80\x9d .or so it was sorted .island charm \xe2\x80\x93despite this everything was done with a smile ; we were upgraded to a harbour view and the sandwich was half price .the take - home message is do n\xe2\x80\x99t expect first world efficiency , relax and enjoy the charm .the room itself was ok \xe2\x80\x93 a bit dated but clean and functional .others have noted the poor airflow in the building leading to musty smells .the pizza was good , but breakfast overpriced , we tried it once and then went elsewhere . </DOC> stayed here for 2 nights for business . booked a king sized bed but had a very messy check in sitting waiting for an extended time for a room that did n\'t exist .we were upgraded to an " executive " room with a queen bed .it was not well handled but staff were pleasant and we were offered free wifi as compensation .the hotel is tired and breakfast was not brilliant though the omelette was good .location is handy to town which suited us for meetings and the concierge staff were friendly and helpful .it \'s a good place to sit outside at dusk and watch the sun go down . </DOC> this is the second review of this hotel in suva - conveniently located , reasonably priced and with everything that the business traveler needs , including a functioning internet connection everywhere .the best feature of the hotel is the staff - genuinely friendly , welcoming , warm - hearted and helpful .the hotel is good for those who want to go out for running - the sea promenade starts right at the hotel and it is possible to safely and easily run around 10k back and forth ! </DOC> there \'s not much choice in suva .this must be the only choice for business travellers .it \'s not terrible , but it \'s pretty basic .old rooms , old bathrooms .musty smell in the rooms .when i checked in they kindly offered me \' an upgrade \' which makes me worrywhat would it have been like if i did n\'t have the upgrade .my room was on the first floor , facing a building site .check in , check out was extremely slow to the point of unprofessional .best thing : nice poolside dining with expat scene and nice pizza , beers etc .ask for a ground level room facing the pool .there is nowhere else to stay , but do n\'t expect much . </DOC> the holiday inn is a good hotel in suva .it is close to parliament and the city which is good for business travellers .the rooms are large but dated .the food is good with an outdoor pizza kitchen where they play live music .the staff are friendly and nice .'
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b"Second time staying here and it is still a good value for money. the hotel is a very nice property with good facilities and good facilities with very good staff. good value for money but the price was not as good as the first time but the staff were friendly and efficient The rooms were ok but the bathroom was in need of upgrading, I\xe2\x80\x99d not recommend the 'higher' high standard but they have been refurbished .</DOC>"

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"hotel is new compared to other marriott properties .staff is wonderful and care for the clients .the hotel has a business center on the lobby floor for the clients .it is pretty close to old town and the center of sarajevo .although the hotel is located on a local street .the river is close by .the breakfast in the morning is well presented and the staff is attentive . </DOC> very helpful front desk .high room as requested , a suite with a little terrace and a view over the old city; too cold to make use of ! very well appointed rooms , good towels .bed very comfortable with nice sheets .great location for our visit to the city .breakfast was fine , the warm selection not so good . </DOC> the hotel is not situated far away from the old town .it will take you around 15 minutes to reach to the town .it is alcohol free and a mosque is few steps away .the hotel is new , and has simple furniture .the staff is friendly , and the hotel has good security . </DOC> this is a great location within walking distance of center sarajevo and tram distance of everything else .underground parking ( a great thing in sarajevo ) , a good continental breakfast that actually stretches the ' continental ' part in my opinion .rooms are well laid out , we had a large bathroom , nice seating area and a good view of the city . </DOC> nice and clean , comfortable large rooms , underground garage keeping the car defrosted , friendly staff , good location near all the attractions , so all in all a very good option for sarajevo . </DOC> this is a very well run and kept residence inn by marriott hotel .it is just a few minutes walk from the latin bridge , the ottoman bazaar and the center holding many additional monuments .also the downtown with its variety of restaurants and bars .overall , it was a very nice experience with friendly and helpful employees . </DOC> the location of the hotel is great , only a few minutes walk away from the old town .there is also a little grocery store just around the corner , great for simple things such as fruits and water .it does have onsite parking .it 's underground , so you have to drive into an elevator , and the elevator would take you down to -2 level for parking .all in all , i would recommend this hotel for visiting sarajevo . </DOC> convenient location just over the bridge from the town centre .very friendly check - in , spacious room with a big shower and plenty of storage space .also a kitchenette with sinc , full size fridge , microwave and dishwasher , plus crockery and utelsils .comfy beds , free wifi ( that did not reach as far as the bed ); beds tended to drift away from the wall if you sat up reading , a chair placed at the foot of the bed solved this . excellent ' continental ' breakfast that included pastries , bread , juices , cold meats , cheeses , fruit and also very good scrambled eggs , bosnian sausage , fried potatoes .the hotel has a pleasant lounge area with interesting books and a couple of workstations ( could not find the @ symbol ) ."
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'this hotel is in a great location with a large car park to the ground floor and the swimming pool area is nice , with plenty of space to sit outside. the staff were friendly and helpful but only one person working was very helpful and friendly , but no lift so no lift but not a problem as it was good</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"good hotel in central sofia , within comfortable walking distance from some of the city 's main attractions .helpful staff , quick check in / check out , massive bedroom and a rather good choice at breakfast time .i felt the lobby area and lifts looked somewhat dated and in need of an upgrade .overall , a comfortable stay . </DOC> this fairly modern hotel is right in the middle of everything , an easy walk to just about all points of interest and the main shopping / eating / drinking street .it 's about about 15lv ( 8 euro ) to / from the airport .the yellow taxi desk next to the car rentals in arrivals will get you sorted and avoid the taxi touts .that got us a huge ( 60sq / m+ ) room with a comfortable queen bed .all the staff we encountered were very polite and happy to help out with local knowledge .i would n't hesitate to stay here again if i returned to sofia . </DOC> amazing rooms , comfortable bed with extra pillows and duvets if needed .if i search for a minor criticism it would be that the flat screen tv is top small to be viewed from the bed as the room is so large . </DOC> this hotel is located right in the heart of sofia .the impressive wood panelled lobby and first floor give the hotel a five star feel .it was very large with a lovely wood panelled entrance hall , large bedroom andclean , well appointed and bright enhanced the room .the bed was comfortable and the air - conditioning was adequate .and the hot water in the shower was prone to suddenly become extremely hot making it dangerous .from the hotel you can walk to all of the major sights of sofia with no problems .the concierge service was also very goodand i asked the concierge about a jeweller nearby .he immediately looked one up within walking distance and called to make sure the watch could be looked at .we went and the service in the store was excellent .breakfast in the hotel was very good with a hot egg station . </DOC> everything about this 5 star hotel is grand with an old world charm .i typically prefer more modern hotels , but this property has many things to offer - located near the pedestrian zone with large public lobby , exceedingly large rooms with every amenity you can imagine including the most amazing bathroom and productsi ' ve ever experienced , wonderful breakfast buffet , and the most incredibly professional and friendly staff .that being said , the rooms smelled a bit musty and i find most hotel beds uncomfortable </DOC> we had upgraded to a corner suite which was an excellent large room facing towards the mountains , and good value .hotel main bar was very quietthe restaurant was surprisingly good with an excellent selection of bulgarian and international dishes .good selection of wines .not very busy though . </DOC> visited on business during the freezing low season , the price vs . quality and service was unmatched in sofia .the rooms are huge , you even get complementary wine when you arrive plus they provide fresh bottle of water everyday at no charge .the hotel restaurant actually has an interesting menu and the food is quite excellent .location is perfect for exploring the limited must see sites .( frankly , there is not really any must see site ) </DOC> this is an ideal hotel for tourists as it 's right in the centre of town .the service in the hotel is spot on and the whole place is clean , tidy and well - presented .there was plenty of choice at breakfast and the staff were very friendly .it 's not the cheapest hotel in sofia - in fact it may well be the most expensive -but it 's certainly very good value compared to hotels of this calibre in other cities ."

SUMMARY:  b'this hotel is a great place to stay for the price its worth the money . Good location , good sized rooms , good and clean , good wi fi , the room and bathroom were clean , staff friendly , helpful and pleasant . i\xe2\x80\x99d rather stay in the city centre .</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'very impressed with this place - not only is it impeccably designed , but the staff hit the right balance between friendliness and efficiency .excellent breakfast as well .location allows for an easy walk to many of the city \'s main sights . </DOC> as for hilton , the service in all areas was top - notch and on par with fairmont .the menu diversity and quality of food in the restaurant was equal to or better than hyatt .the rooms were smaller than hyatt and fairmont , but generally the same level as hyatt be not quite as deluxe as fairmont .i prefer the location of the hyatt , but depending on where you need to go and interests , fairmont and hilton are n\'t bad .so staying at hilton is a easy , great decision !this was disappointing because the rooms sizes feel smaller than fairmont and hyatt -- and i prefer larger rooms . </DOC> very common in asia and now in europe as well .but it \'s a wasted effort on us business travelers who want the stuff in our rooms to be simple .i hope the corporate folks are reading this and will stop the led touchpad switch nonsense .also , the shower leaked water onto the bathroom floor - the plastic seal on the glass door did not work .positives about the hilton kyiv is that it is stone quiet , has a great breakfast buffet and it is spotless .the fitness center is average , no windows but well equipped . </DOC> business trip in february 2015 , excellent customer service throughout , food was very nice andthe front of house staff were very helpful in supplying taxis , information and printing facilities .good location to the train station and city centre . </DOC> rooms are rather spacious and with all confort and tech facilities you can imagine ( i experienced a problem with the connexion to the wifi , but got solved by the kind staff at the reception ) .you get free access to a spa and fitness area .the fitness area is a bit small .the hotel is close to the university and 30 minutes walking distance from maydan .as for the airport , it takes arround 40 minutes by taxi . </DOC> everything was more than fine , and while the room , the premises were spotless , staff really made me fell like at home .it was a great experience , and i do really recommend this place .it \'s ideally located , and worked perfectly for me .i \'ll surely go back there . </DOC> the junior suite was very comfortable and had great amenities .food at the park was fantastic and the executive lounge had first class staff , service and snacks as well as great views .however for me the highlight is the staff .they were amazing .friendly , polite and always helpful .a great stay . </DOC> the place looks brand new , and everything was perfect .rooms are outstanding , breakfast is great , really nothing to complain about .maybe the atmosphere is a bit " cold " in the huge lobby , and it is surely not the best atmosphere in town , but this is really secondary for me .i \'ll surely be back there .'
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'Returned to the last minute for business and found the staff very friendly and professional. Hotel is big with excellent views of the city , good breakfast , with good service , and food was good & rooms well appointed . Would recommend for business travellers. If you have to be in a car, try to stay somewhere else</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEW:  b'we stayed here as part of tour of panama .if you like to go to beaches where there is nothing to do , this place is for you .it is remote and had no planned activities -- or much of anything else .it was billed as all - inclusive , but you were limited to buffet meals and bottom shelf liquor .very few of the staff spoke or understood any english ( bartenders should at least recognize the names of various wines and liquors ) .the dining hall where the buffet was served had no sound deadening and there seemed to be screaming children no matter when you decided to eat .i would select this for myself .although it is beachfront , there is no beach at high tide and the rocky beach extends forever at low tide .</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'the design and layout is cool and carefully thought through and made it feel as if the hotel was not at capacity .there were always areas to achieve privacy , free tables , loungers , space by the sea edge and pool .the water taxi to the wall of dubrovnik was a great idea and amenity .the rooms are not the largest but the hotel clings to the sea edge so it is not surprising that space is at a premium , however they are very well appointed .the food covers all the bases from everyday casual to fine dining and a special mention must go to the rooftop bar - a cocktail as the sun goes down looking at the walled citywas very special , no matter how many times we repeated the treat . </DOC> the hotel is situated close to the old city- a mere 10 min walk .close enough to explore easily but away from the crush of tourists from the cruise ships .a complimentary hotel boat also does hourly runs to the harbour for those not keen on walking .the room was clean and had all necessary amenities .a roof top bar the perfect setting to watch the sun fall behind the city walls .prices in the hotel were steep , with both food and drinks expensive . </DOC> beautiful hotel in a lovely location overlooking the sea with a view of the old city .located about 20 minutes walking time to the old city , so consider this if you are looking for something closer .( there is a water taxi - weather permitting - as well as a shuttle , but then you are tied to that schedule . )the entire staff was outstanding and service was faultless .this is a fairly new property , and the rooms were beautiful and more spacious than many luxury european hotels .there was a curtain that could be pulled to provide privacy between the main wall of the bathroom and the sleeping area , but none on the wall outside the bathroom - providing a direct line of sight from outside the bathroom to the toilet / bidet as well as the showerhonestly , who ever thought of this design ? ? </DOC> overall , enjoyed my stay there , really a cool place , restaurant and bar staff were really excellent and helpful .the servicing of the room was hit and miss ,on check out i asked the reception why she insisted on the nightly turndown service at 6 o\'clock at night, i was told it was because the hotel was full ! at 650 euro a nighti expected better , there was one bar of soap for the two wash basins and bath , my wife and i like soap instead of bath gel , 2 pieces of soap at these prices surely should be expected ?so generally great surroundings , bar and restaurant excellent , but lots of little management issues which would make the stay more enjoyable . </DOC> this hotel is gorgeous .the view from the room of the adriatic is spectacular .the bed and linens were very comfortable and we slept well .the " beach " and swimming area and the short boat ride to and from the old city .staying at villa dubrovnik was a special experience in a wonderful location . </DOC> this is an amazing hotel , really worth visiting .in other words this is called amazing personal service .the rooms are big with wall to wall balcony doors offering great views to lokrum island and the old city .the furniture are modern and so is the bathroom with attention to detail .it is very pleasurable staying in the room as you relax totally .the bed is comfy and big and the balcony furniture simple but comfortable .the architecture of the hotel is very inviting and fresh .the reception staff is very helpful and professional .we will definetely return to villa dubrovnik and would recommend wholeheartedly . </DOC> every thing about this hotel is excellent .breakfast is very good . free boat trip to town .wonderful indoor / outdoor swimming pol .great place to stay . </DOC> one really could not ask for a more beautiful hotel with more helpful staff !villa dubrovnik is right on the water- it is situated about 1 mile from townso you do not have to deal with the noise or the crowds .i also found that the walk to town was quite peaceful and preferred the walk to taking the regular shuttle .the rooms have beautiful views of the water and the island across the way .one fantastic feature of this hotel is the staff - they were available for anything that you might need and happy to make arrangements for tours and meals .i would happily stay at this hotel again !'

SUMMARY:  b"Easy to get to from the main centre of the city of the city and the hotel is very quiet with a great view of the lake. Rooms are good and beds comfy and clean . But overall a bit more expensive , if you are looking for a cheap price , you won\xe2\x80\x99t be disappointed . Not much else to say but it's not cheap , they have good food , but not bed , breakfast , poor</DOC>"

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'responsive staff when making our reservation .we look a cab from the train station .the rooms were super clean and comfortable .they provided a map and advice given our interest .we did not want to do a formal tourso we ended up taking a cab to the bus stationand then the local bus to bran castle which is worth a visit .we could walk to the other sites in town .we heard the free tour offered was really goodbut we already had something planned during that time .great place to walk and people watch and a wonderful selection of outdoor dining ( make sure you go to the pastry shops ) !we had a nice dinner at gott restaurantwould recommend and definitely stay again . </DOC> a nice room once i found the air - con hand control hiding in a cupboard - the access stairs were a real heart attack promoter !room 314 - be warned .everything else was fine - the owners appreciating what us soft westerners want and expect . </DOC> this was the choice of our tour guide and set up as part of our tour .the room was a little small and the staff had to find the ac controls as the weather did get warm .the breakfast was very good and the staff helpful .bed was comfortable and we slept well .the water was hot for a good shower . </DOC> the price is very reasonable for the value and size of the room .it was all exposed beams and old - fashioned furniture , but with a modern spa in the bathroom .the hotel is directly on the main square and in a great spot for sightseeing and restaurants .having written that , i would definitely stay here and in this room again . </DOC> we had a one night stay in brasov and booked at this hotel .it was directly across from the town square .morning breakfast was included and had a good selection of choices .our room was spacious and quiet .the staff was very friendly .we were with a private car and driver but parking was still an issue .if we were driving our own car , i do not know how we would have been able to drop off our luggage and put it in the car the next day .the staff was vert friendly and spoke good english . </DOC> bella muzica continues to deliver .the service was impeccable , the rooms nice and clean , and the location is the best in town , in piata sfatului , the central piazza of brasov .check out the vatra ardealului patisserie a couple of doors down the street ! </DOC> this is one of the best value hotels i have ever stay in !the rooms are amazing , the staff are great , the breakfast is one of the best in romania ( for eastern european standards )i would strongly recommend this hotel .you ca nt beat there location ! </DOC> perfect location if you want to visit brasov , very good price , excellent service , room was quiet and comfortable and the place is beautiful .and we strongly recommend it specially if you are looking for a romantic eve we arrived by trainand we took a taxi from the train station ; it was 5 times more expensive than the taxi called by the hotel on the way back !advise : call the hotel on arrival to send you a cab !do not hesitate to ask the front desk for recommendations for places to visit or eat ; we had done a lot of research prior to the trip yet the staff made us discover some gems !'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"very basic transit hotel with all basic amenities .it \xe2\x80\x99s good for short stay .we ca n\xe2\x80\x99t find any thing in the room , even charge basis .fridge is empty .not good food options also .but quite ok to stay for short .they provide shettle bus from airport </DOC> the bar and restaurant was closed but there 's a 24 hour costa in the foyer selling drinks and snacks .the rooms are good with tv , tea / coffee making , a fridge and a very comfy bed and pillows .this hotel has free wifi throughout .and they 're all equally good, i wish there were more in the centre .i took the free shuttle bus to terminal 3 the next morning for my next flight , overall good and recommended . </DOC> the only problem we had was finding the transfer bus to hotel after our flight from bombay , it was very confusingso we ended up getting a taxi .i am sure it is easybut nobody seemed to know where to go .on the flip side the bus back to the airport come twice an hour and is free .was very impressed and will stay here again if i have a very short stopover . </DOC> nice welcome and courteous check in . room was clean and big enough and typical premier inn with 2 free bottles of mineral water .the hotel had a good bar serving all alcohol and a nice restaurant .it is very close to the airport and there is a courtesy bus to the airport .the bus takes about 20mts to terminal 1 .overall well worth the money we spent . </DOC> spacious , clean , quiet , airconditioned , with refrigerator and flatscreen tv ) , but we wo n't stay there again , even overnight , because the room is rather dated and unappealing .the hotel location is poor , with nothing of interest nearby ( other than the airport ) .thankfully , food and drink are available in the hotel , and the free 30-minutely shuttle bus is reliable .however , we would recommend staying somewhere much nicer in dubai , such as the pullman mall of the emirates hotel , which is further from the airport but has excellent rooms and excellent location . </DOC> the hotel provided a shuttle bus from the airport which came after a wait of only 10 minutes .rooftop pool was a great way to cool off .shuttle to festival city mall worked well too .hotel was very clean and people friendly .would stopover here again . </DOC> was reliable , the hotel was modern with good bedroom and facilities and pricewas very reasonable . for an overnight stay in dubai we consider the hotel suited our purpose .the shuttle back to the airport was overcrowded and cases constantly fell on to my partner as the shuttle cornered .which could have caused an injury , something to watch out for if using the shuttle .apart from this the can be recommended . </DOC> the premier in inside the airport was a great option .finding the hotel lobby was a bit confusing .once located , check in was easy and the room was perfect for a layover rest .the airport is open 24/7 and has many shopping options .i would book here again ."
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'the hotel is located right off the Interstate with easy access to restaurants and shopping. Very convenient to the airport and very close to shopping and restaurants. Rooms were clean and tidy but a bit noisy with a window (no windows) but it was lovely and a good nights sleep & breakfast</DOC>'

SUMMARY:  b'Easy to find with only a few minutes to the airport in the evening and at the end of our stay . Very good service , good room , very good , clean . Parking is a bit tight as parking is very limited . Not a big deal but it would be nice to stay longer and stay for longer.</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'a solid 8 minutes walk to al rigga metro station , spacious rooms .its located on the " kinda of \' service road , so you should go across the small road to get taxi .it would be a nice stay , however there \'s a recruitment going on during my stay , so lobby is a bit cramped .other than that , its a nice joint to stay in dubai </DOC> have stayed in lots of hotels in different areas of dubai and this trip needed somewhere convenient for airport .this place was excellent from the moment i arrived .ok it is n\'t 5 star but rooms are good , food and choice superb butwhat makes this place is the staff everyone regardless of their job offered 5 star service and so friendly too would definitely stay again . </DOC> it has every thing which a modern vacation traveler is looking for or can need .1 ) amazing staff : i wish if bessel , the restaurant manager is reading this , " i did n\'t feel like having breakfast today at home , not seeing you around " .you service and personal touch was amazing and stands outs .i have traveled around the world a little and have interacted with possibly the best and worst in business ....i can easily rank you amongst the best ., your crew , especially winnie , i must thank from all heart for having taken care of our family every morning .the support and warmth your staff as given was amazing . </DOC> it is reasonably priced and is situated in deira , at the heart of dubai .the rooms are clean , staff friendly and the breakfast offeriing is good too .just one point to mention . </DOC> the breakfast was great , the room was large + spotlessly clean .the rooftop pool was great + as this was more of a business hotelit was usually empty ! !great location - near the creek - a walk along the dhow wharfage is highly recommended !there is a lovely persian restaurant over the road from the hotel + there is also a supermarket just over the road too .i have been to dubai at least 15 times both on business + on holiday + would definitely stay here again ! </DOC> i booked in for a night with my wife on the way to kathmandu .the service on arrival was friendly and efficient .we used them to book taxis and for travel advice .the hotel is conveniently placed near a metro stop and there is a supermarket and restaurants around the corner .the interior is modern , very clean and the rooms are a great size .it was a comfortable bed .they went to a lot of effort and it was a lovely touch . </DOC> i had booked a 1br furnished apartment .it was quite big in size with separate bed room and sitting areas .people were helpful and nice .breakfast was also good .airport terminal 1 as well as 2 are less than 15 minutes from the hotel .rigga metro is about 6/7 minutes walking .nearby you can find many restaurants including indian etc . , deira city centre and al ghurair mallboth are less than 10 minutes from the hotel and also nearby there are few departmental stores , super market etc ,, overall i would rate it as good stay . </DOC> the hotel is only some 15 minutes from the airport so is conviently located but is also situated ina quite side street off the main road so sleeping is no problem whatsoever .water , tea and coffee were complimentry in the room .breakfast was excellent with large choice to suit all tastes .staff helpful anf friendly .'
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'Been in a few hotels in the area , and it is not cheap but the hotel is in a great location . Friendly staff , rooms clean and spacious . i would say it was a bit of a let down with no air con or air conditioning in the room. Staff very helpful . wifi in the shower is not as good as other hotels have.</DOC>'

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'Threading is a real gem in the heart of the city. the staff are wonderful and the room was spacious , nice and clean , towels and towels were well appointed , hotel staff very nice , food was very good , and they were full of itinerary , but i have stayed in many hotels with better , but this resort has a big pool and sauna ( which is not a big deal , with the exception of the main hotel , the rooms , food and service excellent)</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'the rooms are comfortable , well thought out , and uniquely decorated .the only downside is parking ( if you have a car ) .i have and i will continue to recommend this hotel to our friends looking for a unique stay in dubai . </DOC> this place is located in old dubai near dubai creek and is a little hard to find at first , but it is worth it .it is a quiet place , clean , great staff , good vegetarian food and free wifi .it is a nice escape from the busy city life .the dubai creek and souq are really close and plenty of shopping and museums .you must try this for a weekend . </DOC> this hotel is lovely with artwork throughout .it is difficult to find by taxi .it is also not directly accessible by a vehicle and requires a walk of 3 - 5 minutes from taxi drop off points .it is located in a historical district with many opportunities for walking .we found the food to be generally quite good .our room had stone floors and a renovated modern bathroom .we would certainly stay here in the future .the hotel staff was professional and responsive to our requests .the hotel internet was free , reliable , and fast . </DOC> dubai is all about 5 - 7 star hotels , bigger , the better .and this delivered in spades .loved the hotel , the rooms , the local environment .try it , you wo n\'t regret it ! </DOC> this hotel is really special .it \'s another world compared to the skyscraper hotels in the rest of the city .xva is cosy , authentic and an oasis of peace .the hotel has an art gallery , beautiful arabic architecture , patio \'s with trees , and a rooftop terrace .every room is decorated in a unique way and gives you all the comfort you need .the surrounding area is the old part of dubai with mosques , narrow streets and arabic architecture .it \'s a 10 min walk to the metrostop al fahidi .staff was very helpful .lunch and dinner are very good and the beautiful patio stimulates your appetite for sure ! </DOC> i stayed at the xva hotel with my wife whilst in dubai for business .i chose it as a genuinely dubai experience .the hotel is an old residence of a wealthy emirati family which was converted into a hotel at be 20 years ago .i would recommend this hotel if you want an authentic experience and not a flashy , false and pretentious hotel .if you want to visit dubai in summer , you will get a 50 % discount or more if you stay during ramadan . </DOC> as mentioned before by others the xva art hotel is a small hotel situated in the older part of dubai ( bastakia ) .this gives the hotel a more authentique atmosphere , escpecially at night when all the tourists are gone from this area .although a bit difficult to find due to the labyrinth of small streets , you can get a taxi near the hotel ( 5 min walk ) .the hotel lies near the central bus station , the underground station ghubaiba , the old souk , the taxi boats of the creek and the al fahidi fort .so a wonderful base to explore dubai .the rooms in the hotel are small but nicely decorated .in my opinion the \' arty \' part of the hotel is a bit of a marketing trap but ok there is a gallery and a shop with a few art pieces . </DOC> dubai during ramadan is n\'t the best for sightseeing , the museum was closed as were the surrounding attractions .and of course there \'s nowhere to drink or eat outside until after sunset .this is hardly the hotels faultbut as it \'s in the heart of the " old town " which is itself nothing but a tourist enclave it was a disappointment .it is a tastefully done renovation with atmospheric courtyards and beautifully decorated thematic rooms a little small but cozy ..it \'s perfect if you dislike the touristic glam and glitz of the much lauded show piece eye sore \'s .an excellent breakfast great local vegetarian food , charming friendly polite staff , beautiful artworks abound ......'

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'Been here for three nights with a friend and it was a great base to stay in the hotel . the room is clean , good size , good bed , good shower and the staff are very friendly and the food good , breakfast buffet and service good . Staff very friendly and helpful . We would stay again , but this time .</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"almost all of the staff looked sulky , it was depressing seeing them every time .no basic greetingand they were n't really interested in doing their jobs .the room was filthy and filled with hazardous air .according to the reception , this was supposed to be a non - smoking hotel , but my room and the entire corridor was polluted by guests ' smoking and external smog .it was so horrible that i had to wear a 3 m mask while sleeping at night .stains could be found everywhere in the bathroom .the floor wasso filthy and sticky and internet speed was pathetic as well .quality sleep was n't possible with all sorts of banging noises and conversations from next room .i truly regret staying at this place ,simply the worsti ' ve experienced !i ca n't think of anything good ! </DOC> very standard ibis delivered : small but clean room , private ensuite bathroom and well heated which is by far the most important during the winter months .conveninently located for a short walk to the downtown harbin area with shops , need a cab to the winter wonderland parks . </DOC> great location , good price .friendly front desk staff , especially tina who speaks good english .the bed was as hard as a rock , the floor was not swept properly , strands of long black hair in various spots .the breakfast selection is a joke , do n't bother , just go to starbucks or mcdonald 's nearby to get something .paper thin walls did not help with the noise level .... bring your ear plugs . </DOC> functional more than hospitable , with a good location in the city center , this hotel will likely meet the needs of those looking for a simple and clean place to rest and sleep with a convenient location to tour the city 's top attractions .i got a double room , that came with two small beds , hard mattresses and thin pillows .heating worked fine .bathroom resembled washrooms on airplanes but as matter of fact it did its jobs .for my needs of easy - going tourist , and for the cheap rate that i paid , this hotel worked out just fine . </DOC> this is another cookie - cutter ibis , but i was glad that it was clean , and relatively comfortable .no convenience stores around whatsoever , so finding water , fruits , etc was impossible late at night , besides using the vending machine .wifi is ok in the lobby and awful everywhere else .hard to connect to most websites and impossible for some . </DOC> it is in a good location , nearby to the zhaolin garden where ice lantern festival is held and close to zhong yang main street where most of the restaurants are located .room is spacious and clean .bed is comfy .toilet is ok . </DOC> we stayed here in january when we visited the famous harbin ice and snow festival .location is really good , rooms are basic standard ibis , but clean and warm , very important when it is -25 celsius outside .restaurant is basic but cheap for breakfast , although the food court next door has much more choice available .that said it was excellent value for money . </DOC> cheap and clean basic hotel ; noisy and compact .also , you will hear* everything * through the bathroom door ... there was also noise from the hallway and adjacent rooms at night .as others have mentioned , the beds are quite hard ( and i prefer firmer mattresses ) .staff did not have any maps of the city left and unfortunately did not direct us to the tourist centre a block away near the church which would have been appreciated .on the plus side , the rooms were warm and clean and had everything we needed ( hair dryer , bottled water x 2 every day , body wash , toothbrushes ) ; the water was always nice and hot ; and the hotel is convenient to walking street , sun island , the church , street food , cafes , ktv , etc ."
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'Second time in this hotel with the exception of the reception staff but it is not a luxury accommodation. Staff friendly and helpful , but it is a bit dated with no lift and no lift , no lift and no lift / lift but no lift so no room for one person , no lift , no lift to get to and from the beach , no lift , no lift!</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'the hotel is well spread out and it spotless .the food was good and there was always a good variety .ate the fountain , italian , egyptian and tiran restaurants .our personal favourite was the egyptian one .there are cards on the table in the restaurantsi explained that i found the food bland ( chicken chimichanga )that said we had had a burger there in the day and it was lovely .the rooms are very comfortable but are a little tired and not the same standard as the other sensatorisi asked for the runner on the bed to be removed as it had stains on it and the stool and seat at the bottom of the bed was stained also .the room was n\'t as clean as i would have expected when we arrived but when it was cleaned the next day it was spotless . </DOC> my husband and i have just returned from our second visit to the sensatori - sharm .the service has improved but the fountain ( or canteen as we call it ) could be vastly improved .i mentioned this to the food and bevages manager .i hope the managers do some work with the staff working there .our favourite restaurant is the gokan - fantastic food .but it all a matter of personnal taste .so lovely to have a jacuzzi just a the sun is setting over the red sea - well worth the extra money .( we had 1229 last year ) lovely neighbours in 1229 .we did not go on any excursions this year or saw any of the entertainment </DOC> we were happy with our room and enjoyed the swim up balcony .the hotel is well looked after and the grounds are lovely .the beach is also beautiful and has lots of sunbeds .i think the food was very much hit and miss .the staff serving drinks in the restaurant were lovely and very hard working .this is a lovely hotel butmen have to wear trousers in the evening in the restaurants this was fine for my partner as it was februarythe hotel did send my partner a cake on his birthday which was lovely . </DOC> the hotel is perfectly located , 15 minutes from the airport and right on the beach , with some of the best snorkelling and diving literally at the end of the jetty .all the staff , with one minor exception , were extremely friendly and helpful , and although they were happy to accept a tip there was never any pressure to flash the cash .a number of staff who we did not tip , as we did not see them that often , still provided excellent service .it does of course help to be polite and talk to them , not just click your fingers in their directionthe food was very varied , well cooked and plentiful .my in - laws can be fussy eaters , and this was their first real trip to a " foreign " country ( ie not majorca ) , but they thoroughly enjoyed the buffet meals , especially the live cooking station for pasta , fish and eggs in the morning . </DOC> we have visited egypt several times and always felt a little disappointed with our choice of hotelswe paid extra for two adult swim up rooms and whilst they were fantastici will definitely return to this hotel but probably not bother with the swim up ( for the extra that it costs )we liked all the restaurants but the tiran was our favourite followed by the italian .the buffet was excellent too .the evening entertainment was fab unlike other hotels in sharm .the acts that are flown in from the uk are brilliant but let \'s not forget what a great job the inhouse entertainment team do especially the sensatones .and why do you have to pay for drinks in the payable restaurants ! ! </DOC> the food in the buffet restaurant is ok but if they concentrated on fewer dishes less would be more !food in the other restaurants is good quality .staff attitudes vary from tolerating tourists to being very welcoming .beach drinks can be slow .the fact no one was ill is a testament to the cleanliness of the hotel . </DOC> what makes this hotel stand head and shoulders above the rest , is without a doubt is the staff , from the highest management to everyone behind the scenes , who`s total dedication to ensure you receive the best service possible .. </DOC> lovely room and lovely view .the room cleaner was a nice guy and did a great job .great thought thank you .no problem getting a sunbed unless you want th same spot everyday by the adult pool.. we like to sit outside to eat , the fountain view has an adult area where you can do this .my only downside was the food quality in the main fountain view which i personally thought was very poor and when you order wine they only fill a glass and do not give you a bottle .. the wifi was very good throughout the resort and free which was a bonus .all staff friendly they even printed my boarding passes with a smile .'
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'i was disappointed with the quality of the food and service at the hotel . Staff are very friendly , food and service is excellent , the views from the roof top bar and restaurant were all excellent . we had a room opposite the lake and it was a bit of a journey to get to the city but there were several restaurants within walking distance . Restaurant was good , staff friendly . A little bit of a walk to centre of town but clean</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'the room was a good size ( 2 small doubles and 2 small singles ) , cleaned well each day ( before midday ) .nice balcony with a sea view of sorts .block 15 but sea rather than pool facing .the grounds are stunning - well worth a walk around .i think the resort , whilst large , was well signposted .the buffets meals were varied and the food quality excellent and beautifully themed .the wine / bar waiters are attentive and friendly ( take the time to have a chat to them and your glass will never be empty ) .we also went to the egyptian and thai restuarants which were super , the carefully controlled numbers resulted in an exclusive feel and lovely atmosphere . </DOC> a wonderful combination of relaxation , great food / drink , and evening entertainment .spent our days lazing around the relax pool ... we did have to get there pretty early to get the best sunbeds , but this worked fine for us as we \'d have a mid - morning doze there every morning .loved the food options at all of the restaurants , something for everone ( and no sign of a dodgy tummy for any of us ) .staff at eagles lounge are the best ... would return there just to see them again .best cocktails ever .evening entertainment in the main square was always fun ( and the daughter could catch up on social media as wifi is available there ) , shows at the ampitheatre were pretty dire ( more suitable for children i guess ) .the atmosphere was great ... beware the drinks are stronger there </DOC> but that just adds to the holiday - if modern bathrooms are important to you stay at a far more expensive holidayand it \'s terrific value .the food is excellent with an incredible range available and it simply beggars belief that it sometimes attracts criticism .if you want a range of cuisine the food is superbthe 3 a la carte restaurants are all terrific and the thai is really authentic - the indian / thai restaurant share the restaurant and you have to opt for which one you want when you order the day before .complaints about sun beds should really be about the dopey individuals who feel it important to own one - when there is such a beautiful beach and beach bar available they are welcome to it . </DOC> i \' m afraid that , despite all the good things this hotel offers , the rooms are definitely below par and need a serious refurbishment .our " junior suite with sea view " looked out over a building site ( half - finished private villas ) with the sea in the distance .very tired decor , inadequate bathroom and the sitting area looked like a railway carriage .i \' m afraid i could n\'t cope with it and got the travel rep to move us to another hotel .the aircon was so loud i had to use ear plugs and even with them ini could n\'t blot out the plane noise .if a luxurious room is what you \'re after , avoid this hotel .this was our fifth trip to the red sea and the worst hotel room yet . </DOC> however , that did not spoil what turned out to be a great hotel .the accommodation was fine with a sea view ( extra cost ) and conveniently situated next to the main pool .temperature was great with a nice breeze off the sea to keep you cool and the pool was slightly cool but refreshing .the food and service were excellent .we also tried the thai and mediterranean restaurants at no extra cost with full service .both were excellent .all the waiting staff werefriendly , efficient spoke good english .even the evening entertainment was surprisingly good although we did give the bingo a miss .everywhere was kept immaculately clean and the large team of gardeners have created an oasis in the desert . </DOC> great hotel , very clean, the staff work very hard to keep everything flowing smoothly .plenty of sunbeds 2 pools and directly on the beach ideal for snorkeling .2 long jettys to dive into the warm sea .our room was fine 21119but they are ready for some small . interior upgrading , nothing serious as everything worked well just the odd grouting in the bathroomall the food was excellent .we have been to sharm 4 times and this was the best hotel by far .keep up the good work .the proud family . </DOC> stayed in block 21 , bedroom was acceptable , beds comfortable but maybe too firm for some guests .the bathroom was a little shabby as were the towels .i was surprised that none of the reviews i read mentioned the aircraft noise .now the good stuff !the staff at this hotel were excellent , good fun and helpfull .we were all inclusive , excellent value for money .the food was excellent , my wife has a delicate stomach , neither of us had any problems with tummy upsets .make good use of the a la carte restaraunts , you have to queue to book them but its worth it ..we clebrated my wifes bithday in style , the waiters sang happy birthday and presented her with a birthday cake .the hotel gardens are well kept and immaculate .the hotel is one of the cleanest that we have stayed at . </DOC> firstly all the positive reviews about this hotel are completely bang on , the location , on the best part of the beach with the nicest coral reef to swim around nice jetty to walk out on and life guards- a prom to walk along to the other hotels .hotel is set out over beautifully kept grounds , pools and room blocks .the staff are run by what i can imagine is an excellent management team , always around to take drink orders , refill and clear away plates .wherever you walked staff always smiled and spoke to us !mostly freshly cooked excellent choice , everything you could possibly want we really enjoyed the meals and drinks provided .'
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'Love the Spa with a large pool and hot tub. the staff are very friendly and helpful ,the food was excellent and the hotel restaurant is a good alternative to other restaurants in town - but they have it all about the same as last time . A little bit pricey but worth it for a room with a view over the sea. Hotel is close to city centre but no road noise from outside as it was raining & did not have any noise from other guests. but not a big deal as many guests stayed in their deluxe rooms with no food & drinks & breakfast was a little disappointing</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'the hotel is located close to marine drive of port blair .the room on 4 , 5 & 6 floor have very good view of the sea .but there is lot of scope of improvement in terms of cleanliness and service .the toilet seat was very old and had lots of parmanent marks on it .tv is old style 21 " flat tv .the cable reception is poor as no dth is available in port blair .hotel has a resturant located in basement .serves b\'fast which has 1 - 2 - 3 options .the service is very average .dinner and lucnh are alacart if the occupancy is low .hotel has a bar with a pool table .small swimming pool is fuctional and is cleaned regularly .all in all a very average hotel </DOC> views from the porch , by far the best thing about the hotel .. sounds of waved stashing in just makes it perfect .-location- there is no other major hotel within the city of port blair , most are some distance away , with sinclair everything in the town is walkable .but ok , most guys were willing to help ... bad over priced , but in the context well can live with it ..bathrooms / rooms / staircase / corridors / structure .. everything can be made again ...rates being offered for city tours / transport- marked up big time- </DOC> this was an amazing experience to stay at sinclair .the staff was really friendly and almost felt like family .general manager debanshu andchef sabyasachi were absolulely the best .every evening the kitchen prepared special meals from scratch for us .i would go back there in a heartbeat .this was really a home away from home with a million dollar view . </DOC> lack of choice of hotels forced us to choose this property .we were a group of 13 friends visiting port blair .the hotel is pretty average , very old and run down property .no fresh investments happening into this hotel .location is fantastic , accommodating staff and decent food is one of the pluses of the property .on the other side hotel quality is poor old with stain marks on ceilings and walls .stinking common toilets near the lobby was a complete put off .net net very average hotel . could be considered because of lack choices . </DOC> rooms are good but not maintained .the view from room is a nice rocky beach .food is decent .actually , there is nothing much to do at this hotel .i think it is better to stay at another similar hotels in city which are available much cheaper , are more clean and services are better and then , enjoy the site seeing in port blair . </DOC> we stayed for 1 night and its a good hotel .the food is good and the staff are helpful .i needed a cab and the guys on the desk called about 10 numbers to get me one .i think these things make the stay nice .rooms were massive .the only drawback is internet is only in the lounge area . </DOC> me and my friends had been to port blair last week and we had a great time in andaman and nicobar island .as it was our first visit , we wanted to stay at multiple hotels to understand the hospitality , service and pleasure .first two days , we stayed at a very economical resort near corbyn cove beach then we moved to sinclair hotel .we were truly smitten by service .sinclair in my view is the best place to stay in port blair .it offers great comforts , beautiful sea view and romantic ambiance .my recommendation , go for it . </DOC> the hotel is somewhat run down with seemingly one wing under construction .the restaurant has an unappetising aspect with stained tablecloths and a somewhat institutional buffet ( although the waiting staff were excellent , perhaps the only professional we met at the hotel ) .the management seemed to define the difference between the hotel business and the hospitality business , they really seemed to want to take advantage of the tourists stranded by the cyclone .the rooms are extremely basic and we were shocked at the price charged for a run down room without a / c or a sea view .'
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'On the last minute I was looking for a good hotel with great views and the staff are very nice. Room is average with all the old style and no lift which is not the case with the rooms , we were told to stay in one of the main building which we took advantage of but was told that it was not busy and no water so we called it to be told that it was not buffet food but no fresh fruit</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"the rooms are lavish and big with very nice bed however the food for in room dining is very disappointing and not what you expect from a 5 star property . although they apologised and changed our dish , but the food overall was bland and disappointing . </DOC> the check in was smooth .the room was clean and spacious .overall the staff is proactive and makes you feel at home .the buffet breakfast is a good spread .special mention of kailash at the restaurant for looking after us well .the hotel is located in the center of gurgaon with good connectivity .a very good taj experience ...... </DOC> though this hotel was on the main road at gurgaon area , it was still very quiet in the room and had a fantastic sleep without any disturbance .the hotel is nice and its staff were very friendly .trendy room , attached bathroom and its amenities .great breakfast with a great selection of indian and continental food .the hotel has nice swimming pool , gym , spa , open terrace bar , thai and indian restaurants - appreciated all .not really a nice location for holiday but good for business trip .the nearest place for finding food outside the hotel was at huda city metro station - a food court with good selection of indian food , including fast food .no other shopping opportunities in this area .the closest shopping area is at mg road , which is just 10 minutes by tuktuk and takes about 100 rs max . </DOC> a relatively new property with a neat and sleek architecture .like all the taj properties , you can expect top of the class service and perfect rooms .the breakfast as usual is a highlight .we loved the stuffed freshly made \xe2\x80\x9c gobi ke parathe \xe2\x80\x99we are going to make this a stop again . </DOC> i stayed at this hotel in february and had a great stay .i stayed again in august and was shocked when i went to the bar and the staff remembered me by name !kudos to the bar staff for making a huge difference on my business trip . </DOC> myself and my family enjoyed the property , stay , food and above all the exquisite hospitality .the superior rooms which are base category rooms are quite large and have a wonderful washroom with all required top of the line amenities .the latitude restaurant according to me is one of the finest coffee shops .the rhythm lounge on the 10th floor is a nice outing for evening drinks .my score 7/10 .overall it is a wonderful property to stay . </DOC> in the hustle bustle of gurgaon , this place provides you with lot of opportunities to relax and be fresh for your next meetings .the staff isextremely courteous and food options are great .you expect and get everything for which a taj brand is associated with .when you enter and leave this placeyou do n't get the feel of getting in a taj property , maybe it is bang opposite to a busy road and metro .but once inside you can feel the bliss . </DOC> vivanta by taj in delhi ( gurgoan ) is a lovely hotel with professionals and marvelous services .it 's about half an hour drive from the airport .also connected by metro in delhi .the rooms are awesome and the spa is nice .lovely area with wonderful staff ..."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'first there is no concierge services .you reach the hotel and have to take your own bags out of the vehicle .we were allocated a room which had a pungent smell ....thankfully it was immediately changed .the hotel information book in the room had cartoons drawn in it by pencil .the upholstery certainly needs a change .had a simple a la carte lunch at eatery , was a decent meal .had buffet breakfast at eatery the next morning which left much desired in way of service(tables not laid out , used cutlery on tables , no napkins ..... ) .the " wow " we had experienced at four points visakhapatnam was certainly missing ..... </DOC> nice cozy rooms , hotel staff extremely polite & amazing hospitality , free wi - fi , all basic services, nice buffet break fast with variety of food , they have fitness center ; location is amazing very near to airport , equipped with very good restaurant </DOC> it is good business hotels with good services .food is okand yes some issues with room stay , though the rooms are good enough some issues are there in operations .location is not good as it is far from city , with this tariff you may get many equavalent hotels within the city . </DOC> my phone battery was dead and the hotel guys did nt give me wake up call at requested time .i was given packed fruits as breakfast just in a paper box ( without keeping it in a carry bag )it was not possible for me to handle it ( what a unprofessional way of treating a guest )person on duty put it in a comfortable bag only after requesting 3 times .it seems the hotel does n\'t invest on hiring professional staff and training them .room was good ( as expected ) . </DOC> the hotel is situated on nagar road which is where most of the new hotels are situated in pune .close to the airport .the structure is huge and spacious .check in was a breeze .its quite a dumb rule as per me and is just a shady way to get people to book via the hotel websites at a higher rate .this was brought to the notice of the front office staff , they quickly made amends and alloted us a room in a different floor .no problems here .the room is well appointed as expected along the lines of a starwood hotel and is no way less than a 5 star hotel \' room . </DOC> i stayed here for 3 days and had a great time here .the room is not too big but good for two , and the interior also good , they maintain the room very good , the furniture , the bed the linen .. all good .the staff are all very friendly , they always try their best to give you a smile and talk to you , from the bellboy up to the manager .the bathroom also ok , standard amenities butthe bathroom was clean .and then i talked to the manager </DOC> i had stayed in this hotel in april\'12 for two nights during a business trip .this is nowhere close to a sheraton hotel .the body lotions kept in restroom had expired 8 months ago .- basic articles like dental kit , shaving kit , laundry bags are not offered .surprisingly , when i asked the housekeeping boy and to his superior they just shrugged it off ! -in breakfast they served fried rice , biryani \'s kind of stuffs .atleast am more habituated of consuming such items in lunch or in dinner .- khaman - dhoklas were soft the first day and they suddenly become hard and blackish the next day .i tend to believe that they were re - used and stale . </DOC> when i say well locatedi mean it \'s located well for getting to other sites , landmarks , markets .like nearly all hotels in in bangaloreit \'s on a main dusty road .very clean bedding is good quality , rooms feel very clean , the aircon works well , the outdoor pool is one of the cleanestthe gym is great , big and very well equipped with a mass of machines and free weights .very clean and very nice staff staff there in general were exceptional , and really polite , in particular mukesh patil .he was a gentleman and very professional in his manner and assistance and for that alone , as a tour manager , i would book here again with hesitation .do n\'t be afraid to walk out to the main road and flag down a tuktuk .'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"i am impressed by the views offered from any place facing the indian ocean .suparta is bringing on daily basis an excellent supportand i hope it could access at a better position like duty manager or other promotion in your organisation .only 1 negative point is the gayo coffee which is bitter and really not good taste for espresso lovers great to be here until aug 4th . </DOC> the property is a little old and showing some signs of wear and tear but the staff were perfect , so hospitable and no request was too much for them .we will definitely return if we have to stay in nusa dua in future .the food at the balinese restaurant was really good .the pools and slides were nice for the kids as well as the kids club activities . </DOC> we stayed for one night before moving onto a different location in bali .smooth and efficient and hotel staff could not be more pleasant or welcoming .our room in the tower overlooked the pool area with great views of the beach .the room was large and clean and found the bed comfortable .the bathroom was perfect with both shower and bath .unfortunately due to jetlag we did n't get to enjoy the amenities but we did have dinner in their italian restaurant which was fine .just a couple of minor things that stops me giving the hotel 5 , although we slept in late ( still in london time ! ) , we could hear the noise from the pool area coming through in the morning .also , location is a bit out of the waybe great if you are travelling with children though . </DOC> lovely open reception area with stunning views down to the beach .spacious modern rooms with balcony , large bathrooms with bath and showerand again pretty views over the garden area .staff are friendly and efficient .thoroughly enjoyed the restaurant down on the beach , the food was lovely and the staff excellent !the beach is stunning !however , the pool was disappointing , the pool tiles were being replaced during our stay and there were several cages in the pool with 3 to 4 workmen working during the day .the breakfast restaurant was very busy every day and felt more canteen style than 5 star , however , there were a lot of tour groups at the hotel during our stay . </DOC> very large 5 stars beach front resort located 30 minutes from the airport .rooms are spacey and well equipped , the best are sea view rooms in cliff tower wing .buffet breakfast ( asian and international ) is good , just selection of cheese is surprisingly poor .wifi free , but you have to restart it again and again .staff is very well trained , always smiling and helpful .the neighbouring construction site is sometimes quite noisy .2 ) some people could find this resort too big and might prefer a smaller hotel with more privacy . </DOC> this is a beautiful hotel on the side of a cliff in beautiful bali !beautiful beach area with a great breakfast buffet , pool area , bars and restaurants .and they were beyond accommodating to our large group .would recommend and stay again . </DOC> stayed here for two weeks with the family , fabulous location with amazing views .booked two suites on the 11th floor for the family , fantastic rooms with great views .the spa is epic , massage every other day .the plus point is the service , the staff are amazing ( genuinely mean that ) at all levels with no exceptions .a hotel that genuinely has the customers best interests at heart .thanks again for a great family holiday </DOC> we had a nice stay but some things could be improved .- room : we booked a standard room originally but were upgraded to a renovated ocean view tower room .it was brand new and looking very contemporary , finished to a reasonably high standard .we really liked it a lot , views were of course stunning !- location : the resort is located on a cliff , quiet isolated .a beautiful location actuallybut there is nothing within walking distance .- staff was very friendly throughout , helpful and service - minded .- breakfast ( temporarily served in a conference hall near the entrance of the resort but still with the possibility to eat outside ) ."
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'Threading is a great resort with the location of the hotel , rooms are spacious and well appointed with all amenities you would expect from a resort . Food in the restaurant was ok , staff were friendly and helpful , good staff , pool and gym was well looked after and the staff were very helpful . All in all a good place to stay but would recommend</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEW:  b'rooms are great , good size , large bathrooms , reasonably well kept , balconies all very good ; the main issue with this resort is its location ; its on the back blocks of nusa dua ( beach access via shuttle buses ) which basically makes it feel like you are in an apartment building ( most are ) anywhere in the world .the pool was crowded and warm ( not very refreshing ) and the breakfast buffet was packed and felt like a zoo .accor manage some lovely hotels in bali , unless you have an amazing rate for this property , try its other offerings .</DOC>'

level lagoon pool , backed by the pool bar ( also known as blue bar ) , the restaurant , kids club , spa and gallery .the airport pick - up is well worth organising in advance , the driver has a chilled fresh - smelling towel and cold bottle of water waiting for you !it takes around 20 - 30 minutes to transfer to the resort .there 's no separate concierge desk / service but the front desk staff always knew the answers .generally speaking the standard of decoration and furnishing in the accommodation is pretty high and very pleasant .dark woods ( including floors ) and subtle lighting , citrus coloured cushions and art on the walls and in corners . </DOC> had a weekend break in novotel nusa dua . stayed in a two bedroom suite which was very spacious and reasonably priced .i will start with the positive sides .the pool area is very nice especially if you are travelling with really small children .the suite was nice and spacious .the hotel forgot to pick us up at the airport .and they sent a car .not a very good first impression .no compensation was offered not even an excuse .restaurant is really bad .service takes forever , food is not tasty and prices are not really competitive .unfortunately the resort is a bit isolated so you do not have any nearby options .it is not a beach front resort and not really walking distance either .you need to take a shuttle to get there .not so convenient .in all this resort is ok but we will go for another option next time . </DOC> we loved the kids movies at 6.30pm adjacent to the restaurant , meant we could eat in peace while the kids watched the movie - also got us in that restaurant a bit more !the new kids swimming session with kids club at 10 am was popular with our kids .the beach club has changed and while the bus and approach are better , its very hot at the caf\xc3\xa9 as its quite far back from the breeze .fans would be goodthe kids club as ever was great , the staff are so lovely and genuinely lovekids special thanks to ayu , wati , chips and thomas .i always enjoy the fitness sessions inc . yoga , stretching , and aqua gede , ari , and the others do a great job .great convenience with the on site bakery , convenience store , atm and cheap laundry across the road . already working out when we can come back . </DOC> we spent our honeymoon in novotel nusa dua .the hotel is situated in a beautiful part of bali , very close to the beach( transport to the beach every 15 - 20 mins ) .the service was immaculate , you could n't ask for more !everyone was always smiling and going out of their way to help us .we had a fantastic time at this hoteland i would recommend it to everyone . </DOC> living room is spacious , enough sofa for everyone to sit and spend time .the kids club staff was so friendly .we joined the pool volley ball game , it was fun .the staff was able to make groups of strangers can feel relax and having fun .the format of the restaurant is like open wall , so i can see bird under the ceiling and a bit worry if any dirt from the bird will contaminate the food .lobby was not impressive .small and a bit dark .free shuttle bus available to go to bali connection , a place of shopping and restaurant nearby .hotel private beach is located 10 min walk and a shuttle bus run from hotel to beach every 15min .spa is nice .not over - charged , clean , relaxing and at the end of the day 9 - 11 pmthey give you 25 % discount for spa service . </DOC> the kids club is great and since free it 's so easy to go for an hour here and there and give us a break .the ladies there are great especially sri and novi .the morning walks , stretching , and aquaare great too good job arsa , aragon , and puja .love the onside bakery , the kids enjoy the wednesday dance show and the spa rocks at $ 30 for an online booking for massageit 's great value .love the apartment rooms great for feeding fussy kids . </DOC> let me start by saying that i really like nusa dua as a holiday destination .it is much quieter and cleaner than kuta / legian and no goateed , tattooed , west coast eagles jumper wearing yobbos .we had a 2 br unit on the 4th floor of building 5 .the building faced the outside of the complex, such is the thickness of the trees .the room was massive !both bedrooms were massive , the main bathroom was massive ...each bedroom and the lounge had large flat panel tvs with lots of cable channels to choose from .probably the only downside was the comfort of the lounge .it was like knotted cane / wicker andthe backrest was very uncomfortable ."

SUMMARY:  b'Threading is a good Holiday Inn , clean and well appointed with the staff all around , the staff were friendly and helpful . the room was very spacious , the restaurant was full of golfers but they have a lot of restaurants . food and service are all excellent . Stayed in room 3. staff were friendly and helpful . the only thing we found was that this time the hotel was full of weddings and a bit annoying. Would not stay here again , just not worth the money. would not stay here again . Probably not worth the money</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"love this hotel , especially for the bed , it is very comfortable .the style of this property is resort , hence it makes your stay enjoyable ... also my room is with garden accessso it was perfect to enjoy afternoon tea beside the garden .breakfast was also good with plenty of choices . </DOC> sheraton bandung have 2 types of building , the main building and the tower building .the room interior is more modern , comparing classic one prior renovation .the new layout provide big empty space behind the door that i think is not efficient .bathroom have modern bathtub and good layout of shower cubicle .bed is very convenient .amenities is complete . </DOC> got the airport transfer from the hotel which is about 165 k idr from the airport to hotel which is about 30 - 40mins ride .the room is really huge and comfortable .and i was a light sleeper but got used to it and slept through it .traveling to lembang area i booked a local transport with drive for 600 k idr exclude driver meal 50 k , parking , entrance fee .traveling within bandung is convenient using either grab or uber .the food however can be improved to make it warm especially the bbq station which already precooked the food and was really hard and cold .they could bbq outdoor fresh and hot and will make the bbq more tasty . </DOC> i love how the hotel says hello , how the receptionists make me feel great , being polite and friendly .the food here is also amazing , </DOC> the room was spacious , luxury , clean and very well equipped .the bed and pillows were very comfortable .it serves variety of breakfast choice and the taste was good . </DOC> stayed here on business in march and was impressed by the staff and the renovations .i did n't have a pool facing room , which would have been very nice .the rooms are light and airy and it definitely has a ' resort feel ' , which is great when you 're travelling on business .breakfast was ok and the location is good .i understand that the hotel must recover its cost , but wow ! certainly left a bad taste in my mouth and made the duty free guy at the airport happy that i purchased a new charger there for $ us25 . </DOC> services are great from greeting to check out , worth of a 5 stars recognition .definitely one of bandung 's best high - end accommodation .truly recommended especially to an elite spg members . </DOC> the staff is very friendly and attentive .even though is it located at the busy dago street , the rooms are quiet and we enjoyed our relaxing short getaway there .pool is nice and very clean too though get a bit too crowded after a while .the only negative comment is about the dining are at the tower building .there are lots of flies and bugs that visited the food and the variation is limited .we should be allowed to have breakfast to the main dining room as well since there are more people dining there ( means they keep adding new fresh food ) and a lot more variations ."

SUMMARY:  b"Visited the hotel for business with my wife and it was excellent value for money. the rooms are large and well appointed , good wifi and the free wifi is very good as is the gym . we are very happy with this hotel and it's a great place to spend a night in the area</DOC>"

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"the welcome was warm .the public areas elegant but felt very comfortable .loads of different places to sit and relax .4 poster style bed , large room ,i ' ve ever seen , a small private terrace overlooking the courtyard and a very large front terrace shared with the admirals suite next door .the hotel has a central courtyard where you can choose to eat mealsor you can seek the air conditioned sanctuary of the dining room .after dinner we chose to sit in the stylish bar / lounge area on the rear side of the courtyard .there is a lovely swimming pool .watch out for the monkeys playing in the trees at the back whilst you swim . also keep an eye open for the pet rabbit who wanders around .all the staff from the moment we arrived to the moment we left were attentive and friendly .they made our stay special . </DOC> the idea was for us to have the admiral , my son and his wife to have the captain , and my daughter and friend to be in the crawford .but as it turned out the two suites are upstairs above the entrance lobby area of the hotel andall the crawford are downstairs around the gardenbut this was possible because the crawford which is their standard rooms are large and lovely ! !the suites are decadent !the breakfast served in the room was delightful , a choice of srilankan or european .both were good , portions not very large , but you could ask for refills ( srilankan ) .room decor was nice and very fitting with entire heritage theme and setting of the place , very serene , peaceful and charming .luxury , yes , just enough , which is very nice in my opinion . </DOC> we stayed at tamarind hill for 3 nights and were so pleased we found this small boutique hotel , which has a lot of interesting history .on arrival we were very warmly welcomed by kasuni who after processing our paperwork gave us a guided tour of the hotel and its facilities before showing us to our room .the hotel lies a short distance from the main town and galle fort but the beach and the small turtle hatchery are within walking distance .the service we received was to a very high standard as was everything about this charming hotel .we will certainly stay here again when we return to galle . </DOC> possibly not ideal with young kids , but very comfortable , relaxingstay in peaceful surroundings .a decent sized pool and very comfortable sizeable rooms with big bathrooms .the breakfast was a la carte and absolutely delicious with a western and local option . </DOC> we were staying nearby at jetwing lighthouse and went here for dinner .the hotel is amazing - a gorgeous colonial house which has been beautifully maintained and furnished .the staff are most attentive and hospitable .it is very beautiful and peaceful .the food is mainly seafood with some good salads .the prawns were very good and the homemade bread was the best bread tasted so far on this trip . </DOC> the added building has 10 rooms , so it is a very small boutique hotel .i was in the captain 's suite in the main building .the room was huge with a 4 poster bed and some antique furniture .the bathroom is enormous and is located on what was once the porchthere is also a small terrace area off the bathroom as well as part of the terrace on the back of building which mostly belongs to the admiral suite .breakfast very good .there 's really nothing to complain about with this place .they ' ve done a beautiful job turning the building into a hotel with all of the mod - cons . </DOC> first of all i have to tell that i am fallen in love with this wonderful place .i was mesmerized by its quality & architectural beauty .it was the best suite we have been so far .the whole hotel is picturesque .they are very very helpful & full of cheer .sithara & gayan gave us an unforgettable service .i was truly amazed of the super quality of service .lakmal , the chef pampered us with mouth watering delicacies .i must say he was absolutely successful .i saw a smile on each guest 's face @ the hotel .i realised that not only me , everyone is fully satisfied @ this place . </DOC> this is an exquisite hotel set around 15 mins tuk tuk ride from galle .it is tranquil and restful .the rooms are great and the pool was just fabulous , no chlorine water from the well .the staff were so helpful , but it has to be said a little slow on occasions !but the pace of life was pretty slow all round .the food was good , the egg 's benedict was much better than the omelette !wonderful mixture of wildlife and pets in the garden including a wild peacock and pet rabbits ."

SUMMARY:  b'Threading is a very nice hotel situated in the heart of the city . the rooms are spacious and very comfortable with a good central location with good food and drink . Breakfast was the best holiday so far from different countries . Staff were friendly and helpful . I had to wait for the staff to be sorted and there was no bar and no tea/coffee making facilities etc . the staff were not helpful . Would not stay again , but did have to change the waitress</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEW:  b"we spent two nights here while visiting turkey recently , to see pamakkule and hieropolis ( which is worth two days , in my humble opinion , since the ruins are so extensive and beautiful ) .this hotel feels like a beautifully little oasis in a very rustic , charming area .it 's within walking distance of pamakkule , which i loved since we saw it at sunset .the big win for this hotel is how stunning its outdoor patio is , with great food and a lot of beauty , swarming with fireflies at night on a very lush grounds .the staff is friendly but not overly assuming , although the young guy who works the desk is friendly .it was small , so i would n't have wanted to stay for more than our two nights , although the bathroom was good and larger .breakfast was quite tasty .the price was just right .</DOC>"

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"we spent two nights here while visiting turkey recently , to see pamakkule and hieropolis ( which is worth two days , in my humble opinion , since the ruins are so extensive and beautiful ) .this hotel feels like a beautifully little oasis in a very rustic , charming area .it 's within walking distance of pamakkule , which i loved since we saw it at sunset .the big win for this hotel is how stunning its outdoor patio is , with great food and a lot of beauty , swarming with fireflies at night on a very lush grounds .the staff is friendly but not overly assuming , although the young guy who works the desk is friendly .it was small , so i would n't have wanted to stay for more than our two nights , although the bathroom was good and larger .breakfast was quite tasty .the price was just right . </DOC> the room was comfortable and had a balcony .the bathroom is badly overdue for an upgrade .very aware of other guests and noise .staff very helpful and friendly .we ate there our first evening and the food was very average . </DOC> this hotel is located in 10 mins walking distance from the thermal pool visit .family operated and cozy .the room size perfect on size .dinner was simple but wonderful .two pools were in a good size and clean .parking spot were available along side the hotel . </DOC> the room was immaculately clean upon arrival and housekeeping keeps it that way throughout your stay .there are two indoor lounge areas as well as a lovely outdoor garden complete with a swimming pool .the hotel is within easy walking distance of the travertines .the meals are home cooked by ibrahim \xe2\x80\x99s mother and are delicious \xe2\x80\x93her tomato soup is to die for !the most memorable part of my three day stay at the venus hotelwas the hospitality of ibrahim and karyni understand why lonely planet rates it their # 1 hotel in pamukkale . </DOC> the good : helpful front desk service with good english .very comfortable and suitably quirky caravansary - esque common areas with a pleasant swimming pool / courtyard separating the venus twins .the included wifi worked ok but the connection was very slow at times .there is on - street parking at or near front of hotel .an extensive and satisfactory breakfast buffet taken in the courtyard / pool area is included .the attached venus restaurant serves good food with amiable service in a pleasant covered courtyard environment .all in all it was good value for the room tariff .the hotel offers a free shuttle service to the south gate of the antiquities and travertine precinct .the not so good : the immediate surroundings are less than salubrious but then that argument could be made of the entire town .the standard guest rooms are , well , compact . </DOC> as we arrived in the village and slowed the car to analyse where our selection of hotels might be , the owner of the venus ( the father ) started harassing us to stay at his place .we moved the car away , but he followed , hollering in the car .it was a very pleasant place .as stated is other reviews , the staff / family is extremely friendly and helpful , the most so in all our stays in turkey .we were in one of the rooms in the new wing , so it was very clean , new , and bright .the meals were also quite good . </DOC> eight kinds of olives ! !, numerous housemade jams , including rose , and the usual turkish fare in addition to french toast i highly recommend putting the honey with almonds on the toast ! and the price was unbelievably low- best value of all the places we stayed at in our three week trip highly recommended </DOC> from our side window on the 3th floor we could look at the white mountains and terraces of pamukkale , only a 10 minutes walk away from the hotel .venus hotel is located in the middle of the village .away from the tourist buses and all the hassle .family run hotel and friendly staff .nice restaurant with a good selection of local wines ."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"the staybridge suites was excellent .very large rooms with all amenities of home .the staff was friendly and the lobby warm and inviting .the breakfast and social hour at night were great and well stocked .. truly a relaxing stay . </DOC> spent 7 nights while in town for a family reunion and rolling stones concert .the rooms were separated by a nice living room and kitchenette .this separation was great for privacy and adults and kids had their own space .beds were very comfortable and there was plenty of drawer and closet space .the lobby area includes a lovely breakfast each morning and manager 's reception on certain weeknights .there is also a very nice outdoor sitting area with two gas grills and a fireplace .this outdoor area connects to the indoor pool area .and on the day of and following the rolling stones concert , the hotel put out a beautiful spread of rolling stones themed cupcakes .the neatest part of this extended stay hotel is free laundry ! !no feeding the machines with quarter after quarter . </DOC> absolutely stellar stay .the property is brand new , all the lights in the hotels are energy efficient ( idle off ) , the rooms are super clean and modern , electrical outlets - a - plenty , location is great ( 25 min to niagara , 10 min to downtown ) , area is clean and safe , breakfast is really good , and in the immediate area there are several restaurants .if i ever come back to buffalo or niagara , this is where i am staying . </DOC> i have to say that we scored a very nice room and a decent view of the area .during our time there , we experienced a free manager 's happy hour featuring some lite nosh and beer / wine / soda .beds were very nice and the room could not be cleaner .overall , it was impressive .breakfast was included and had a good choice since they had to cater to many people .parking is right out in front and seemed to be a very safe area .my only quibble was that at the time we paid $ 188 for the night and we felt that there are similar places in the buffalo area that may be more reasonable . </DOC> hotel was clean and in good repair location was reasonable for the area , we had a two bedroom suite which was excellent , a great room for families , internet was solid linens were in good repair , the kitchen had the standard items which was nice , fitness area a little smaller than some but was not busy when i was there </DOC> truth be told , i thought i had booked a different brand for this business trip to the buffalo area .what i got was a pleasant treat .the staff was very friendly and helpful , this included recommendations for places to go to in town .this included a great local grocery store !everything was very clean and nice .the pool , gym and laundry all were pleasant .the room had a nice layout .the bed was the right balance of firm and giving .there was virtually no noise from the other rooms and none from the outside .the only downside here was the free breakfast ...everything else about the breakfast was very nice .again this hotel was a very pleasant treat andwell worth the money ! </DOC> my partner and i were on a road trip .tired and hungry check in was quick .staff very friendly and welcoming .rooms decent size and a bath . spotless and clean .this hotel has complimentary tea , coffee .laundry , internet access .o lovely lounge and great outdoor seating area .it also had a fitness centre .we dropped our cases off and headed out .i know this has nothing to do with hotelbut if you are looking for food check out the blue bull tavern . will recommend this hotel t family and friends . </DOC> check in person was polite and helpful .nice hotel with very nice rooms .free breakfast was very good despite the lack of any breakfast meat .also the right elevator was very slow .overall would definitely recommend this hotel ."
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'Been here for business and had a very good stay with the same standard as the other motels and other hotels in town. Room was very clean and spacious with a nice bed. Nice staff , only downside was that it is only a few minutes walk to the main city so you can walk to most of the city but you have to walk to all the main sites and shops are within walking distance . Staff are friendly & helpful</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"the hotel 's location is probably one of the best ones in the town of byblos .it overlooks the sea and is within 5 minutes walk to the main market and the citadel .staff were helpful and breakfast was nice and traditional ( although variety can be improved there ) .overall it was a nice experience and would do it again . </DOC> i really recommend this hotel to families who seek a quiet place across the sea and not like crowded , club oriented jounieh in lebanon .the rooms are large with comfortable beds and awesome view .i suggest the hotel owners to add a rolling curtain to shower window to make it more comfortable for a family who use the room together . </DOC> an absolute must visit when in beirut .rather than taking a taxi i would highly recommend a tour through nakhlah tours .for just a few dollars moreyou get the beautiful coach ride picked up from your hotel or location and get multiple sites to visitand it includes your ticket fee in to the tourist site .much better deal .the souks around the area are good and be sure to negotiate .enjoy the history and the scenery and pray for a sunny day ! ! ! </DOC> the room is great , i believe all rooms face the sea if not the majority of them .i had breakfast too , which i do n't usually do , and it was awesome the building has a little old style touch ,two issues you would keep in mind though , they play very loud music by the sea shore all night long then turn it off at 1 am .the other thing is about the location ; unless you like the old city of byblos and would like to visit all these old attractions , do n't stay there for long .the closest mall would be the abc dhbaiehand it 's nothing like the other good outdoor abc near beirut . </DOC> although set in the best part of lebanon - i have to say the hotel while dated lacked personality and soul .there was no welcome and the staff seemed just to go thru the motions .while i was there a wedding was taking place and it took over the pool area and took a full day to get the area back in order .the pool deck and pool is dated andvery unkept.breakfast was poor also ...sorry i am finding it hard to be positive.in a country which needs tourism you have to do better ... refit the hotel ... make a better pool area ....but i will return to byblos . </DOC> lovely hotel set on the sea front just north of the small fishing port .lovely large room with a balcony and a sea view .clean shower room with separate wc and separate wash basin area .huge bed , sofa , tv , kettle , cups , glasses . expensive but worth it . </DOC> we checked - in at 4 o'clock in the morning but the lady at the counter was gracious , polite and very welcoming .we liked the tastefully decorated , spacious room and the very good bathroom .we ordered room service for breakfast the next day and i have to say it was excellent : very good patries choice , excellent egg dish .the beach is n't fantastic but generally speaking the hotel is very well located in the old town of byblos .we will return back ! </DOC> historic hotel recently beautifully renovated .brilliant service , very clean and large rooms , beautiful design and nice sea view in all rooms .breakfast was delicious .this hotel is great for a weekend getaway if you want to stay in byblos with easy access to restaurants and historic sites ."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"very few english channels no dvd player and free library rooms dated and wardrobes fusty no milk in room for teano wifi in rooms which for us was a major disadvantage being away for 5 months and using skype to contact disadvantages for club rooms against tanjung aru : free drinks from 5.30 - 7 , half hour plate of nibbles only in evening , tanjung unlimited high quality snacksno free daily paper delivered to room no balcony at all no free use of pc , printing etc in club lounge club lounge casual , not exclusive appearance go to tanjung aru ! ! </DOC> we booked the school holiday fun package for 3 nights stay and enjoyed the deluxe room with sea view .while we did try the pool at the country club , we left after a few minutes as it was too crowded , so , we decided to swim in the magellan pool instead .during our stay in magellan , we rented a small myvi to drive around kk .so , instead of having breakfast at the five sails ( which some mentioned was crowded with tourist from china and korea ) , we had local breakfast away from the hotel , which was delicious .we manage to get a glimpse of the sun setting during our stay here and it was indeed beautiful sight . </DOC> this was our first time in malaysia , and the purpose of the trip was to see the orang - utans in sebilok .travelbag advised this hotel , and we were not disappointed .our room was of more than adequate size , with lots of storage space .friendly helpful reception .great breakfast variety .i enjoyed cereals , then fish curry and coconut rice !various ethnic restaurants .pool good for kids .my wife says we ought to come back , and bring children and grandchildren . </DOC> one of the best city resort .by the sea , everything is nearby .shuttle bus to kk cityonly rm3 ( payable at the counter ) - but from the city no need to pay anything .as for the room , looks a bit tired n old , but still nice n classy .breakfast was so so , so does lunch . </DOC> this is one of my worst experience of receiving lousy service , lousy product but having to pay a lot for it .the service is non - existent at the lobby lounge .we had to frequently help ourselves , go up to the bar to ask for things to be done .even the bill had to reminded 3 times !please do n't go . </DOC> i stayed in the pacific sutera part of the sutera harbour resort .continuous running shuttle buses between these two properties were a thoughtful and comfortable value addition .the view from my room was awesome .the marine blue of the south china sea dotted with a few islands looked almost like a painting which changes color and mood during different times of the day .the inside facade of the hotel is little unimaginative and simple .but , the room decor is classy .only the tv is outdated and offers only a very few channels .the washroom is neat and nice but the shower cubicle may be too small for a slightly overweight person .the food was nice .over all a very nice and pleasant stay . </DOC> this hotel is only minutes away from the kk airport and along the route to the kk city centre .breakfast selection was good , with a vast range of malaysia and continental spread .what this hotel lacks is the beachfront and the beach atmosphere that kk is known for . </DOC> situated on a golf course with the ocean in front just at the edge of the main downtown area , its a large resort , very nice , big public spaces , rooms are good , ours room 1001 overlooked the front entry and golf course .the pool is very large and good with a small beach beside which was disappointing due to some garbage in the water and on the sand - the management should do better to keep it clean .the ground are large and very nicely maintained gardens .its a 20 minute walk to a large mall ."
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'Been to this hotel for the last 4 years but the room was as it did have been recently refurbished with a small balcony overlooking the bay. A bit of a walk from the beach and other restaurants and bars are good rooms and good food ,and coffee is excellent with a good choice . We ate at the beach for lunch which were good & staff friendly & helpful</DOC>'

SUMMARY:  b'This hotel has the most modern and contemporary decor in the bedrooms are well maintained and the rooms are very comfortable with all the amenities required for one night with free wifi. Staff were friendly and helpful . the only thing that was a problem was that the heater was not working properly and we reported some of the other 2 issues which were not acceptable . Breakfast was ok . Staff very friendly & helpful . Did not eat in the restaurant but it was good but would not recommend</DOC>'

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'Threading is a modern hotel with the most modern rooms that are in need of refurbishment. the hotel is very close to the main train and shopping centre and it has the usual facilities and facilities , nice gym , good wifi , good location , good for a short stay , good breakfast and staff . Good value , and excellent value ! Will recommend</DOC>'

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'Never a bad stay. the staff are very friendly and helpful and the room was a comfortable size with all the amenities you would expect from a budget hotel , good bathroom with a good shower and a very nice bathroom which is the only negative thing I can say about the hotel - they had a little bit of a makeover but the reception was lovely , food was excellent , staff friendly , but the room was very clean , no issues . All in all a good choice</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"the fraser suites in guangzhou is the first hotel of all those we have stayed at over the years and around the world where we can give an almost unreserved rating of excellent in every way .we would like to return to guangzhou and on such an occasion would stay here again if fraser 's hospitality continue the reasonable price , superb accommodation and truly outstanding service .we used the apartment only as a base to go sightseeing , and so did not use other facilities offered by the hotel such as the gym , swimming pool , steam room , sauna or golf simulator .the lobby area was bright , crisp and modernstaff at reception were professional , efficient and pleasant .on seeing the apartment on the 16th floor facing the main street , we noticed the noise of traffic outside entering the bedroom . </DOC> it was a lovely studio apt with all the amenities you need .it is little touches like this that make the guest feel pampered .breakfast was a nice spread of chinese , japanese and western .if you are attending the canton fair , they have 4 daily shuttle to the fair in the morning and 4 return shuttle in the evening .hotel is location surrounded by eateries / restaurants and shopping .this is a good hotel to stay even if you are on vacation . </DOC> it was another very enjoyable stay the second time around . due to the slightly longer check in process , we were upgraded to a larger executive suite .we found the stay truly comfortable , wonderful beds , furnishings and lighting .the bathroom has a panoramic view from the shower and tub .the shower was terrific also .the location ca n't be better , just 3 metro stops from east rail station .breakfast was great , a little crowded at times but services were excellent . </DOC> the location is quite central , close to shopping malls and eateries .but , it was supposed to be fraser suite which i would expect to give a better service at the reception , but the lobby is small and it was at the ground floor .the reception is on the 7th floorother than that , everything is still acceptable ., i quite like fraser concept of 2 units bedroom in 1 apartment , with family room , dining rooms , kitchen and laundry which is very convinient for families to stay . </DOC> the hotel is just opposite of taikoohui , and my room had a good view of the premium shopping mall .the wifi was fast .the bed was comfortable .the toiletry and the breakfast was average .the price was reasonable and staff friendly . </DOC> housekeeping was good .breakfast selection was good .mrt on basement of same building .restaurants and mini market next door .hotel provides free transport for canton fair . will be back again for location and cleanliness . </DOC> well located in tianhe , this hotel is in a very modern building .room are large , very well equipped , very nice bathroom and a alarge kitchen fully equipped .that is ideal for a stay of a few days .breakfast is good but not exceptional .the hotel has no restaurant but there are plenty of themin the street .the acces by car is not always easy , and you cab may leave you about 50 meter from the entrance of the hotel .better know it .the great place in my opinion , if you like to be a bit independant </DOC> the fraser suites is very conveniently located at the heart of tianthe chicest business and shopping area in guangzhou .it is adjacent to a posh shopping arcade called wanlin hui which hosts a variety of stores and restaurants , not to mention a subway station right at the basement .across the street is the taikoo hui - operated by the swire group .our studio was clean and confortable with large fridge , washer and a bar .breakfast quality was good with various types of cuisine .yet often there were noisy families seated at large tables which rendered a peaceful meal impossible .and there were toddlers running around the dining hall without any restraint .perhaps management may consider segregating these family visitors from other hotel guests to enhance civility in the breakfast experience ?"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b"As a platinum member of our family this is the best hotel in the city.Nice location close to the main attractions and restaurants in walking distance . Rooms are spacious and clean . breakfast was good but not great .The bed was hard as it was a bit soft , but with all the facilities they have to keep the shower and tub , it's a shame as there was no lift but the rooms have a few more . Staff helpful</DOC>"

ORIGINAL REVIEW:  b"the hotel is in a great location for walking round guilin 's lakes , into the old town and to the city centre , especially at night when everything is lit up .the lakes are extremely attractive with bridges , walkways and pagodas .the hotel room was large and clean , if a little old fashioned and the walk in shower had seen better days .staff were friendly and helpful .the buffet evening meal was ridiculously cheap compared to other hotels - only 68 yuan per person ( around \xc2\xa3 8.50 ) - and whilst there was n't a huge choice the food was very good for the price .we would recommend this hotel for location alone .</DOC>"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'This hotel has the most beautiful view from the outside area and the rooms are clean and tidy with tea/coffee making facilities. Room was very large and had a nice bathroom , they had tea & coffee making facilities and the usual buffet breakfast was served with plenty of choice of fruit & yoghurt, fruit & yoghurt etc which we used to eat and was very pleased we were not disappointed</DOC>'

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'Our room was comfortable , with a large bed and a very clean bathroom . Breakfast the next morning the hotel is well located for the city centre and they have a good bar in the lobby . Only 5 minutes from airport . We would return but not too much choice . Its not a 5 star but not the worst . Would recommend</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"what a wonderful experience from the start to checking out .service was top - class , attentive and informative .special mention of both sunny and anna who were on duty at the horizon club lounge .wifi connection was speedy .overall a great experience , and worth the price .ask for the horizon club package . </DOC> from the first interaction with angel at the reception desk to our nightly greeting upon our return we felt truly welcome at this hotel .our room was fantastic with a great bed and a nice view of the surrounding cityscape .the shang palace restaurant also provided an excellent meal at a very reasonable price . </DOC> it is about 2 year since i reviewed this hostel last time .it is located in the most busy high tech district so very convenient for most business visitors .it is often crowded with some conferences butthe back of the hotel is a park and golf practice rangeso it is quite quiet in the back garden of the hotel .the room is large and comfortable , the king size bed is super large , the swimming pool located at 3 floor with garden view below is still the best in xi\xe2\x80\x99an of all hotels .the breakfast is still also the best of all hotels in xian </DOC> this hotel is said to be the best in xi'an .rooms are modern and comfortable .staff is friendly and wants to serve well .bath amenities fine .lobby bar area seems popular with a business crowd after work .a very satisfactory place to stay . </DOC> a lovely hotel .nice happy hour there .also , the buffet breakfast selection -- both chinese and western -- was the best of the four shangri - la hotels we stayed at in china .only negative is the hotel 's location . </DOC> this hotel is just a beautiful hotel .really lavish , rich , and luxurious .it is a pretty amazing hotel .surprisingly , it is good , but it 's not great .lots of smoke & mirros with the breakfast display , but it came out as a very solid meal .the breakfast was not over - the - top with great food , unfortunately .the rooms are all phenomenal , no question .i can not comment on the location as others have because we were part of a tour group , so we got shuttled everywhere .but with regards to the hotel itself , it was pretty amazing . </DOC> the staff was cordial , helped us to the best of their english ( and my limited chinese ) ability , breakfast buffet was plentiful and of good quality , rooms large , standard amenities provided in - room , room service menu and response time good , lobby bar atmosphere large and comfortable , and housekeeping always tidied our room up nicely .i would agree with a few recent reviews that the location is n't ideal if you are trying to see xi'an in a very limited amount of time . due to the traffic , it takes approximately 20 - 30 minutes to get inside the inner city walls where the muslim quarter and other popular sight - seeing activities are located .overall , we were happy with our choice for our 3 night stay . </DOC> the hotel is in the new section of xian and is a standared decent quality shangri - la property .my room was average size with a standard set up .the restaurant was nice and the breakfast was better than average wiht freshly made croisants being served by the chef which was a nice touch .otherwise nothing special about this property .i have no complaints but overall the hotel lacks an overall warmth that would make one want to return ."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'no complaints , definitely no complaints .a beautifully located hotel facing the sea and small islands that dot the coast .staff were all impeccable in their approach .rooms were a delight and sleeping was just a pleasure .i really liked where the hotel was situated a mere few minutes from downtown .great boat trips from the pier at the hotel which whisked is to a beautiful island called muiyijama .shrine visit was a magnificent delight .food was excellent </DOC> positive - the location is the best advantage of this hotel... it is just a wonderful location with an amazing view !just perfect - direct access to the ship transfer - free shuttle bus from jr station to the hotel ( 30 minutes by bus ! )- employees were kind and professional negative - most of the employees does not speak english at all .- my room was " non - smoking " , but it was stinky of smoke ! -the room was not clean very well ( for japanese standards ) and the forniture was really old - the bar has an amazing view , however more or less 10 \xe2\x82\xac for a beer is clearly overpriced !overall a perfect location , but from my point of view the service provided was not sufficient . </DOC> this hotel was awesome .specially when you went for breakfast on the 25th floor and see the sun rise and watch the ships sail by .the breakfast spread was also a good one .even the location was good and convenient .a great place to stay .the rooms were clean and the people were polite . </DOC> for those lucky enough to get a sea view - and who like scenic views - this hotel has a lot to offer .it is not near the centre of hiroshima , but its sea - side location has several advantages , notably the fast - boat service to the island of miyajima , one of japan \'s jewels .our room ( 9f ) was adequate , reasonably sized by japanese hotel standards ( but still a bit small for most western travellers ) , but the carpet was stained , as was the corridor carpeting from the elevators ; one of the walls in our room was scuffed .all in all , the hotel should be updated / renovated .though it is common in japanese hotel , i still found it off - putting to be asked to pay a sizeable amount to use their hot spring bath area , even as a hotel guest . </DOC> we stayed here one night as part of a tour of japan and were not made very welcome .we had a room on the 19th floor , a so called upgraded room but was still small with nowhere suitable for two persons luggage .the hotel is a modern highrise conference hotel , triangular in shape at the waterfront outside the city .breakfast was was a good choice of international items . would probably recommend for delegated but not individuals . </DOC> hotel is approximately 40mins from hiroshima train station by taxi , and there is almost no amenities outside the hotel surrounding , although there are a number of good restaurants in the hotel .breakfast view from the 23rd floor is breathtaking .bathroom is quite small but well - equipped .main dissatisfaction is the absence of wifi in the room , and only in the lobby -- which immediately disqualified the prince as a business hotel for me .should you take the tram from the city , the walk from the main road to the hotel is a brisk 20min walk . </DOC> the place is huge with everything you could ask for including great views of the harbor .it is isolated , though . despite the free shuttle and taxis most in my group felt more comfortable staying in and eating at the relatively pricey hotel restaurants . </DOC> we stayed here one night as part of a wendy wu tour , first let me say that we had been to the bomb area andthe hotel is surrounded on three sides by waterso the views are quite amazing .we looked across to the other side of the bay .check in was easy andthe room very nice , clean comfy bed and a large bathroom .we ate dinner and breakfast in the restaurant and experienced some tasty japanese food .there were lost of school tours in as well but there were no problems .'

SUMMARY:  b'Threading is a new hotel in the old town of the city and the hotel has been refurbished. Very nice location with shopping and restaurants on site - there are some good restaurants and shops around the corner. Rooms were very spacious but not as luxurious as other hotels in the UK, room was good but not as good as other rooms . And we visited again with colleagues & they were so helpful</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"its been a while i stayed at this hotel , but the stay was very comfortable and pleasing .very good location and the food spread was nice .the rooms are spacious and are well maintained .i loved the breakfast buffet at the hotel the most .overall a good property ! </DOC> - bad checking in process .only able to check in the room at 6.00pm - giving reason because of high occupancy .err how long have you been in this industry , should already find a way to speed up everything or hv a courtesyperhap a free juices or something .bad experience - staffs should be trained how to treats guestslet the guest feel like there are in a 4 - 5 stars hotel .better service from a 1 star hotel - waited almost like 2 hrs for a razor and a 1 whole night for a bath gel lol- my first bad experiences in what you claims as a 4 - 5 stars hotel - rate 1 star just for their huge room , pool and location - and please do nt give reason* room not availble because of too many guest* that s not what i want to know . </DOC> big apartment style room .breakfast is great .lobby is lovely , as is the pool area .shopping centre has pretty much everything you meed , including a rollercoaster :-)staff and management are very efficient , professional and friendly a few minor improvements are needed in my opinion .gym is ok , albeit a little dated .no clock in the room ( an alarm clock would be brilliant ) .also some bedside drawers would be nicewould definitely consider staying here again . </DOC> the berjaya 's location , nestled inside the times square mall , is pretty much perfect for everything .shopping , relaxation , nightlife are all conveniently located to the hotel .only tried the breakfast buffet here and it was one of the most lavish spread we have had anywhere in the world !must stay if you 're visiting kl . </DOC> spent 2 nights with family .main reason of staying is to be next to times square in door park and in bukit bintang .the staff are excellent .the staff and pool food is great .only the rooms are smelly presumably from no or in effective toilet vents .we took the 2 bedroom suite which has a sitting and small dinning room .good for kids </DOC> i was very concerned before we headed to kl having read some of the reviews about this hotel , however as we were lucky enough to be upgraded to a new refurbished room , there was nothing to worry about .the hotel is in a prime location right next to the berjaya times shopping centre and with walking distance of most attractions if you have the stomach for it - we walked to the kl tower and the petronas towers from it .the room we had was very spacious with a sitting area , large bathroom and seperate toilet and was scrupulously clean .staff could n't have been nicer and more friendly and the breakfast selection was excellent .it was our first trip to kland this proved a perfect choice to base ourselves at - would definitely return . </DOC> good and bad things happened ; bad things first . arrived at the hotel from the airport at 3.00 pm and was told the room not ready yet .everything was fine .room was big , clean and high up ( 43 floor ), the breakfast good and the staff from the doorman to the reception nice and friendly . </DOC> a nice hotel with a terrific location , just above berjaya mall and bukit bintang .the lobby is nonexistent but the rooms are very big with good views .worth every penny .i just loved the place ."
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'Love the hotel with its own private beach and a short walk to the beach. Rooms are very clean and well equipped with a kitchenette and a separate sitting area. rooms are very clean but the view from the pool is a little disappointing, despite being full , the staff are friendly and helpful . I would stay again & I will return</DOC>'

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'Threading is a great hotel with a great location and the staff were all very helpful and friendly. the rooms were not as clean as the room was not cleaned as it was the only one in the hotel , no tea/coffee making facilities , no bath and no complimentary tea & coffee. We were tired but not for that price , which is disappointing , not worth it</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'we found the best western windsor inn to be one of the very nicest we have stayed in a the price was great !the facility is conveniently located off of i-5 and is close to restaurants and gas stations ., this would of been the icing on the cake if it had been indoors . </DOC> the room was extra large with a very comfortable bed , sink separate from the toilet and shower / bath .the room was very quiet , clean , and comfortable .the breakfast was extra good with great yogurt , fresh breads , and good oatmeal .we enjoyed our stay . </DOC> although the hotel is on the outskirts of town it is a good alternative to its bw counterpart next to the shakespeare theaters .it is within driving distance to good restaurants .the price is right and the hotel is clean , the rooms spacious and the price is right .the breakfast is at best adequate . friendly staff . </DOC> superb breakfast , weight room , plus pool & spa , ample parking , clean , friendly , ez on and off , near gas , warm cookies in lobby , great coffee .rooms have 2 sink ante - bath , nice amenities , fridge , pillows and pillows and pillows , nice tv , free internet , comfy beds .i was in old section , the carpets need replacing ( faded and worn ) but other than that it was perfect </DOC> first time to this location , but we stay at best westerns while on our road trips .and they are all nice including this location .nice large rooms, that were very clean .the staff is very friendly , and there is lots of parking . </DOC> located a small distance away from the tourist center , this is the best place for families , hikers , and shakespere lovers like us .quite , near stores and great eating places , this is ideal if one wants to avoid crowds , parking pressures , etc .the option of a shuttle also helps to reduce stress .great plays , lots of other places to visit in the area . </DOC> we stayed at the windsor inn for graduation weekend at the university ... which is in the middle of the shakespeare festival ...both rooms were spacious .my mother commented on how comfortable the bed was in hers .the pool area was nice with a large spa .the grounds were beautiful ... rose bushes and other flowers in full bloom .convenient location just off the highway and only a short drive to the college , downtown or the festival .but if you like a big country - style breakfast , walk to the oak tree restaurant right next door . </DOC> this was a lovely place to stay , a little out of town but an easy drive away .the staff were very friendly and helpful .the room was clean and the bed was comfortable .the gardens were beautiful and well maintained .breakfast was adequate although paper plates and plastic cutlery are always a negative .'
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'Threading is a nice little hotel with a great staff and the rooms were very clean. the beds are comfortable and the water pressure was good , the food in the restaurant was good & they were all very pleasant , but with the exception of the pool & hot tub , hot tub & towels</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'i expected a sleep inn to be on the lower end among the choice hotels group , but these folks did an excellent job , and their breakfast was the best among this class of hotels where i stayed in different cities that week . </DOC> great staff ; everything was very clean ; good breakfast .it \'s pet - free !was very pleased that front desk turned away a potential guest with two constantly yapping dogs !shredded , lumpy foam !everything else in the room and common areas .the key card reader at the back door had been removed , so anyone could come & go at will from the back door .had a room towards the back of the property on the east side .did have to run the fan at night to block out the highway noise .a room on the west side may have been a bit quieter . </DOC> previous stays in amarillo were at the sleep inn & suites west medical center , but they raised their rates , so we decided to try the sleep inn airport this time , and are we glad we did .not only was it cheaper , the cracker barrel next door made the decision on where to have dinner a lot easier and we did n\'t have to get back out in the amarillo traffic after a long day on the road .we also ended up " sleeping in " , so we were able to enjoy the motel \'s hot breakfast of sausage , eggs , hash - browns , etc .breakfast was actually ready early , so we were able to eat and still get on the road around 6:00 for the drive to phoenix .we had a very comfortable and quiet night \'s sleep .we will be traveling through amarillo again in may and plan t </DOC> this is a nice place to stay .the room was a bit small , but nicely furnished and clean .the front desk staff made sure we got a room with easy access and was very helpful with information on the area .make sure you ask them to call the free limo service if you are going to the big texan to eat . </DOC> we stayed here on our way to taos / santa fe from okc .amarillo is pretty much a truck stop town , so you \xe2\x80\x99re not going to find anything great .this hotel checks all the boxes for me- clean , safe , affordable , easy access to the highway .we were also pleased with the decent free breakfast .when you check in and walk down the halls , you may have an \xe2\x80\x9cbecause it \xe2\x80\x99s a little dingy , but the room itself is nice and clean with modern updates .i would recommend this hotel to those passing through . </DOC> older hotel , but clean with very nice staff .decor is old and out of date .convenient location right next to i40 and across the parking lot from cracker barrel .room was clean .second floor room was fine , but no elevator , so plan accordingly .wifi was good .breakfast room was small andfood looked decent , but i decided to go to cracker barrel instead of listening to all of the complaints .the grass areas are very soggy , so if you walk on the grass , be carefulno bathtub , just a shower , but plenty of hot water . </DOC> this sleep inn is just like all the other sleep inns ... a cozy room , a mini frig , free wi - fi , etc .also , right next to cracker barrel which was nice ., i noticed a lot more red spots ... and 10 hours later , my body was one huge itchy field of skin .at least 83 bites that i slathered in itch creme .hopefully .... someone will make sure the hotel is free of bedbugs ...but i offer this as a word of warning ! </DOC> the front desk staff were exceptional and very helpful and cordial .i was especially impressed with olaf , a true public relations expert for both the hotel and amarillo .a great price , convenient location and a great breakfast make this a win - win location for me .'

SUMMARY:  b'Threading is a good place to stay in the area and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to get in to this hotel for a few days. Pros: the staff were friendly and helpful and room was clean & comfortable. wifi worked great - nice breakfast but i had to wait for the staff to be ready for check in, but they were out of order . but a bit far from the airport</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'i am shocked at the other reviews because in my opinion it was one of the worst hamptons i have every stayed atour room was old and dirty with stains on the ancient furniture and bugs in the bathroom .the bed was just ok .we were told we were getting a hilton honors upgrade which i doubt .we were placed on the first floor next to an exit where noisy guests were coming and going all night ( i assume to smoke ) .when i mentioned it to the staff they just blew it off .the only good news is that there are many restaurants nearby many within walking distance . </DOC> i believe they are the best value for non - luxury travelers .this hampton in anarillo is excellent .the staff is friendly and competent , the rooms are clean and the breakfast is just right .if your traveling on i--40 , i recommend this as a good place to stay ! </DOC> we arrived at 4:00 to fine our room " not ready , " but they had a beautifully clean and updated one ready for us on the second floor .everything smells so new and clean .we were treated like royalty .just great all around .500 \' walk to the outback steakhouse , and pizza hut is just across the parking lot .no need to move the car once you arrive here ......... and ten hours on the road makes that simply wonderful ! </DOC> this hotel may not be in a pretty location as the last advisor mentioned .however , it is conveniently located off of i-40 and somewhat away from the roar of the road .it is fairly new and has the wonderful cloud nine bedding .the lobby was very attractive , the staff courteous , and the breakfast buffet ample .amarillo looks like it going though a lot of changes .there is going to be a mix of the old and the new just about everywhere . </DOC> most hampton inn properties are good and this one was as you \'d expect .staff was helpful and checkin efficient .nikki was particularly helpful .you \'ll like this place . </DOC> this one in amarillo was ideal for the local places that we visited .the staff was very nice and helpful with information and driving tips .the room was excellent , clean , good bed , and we both got a very good night \'s sleep .the only slightly negative thing was that the parking is a bit confined .we came back from a trip downtown in the evening to find that all of the spots were full .but we managed and enjoyed our stay . </DOC> clean , affordable and easy to access from the highway .fitness room is small and lacks enough equipment but hotel is good .the staff was great and the parking was safe . </DOC> this is a typical hampton inn .the staff is friendly , the room was clean and the bed was comfortable .it \'s easy to find and right off the expressway .the kitchen staff was not keeping up with the people using the breakfast area .'
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'Threading is at the top end of the area and the staff were very friendly and helpful. This is a newer hotel with a few rooms with lots of hot water and no microwave & fridge. Staff were very friendly & helpful and the room was clean & comfortable</DOC>'

SUMMARY:  b"Threading stay here as a stopover in the area . Staff is friendly and helpful , room very clean and tidy with a good staff . Just one thing that was a problem was that I can't help but pay for the internet which has to be paid for internet access. No elevator with luggage and a taxi to the airport at 5:30 am</DOC>"

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"i spent several nights at le meridien and was generally disappointed in my stay .i expected a nicer property and this is more in line with a hampton inn in the city ( without the free breakfast ) .my main gripe is the size of the rooms and bathrooms- everything is small and feels cramped .the location is superb- walking distance to georgetown and easy driving access to 66 , 50 , gw parkway , 395 .that being said , there are so many wonderful hotels in the dc area , i do n't think i would stay at le meridien again . </DOC> so glad that starwood took this one over and cleaned it up .location is excellent , very close to georgetown and arlington national cemetery .you can easily find street parking after 630pm .hotel was very quiet and comfortable .they even offered a free wine tasting with your stay .for the value paid , it was a great deal .do n't underestimate priceline or hotwire , however , you wo n't earn your hotel points is the only draw back . </DOC> we really enjoyed staying here , and the proximity to the metro was super convenient .the rooms while a bit small , were first class and very comfortable .my only suggestion i would have for the hotel is we were very surprised there was not some kind of sundry shop for late night snacks .there are not a lot of options around there for late dining , and without a sundry shop there was really noting to bit on . </DOC> stayed here for a race i was running in dc .very close to the metro(subway ) .just a 2 block walk .entrance to garage is on 19th street .opposite of the cosi .once inside , the staff where great . room was large and super comfortable .bath was large and clean .room service was quick and the staff was incredible .wifi was good .did not have time to try the gym or restaurant .there are lots of choices in the neighborhood without needing to use the car .georgetown is across the bridge for shopping , etc.. i will stay here again for sure . </DOC> overall good recognition ( but no upgrade to a suite ) .location is close to roslyn metro station which provides easy access to most anywhere in the city and nearby reagan national airport .property is concluding a renovation and the new room style has a very residual feel to it .overall i would happily return next time i am in the area . </DOC> the hotel is small , so there 's limited service late at night .also , room service goes through the front desk at nightso that is also slow .that being said , the location is great and it is a 3 min walk to the metro .the rooms are nice and big , but the bathroom has poor water pressure and wall mounted shampoo and bath gel , which personally i do n't like .the bed was great though .and i had a good view of the river .basically , it 's not a great hotel nor is it bad hotel .for $ 150 a night it is probably a good deal .more than that there are better options elsewhere . </DOC> i recently spent one night at le meridien arlington while transiting though the dc metro area on my return to italy .the reception check - in area is located on the 4th floor where i was welcomed by steffie ; a most friendly professional .the check - in process was efficient and steffie pointed out various features in the hotel .the lobby is nicely decorated and spacious , having several areas for sitting in a comfortable environment .the spacious room had several windows overlooking georgetown .the sitting area featured a sofa , a large screen television , a desk and the view over looking the city .the bedroom was also comfortable , though i found the bed to be a little too firm for my likings .lines , pillows and comforter were just okay ; not top quality . </DOC> so happy that i chose this hotel during the inauguration weekend events .the hotel is located within a couple of blocks from the rosslyn metro station so a quick trip on the train from the airport and ideal spot to go anywhere in the city .the staff are extremely friendly and upgraded my room .my room was very spacious , clean , comfortable and quiet and had a view ( although you did have to be right at the window ) of the washington memorial and capitol dome . also enjoyed the short walk to georgetown , this is the most convenient location i ' ve stayed at to walk there without the georgetown prices .i ordered room service the first evening and the food was delicious .also tried calling for room service later that day and nobody in the restaurant answered ."
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'Thread is a new hotel with a good location , the staff was very friendly and helpful . the rooms are well appointed , clean and the room was very quiet at night . I had to ask for the front desk to be told my colleagues had their own bar service which was not a problem , i had to go to the bar and pay for food and then my bill was \xc2\xa330 for 4 nights . Hotel staff were helpful and polite . I would stay again but the bar / restaurant closed at 10.</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'everything was faultless .our superior room was beautiful , large , comfortable , spotlessly clean throughout our stayand we heard not a single sound from outside or inside .the corridors etc in the main building ( where we were ) are beautiful too .check - in with nina and check - out with federico were smooth and pleasant .we spent a lot of time at the pool - kudos to lucio , diego , fabio , caio and indeed everyone there for pleasant and efficient service .the pool is great although our first seating place suffered a bit from loud music ( and loud other guests , not the hotel \'s fault of course ) .breakfast is all you could wish for and , again , with excellent service .we \'re already planning to do this all again next year and for every anniversary .the place is just wonderful . </DOC> our experience was memorable in that it was one of the most relaxing times we had in our 5 days in rio .my ordered a delicious seafood pasta dish ,the meal was delicious and the service excellent .i had a lovely facial at the spa which was clean and modern .the front desk ladies were gathered around with other spa attendants chatting a bit much as if on breakbut they were nice enough .my dear boyfriend waited for me by laying by the pool , no issues from hotel staff except when he wanted to order a drink .he was told he \'d have to order and sit at the restaurant as poolside servicewas hotel guest only .its a shame as he would have ordered a few cocktails while waiting for me .we liked the look , service and ambiance of the hotel on our " day trip " .we will next time choose copacabana palace if we are in the city of rio again . </DOC> i the hotel rooms were very white and clean, big enough food at the hotel was good </DOC> this place lived up to my expectations to the very full - an architectural gem directly facing copacabana beach , with both hotel and beach being world famous of course .however whereas the beach is fun and vibrant but not one of the absolute best , the hotel is .breakfast is a feast , with fresh and varied tropical fruit standing out , the room i had was very spacious and elegant , the pool area is great ( as are the hotel restaurants around it ) and the staff are very professional and helpful .true , not everything may work to perfection( internet played up quite a bit ) , but the gracious staff are there to help out and to sort out matters to one \'s satisfaction .the bottom line here is that this place oozes charm and is clearly a grande dame on the international hotel scene .think rio , think copacabana palace - i ca n\'t wait to be back ! </DOC> room , pool , breakfast all top notch ., we feel it \'s as good as it gets , every member of staff smiling and quick to attend to any need ( e.g. fabio at the pool ) , people even learned our names even though we were there just three nights .we ate one night at cipriani - separate review for that - which is expensive , there are better options in rio .but our stay was great .it \'s expensive but worth every cent , in my opinion .we will definitely go back every year , if we can , to enjoy this iconic and lovely hotel . </DOC> this hotel is very nice and still honour the old school hotels which is rare now days .the hotel has a perfect location at the copacabana beach but due to that the beach is public this will not be a traditional beach hotel .they have a small spot on this huge public beachyou have to pass the big , heavily trafficked road outside before you reach the beachyou will end up by the pool . except this the hotel has nice rooms , very comfortable beds and good servicebut you want find the same service level as you do if you are similar hotels in europe or new york . </DOC> we have visited other belmond hotels and have always wanted to stay at the copacabana palace .this is an excellent hotel with very good service andthe location of the hotel is just something else .in terms of value for money it is of course difficult to call something costing 2000 brl good value , and as there are other excellent hotels very close by we will most likely go there next time we are in rio , now that we have tried to stay in the copacabana palace . </DOC> we dreamed of staying in a suite with a balcony overlooking copacabana beach .we found it at the palace .belmont understands understatement in luxury and service .the suites are elegant , quiet and simply beautiful .the giant pool is protected from the wind with pool service second to none .choice if dining , formal or relaxedand everything is a few steps from the famous beach .a dream come true .'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"a truly beautiful hotel like all belmond hotels in a beautiful location , but terrible service - lost my bag on check in , no service by the pool , 2 of 3 restaurants closed one night with only an asian one open ( i do n't want asian in brazil ) , key did n't work twice , was told gym did n't open till 7but it was 5:30 , car booked for the wrong time </DOC> copacabana palace is such a special hotel , it has a unique charm ! stayed in a beachfront roomand we absolutely loved it .great bed , beautiful view to copacabana beach , splurge if you can because it is totally worth it .the service is amazing .we were greeted very warmly and check in was fast .beautiful pool where it is the place to see and to be seen by locals, however we preferred going to the beach where they have a special reserved area with chairs , umbrellas wereit is safe to go and leave your things while enjoying the beach .this hotel is so special and would transport you to a world of old and refined class . </DOC> the hotel is superb in installations and charges a fairly hefty price for this .. the service at breakfast is the only negative point ..the chef doing the eggs was most unfriendly and when i asked for an omelette , asked me to look for a waiter with a form since he could not make my eggs without this form .. unbelievably rude .. as in hotel das cataratas , gringo guests receive far more attention than brazilian one </DOC> and it was pure luxury old world style .it was as good as , if not better than most suites i have ever stayed in , at other five star properties around the world .my biggest difficulty was getting myself out of the most comfortable bed i have ever slept in .yes the bathroom is a bit dated and could do with upgrading especially the plumbing as real cold wateralso the bathroom toiletries were poor for a hotel of this standard .the towels could also be replaced as like myselfthe free 24 hour internet access is a plus and again is appreciated by clients .this is a neccessary service and this alone would bring me back the lobby of this hotelwas at most times like a busy railway station and has no toilet facility .the nearest bathroom was at the pool and that was not working for 2 daysso it was a long walk to find a bathroom . </DOC> large beautiful hotel . excellent sized room with desk for working and two big windows . reccomend the view of copacabana beach and you can open the windows to let the sounds of the sea and beachgoers inside .the bath robes are excellent .nice varied artworks on the walls that look like real pictures .bathroom with two sinks , bath and good size .shower small but excellent hot water and lots of it .beautiful pool , very attentive staff . </DOC> beautiful hotel , great view of copacabana beach , impeccable service makes your stay unforgettable .beach service provides chairs , umbrellas and water to guest .breakfast was delicious , and the bar very happening ... went there to celebrate my birthdayand they send me a lovely cake ... </DOC> it is impossible to find fault with this hotel .situated right on copacabana beach ,beautiful ( and recently remodelled ) pool . excellent rooms ( go for a suite in the main block with views of the beach ) .the service provided by all the staff is exceptional .pergula restaurant provides an excellent breakfast ( including alternative ' milks ' ) as well as lunch and dinner options .there is a piano bar and also cipriani restaurant .we felt very safe in this hotel , important given that people can be wary in the area . </DOC> this historic hotel is very well located along the copacabana palace .it is very elegant and well - maintained .there are a few jewellery and gemstone shops within the hotel premises , one of which is h.stern .we loved to shop there ."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"the staff are extremely attentive in that they try to do everything for you , once you get accustomed to this its great .it was our first visit to egypt and we absolutely loved it !the staff in the buffet restaurant we always pleased to help , we were looked after by the two ibrahim 's ( little and large ) as we sat outside on the terrace most meal times .they were great , very friendly and extremely efficient , our glass was never empty .all the staff were friendly and helpful , we never had any difficulty in finding a place to eat for any of the meals .the best night </DOC> everyone from the animation team , bar staff , restaurant staff , gardeners , cleaners were all so friendly and worked very hard to make sure everything was ok .and we were offered a room which opened onto the garden overlooking the sea .if you want a quiet room do n't have a room in the main building as activities at night are outside the main building and can be noisey .the entertainment over christmas was excellent and the staff need to be commended on their efforts .all in all a truly enjoyable holidayand we would definately go back . </DOC> secondly , that the resort manager , takes the time out to reply guests comments on tripadvisor , which i find very professional and in keeping with the spirit of continuous improvement .we were picked up from the airport by the hotel minibus which was on time .the driver was extremely courteous and helped with all the luggage .the lobby was impressive on arrival , very largethe room was lovely , with a great view , everything you would expect from a modern hotel .very nice furniture , very modern . </DOC> check in was quick and efficient and was immediately offered an upgrade to our room which was a nice touch .we were taken to our room on a golf buggy and given a guided tour of the main area 's of the hotel .room - immaculate , spacious , given a ground floor room next to the infinity pool which was very handy .we could n't fault any aspect of the room , the beds were great , bathroom was awesome with a spacious walk in shower room .pools - 3 of them , family pool , infinity quiet pool and the rowdy pool ! ! !yes , as per other reviews , the pool is very dated with lots of tiles missing </DOC> hotel ; large reception area , well spaced out & plenty of seating areas .when we were ready to go to the rooms { x2 } we were taken by golf buggy on a short trip around the hotel , with all the relevant areas pointed out .overall very satisfied .restaurants - market , this is the main one for meals taken .quality was fairly good and always plenty available . </DOC> this is a really good hotel and one of the best in nabq bay which is only 15 minutes from the airport , the hotel and grounds are exceptionally clean and tidy and is a very well set out resort ..the only 2 issues we had is the spa which is the old dive centre shack on the beach and is not up to the standards this hotel deserves and also the food is not up to the 5star standard that the hotel is , there are 2 a la cartre restaurants which you can use once eachbut again the standard of food was not greatbut unfortunatly that seems to be typical of egypt .. great hotel otherwise </DOC> we moved after a few days at another hotel which was terrible and the moment we arrived the holiday was great .we were in cluster 5 near the sea , beautiful room , very modern ( big walk in shower , flat screen tv , clean , big bed etc , and i would recommend asking for a room at the sea end as it is quiet and beautiful .gardens full of flowers , big pool which was immaculately clean .staff could n't do enough to help and service was great .food in main buffet was good with lovely areas to it outside , the seafood restaurant was lovely but food in the seaside grill was a bit basic .wine is served by the glass and was good quality .a separate area next to family suites was always very quiet , with a big pool .i would be happy to return here , the management clearly do a good job of motivating and supporting their staff . </DOC> once again we were greeted by friendly staff who were there to help in any way they could .unfortunately because of the unrest in cairo the hotel was rather quietwe had a room in block 6 overlooking the infinity pool , the sea and tiran island .we do n't normally do all inclusive but after sampling it in december we decided to go all inclusive again and that is one reason we chose the cleopatra as the food we had previously was good .however , this time we were a little disappointed . whether it was because of the lack of guests or not i am not sure but three nights out of the seven we had fish on the outside grill and the rest of the food lacked a little something this time .this will not stop us from staying here againwe will certainly give it another try if we go back to sharm ."
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'Stay here for the first time in the last 2 years. This hotel is very well situated with lots of dining and dining options within walking distance to the beach and most of the attractions and restaurants. Room was spacious and room good size but clean and tidy and we had a lovely view of the bay with a view over the lake but they are not as big as we would have expected as the staff were not very friendly but they were all helpful & friendly & it was not cheap but you pay extra for it.</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'it was our first stay in montenegro , and our first visit to an aman property .we stayed in the sveti stefan suite which is extraordinary .the restoration work is tremendous .the garden is very nice , you have a wonderful view and you can enjoy your own private pool ( about 40 m\xc2\xb2 ) .in fact we left the suite only for meals and for a short visit to budva ( round trip with aman car was 30 eur ) .hotel & restaurants staff is great .they try hard and succeed in providing a very good service level . </DOC> i have to say i \' m a big fan of this aman for several reasons .... great service , great food , and great rooms .on the other hand , a friend of mine whom had done extensive travels throughout the world ( over 100 countries by age of 40 ) had highly recommended this aman as he said this resort was very unique among all aman properties as it \'s an unesco world heritage site .i was pleasantly surprised .although honestly i can stay there for few extra months in my gorgeous suite ....this aman is on an island right off the coast of montenegro .the island is connected to the coast via a walkwayso i guess it \'s really more like a peninsula than an island in my opinion .anyway , this island originally was a fisherman \'s island . </DOC> did n\'t get to stay at this resort - it had just closed for the season during my visit in october .just south of budva in montenegro , this is a good location for sightseeing along the adriatic coast .there are many wonderful sights nearby including the many churches in the fortified city of zadar and the walled city dubrovnik , just a short drive away .but it might just be worth it .what a unique setting on that little isle . </DOC> we really enjoyed our time at aman sveti stefan .one night only was not long enough .the location is spectacular , as is the privilege of staying on the island .our room was huge and we could have asked for nothing more , it was fantastic and in the aman style .food was exceptional , as was the visit to the private beach to swim in the adriatic . </DOC> what a beautiful and lovely decorated place !unfortunately , the service reminds you of a vacated youth hostel !yes , there are many helping hands around you , but hardly anyone has a clue of what he is doing .it starts with delayed pick up from the airport , no one at the reception to receive you , no room ready at check - in , noisy birthday party for the hotel managers two year old on saturday night , hairdryer broken , main private beach closed for three days , restaurants below par ... maybe aman should change this place into a " diy hostel " this would maximize the benefit . </DOC> i am actually thrilled to be able write this review because our stay was as close to perfect as any stay could be .not only was the staff amazing , the food fabulous and creative with a local touch , but the resort facilities and rooms are amazing .the rooms , bathrooms and views from the villa are simply amazing and the sunsets beyond spectacular .the rooms , typical of aman , are well designed , simple yet truly elegant and the historic villa milocer did not disappoint .the beds are really terrific as are the plush feather pillows .the new spa is simply gorgeous and serene .i had one of the most relaxing facials i have ever had and my partner enjoyed yoga classes from a true master . </DOC> other than the fact that the hotel perfectly fits its surroundings and the setting is right out of a james bond film , the service makes this aman stand out .unfortunately none of the hotels three restaurants had any spicy cuisine .so the hotel asked a private indian chef to come in and cook us a meal .now that \'s service ! </DOC> stunning location and all the facilities you need .three beaches , great spa , two good gyms and the accomodation was excellent .only minor criticisms are that there is a limited number of sun beds at the two pools on the island , and the attention to detail of service was nt quite up to the usual aman standardhowever once the manager was involved , everything ran smoothly .'
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'Thread is a very nice hotel with spacious rooms and a lovely pool with the water in the sun. the staff are so friendly and attentive and the food was quite good & plentiful & the staff were all helpful. Hotel was not as clean as it should be - it was not as clean as I have experienced at many other hotels I have stayed in</DOC>'

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'For the price its a good value with very good rooms and facilities are also excellent if you are looking for a good location for a night or two or two in the sun. Breakfast buffet is good , staff friendly and helpful , Room was also good , close to city centre , and the hotel is in a good location , as well as a visit</DOC>'

SUMMARY:  b'this hotel is fine with the standard of the room and the staff are friendly and helpful. Hotel is not far from the main road but convenient for access to the city centre and bus route. Car parking was adequate but a little expensive but acceptable . Overall not a bad choice but i would not stay again as it was not as good as most I\xe2\x80\x99d recommend for business travellers but not for a weekend</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"the rooms are old but large and elegant .the housekeeping staff and f&b people are very warm and courteous !the only drawback about clarkes is that you can not take your vehicle till the hotel and need to be dropped below at the high court parking .otherwise the rooms are well appointeda peaceful place to stay .i recommend the rooms facing the valley for a better view .also it 's at one end of the mall road , so taking a walk along shimla 's main attraction is easily accessible from clarkes ! </DOC> we had a little trouble initially as we were upgraded to a suite that turned out to be very noisy , at the end of the building .we asked to be moved and got a lovely room ( no 39 ) that was spacious and well equipped .i do n't think you will get any nice views from any of the rooms as the government has built a rather ugly high rise preventing views down into the valley .nice bar and restaurant andwell located at the far end of the mall .nice friendly service . </DOC> a very charming boutique property excellently managed by oberoi group .however , being on mall road , some of the rooms may not be so quiet .also , breakfast spread is a little limited for the tariff . </DOC> we stayed with a group travelling together and loved the position at the end of the mall .the rooms were generally a good size - doubles much bigger than twins .the food was fairly average , edible but not much to write home about . </DOC> there is no opulence , no outward luxury , no huge 109 item buffet spreads , but the simple grandeur of it 's history , the location , the views , the porch are sure to touch your heart .mozart playing in the background , and the absolute tender loving care you receive from the checking in , to breakfast , to housekeeping is excellent , and they do it from the heart not mechanically .. there is much genuininess .raman of housekeeping , mr dhani from the restaurant and chef praveenand of course the girl who checked me in.i got a lovely takeaway photo toowill definitely visit again.you have to climb stairs though , keeps you fit but they will help sort that out if difficult . </DOC> superb customer service , by all of the staff ; hotel manager , front desk , housekeeping \xe2\x80\x99s , and the restaurant .we liked that the chef came out at every meal and that all of the staff kept checking on us .location of hotel is right on \xe2\x80\x9c the mall \xe2\x80\x9c rooms were well appointed ., i do n\xe2\x80\x99t think the hotel has an elevator , if you ca nt walk steps ask for a room without a climb .another note unrelated to hotel .shopping in shimla is more reasonable than anywhere we ' ve been .this might be because we see no westerners on the street .the tourists are from india .no \xe2\x80\x9c hawkers \xe2\x80\x9d bothering you , the streets feel safe . </DOC> currently the town has been out of running water at a lot of places so having stayed where we hada great working shower was wonderful .the downside is that they are not very accommodating to our staff and refused to let our driver bathe or use the restroom .we know that this is a typical attitude and not uncommon in india .we prefer to do business with entities who believe in kindness to all . </DOC> its really a pleasure to stay at this property which is right at the mall road .the hotel has its own parking , but i found they should have atleast a couple of drivers to manage this car parking area , since it is small .overall the interiors of the hotel is just superb .they upgraded me to a suite and the rooms was just superb , very comfortable .a couple of restaurants , a bar everything was good .the buffet breakfast has a decent spread .overall the staff was courteous right from housekeeping to the front desk and restaurant staff .overall a great place to stay and the biggest advantage is that its right on the mall and with parking ."

Stayed in room service and food good , staff good , good shower , no complaints , but a train to reach from the hotel . Plenty of parking and easy access to city centre .</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"4-star hotel with good service ( airport pickup and dropoff is complimentary ) wifi is not always stable kitchen is ok , food is good bar is ok , but should be open during a wider range of opening hours </DOC> decent hotel very close to airport and metro station .good rooms better sleep quality .though the property is bit old is fairly maintained .good breakfast spread .decent lobby and restaurants can be recommended . </DOC> stayed for a night # 101 , near to the lift , the windows facing the pool . average breakfast , but quite helpful staff .front desk ladies are very helpful and will try to accommodate all your request with lots of smile and prompt action .overall a good business hotel at andheri east . </DOC> i looked around for a reasonably priced hotel in this area of mumbai and could n't find one .i was horrified at the difference in price between what resident indians and tourists had to pay .i read the one review here and took a chance .the price was right and everything seemed alright with the hotel - i had a good feeling about it .i was n't disappointed .the rooms were simple but provided everything you 'd expect .we ate in the hotel 's main restaurant - which served good indian food .the breakfast buffet ( included ) was great and mainly offered indian options .lunch and dinner was a buffet , but you could get a - la carte options .in the evening there was live music and many locals seemed to go there to eat . </DOC> i was checked in with smiling and welcoming faces at the reception .my room on the 5th floor was very good and seemed very nicely renovated with good decor and all amenities in the room as well as the toilets .the breakfast was good though all items except for the juice were the same every morning ....but there was enough and a good selection .over all the staff were warm and smiling every where in the hotel .the location is excellent if you want to be close to the bombay exhibition centre , the international airport or the domestic airport .autos and taxis are available just outside the hotel lobby .over all had a very nice and comfortable stay .the hotel provided free airport pick up and drop in my room tariff . </DOC> the hotel room was very basic and old fashioned .i did not mind it because i used the room only for a couple of hours .but the hotel needs to upgrade its rooms and the toilets to keep up with the modern times . </DOC> it was very reasonably priced and it 's proximity to the airport made it a sensible choice as we had a flight to catch the next day .while it is located very close to a road flyover , you would n't really notice once you are in the place itself .the dinner and breakfast buffets were good quality and pretty good value at rs700 for guests .staff were excellent and helpful .all in all a good and comfortable choice for the purpose . </DOC> not a totally negative experience , but nothing like as good as my previous one the reception staff very surly and the works being carried out right outside the front of the hotel very intrusive butthe location is great - and there is a charm about this indian hotel which the international ones do n't have jury is out on this one"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'Love the hotel and the staff are very friendly and helpful .i was booked in to an executive room which was a bit small. the reception staff were helpful but not a good ,good location with good restaurant and bar & restaurant. i think the hotel is a bit dated but still ok for a night but not for everyone</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'i like the aloft brand - sure there a quirks like there is only the self service kitchen for food , but i like that !the rooms are very comfortable , and on this occasion i left my phone behind after i had checked out , and they found it and fedex\'ed it to the other end of the country with no fuss .top marks to them ! </DOC> we stayed the night here while on business and the location is great .right in downtown homewood with lots of shopping and restaurants right out the door .the hotel blends into the surroundings and you park on the street in front of the hotel .it is a modern hipster vibe hotel with a pool table in the lobby .check in was fast and efficient .the rooms are ok .the beds are very firm which i likeit is a very green hotel so if that \xe2\x80\x99s important to you that is a plus .it is an expensive hotel as we were 200 dollars per night . </DOC> rooms were very clean , stocked well , lit beautifully and exceptionally well designed ...the desks were spacious and had outlets up top for laptop and phone chargers ... essential if you need to set up an office on your stay .the location is the perfect balance of busy ( at least 6 great places to eat across the street , including a magnificent sushi place ) and quiet ( no noise complaints from any in my group ) .the best part was that most places were open late , but if you missed them , there was a mini convenience store up front that never closed , and stocked food you \'d actually want to buy .. not just vending machine snacks . </DOC> great stay as always .love the easy parking here too , and it \'s a great little neighborhood full of cool little shops and independent restaurants .room was great as always .staff was very friendly . </DOC> i spent 2 nights at the aloft birmingham soho square ( in homewood ) in may .and i came along for the ride .the hotel just opened in april , and i will second the other reviewers comments about location and style of hotel .it \'s very safe and there are some restaurants and shops right across the street and down the street , with what looks like even more places coming soon .there is a bar and ample seating with some seating outside next to a see - through fireplace .employees working the front desk greet you with " aloha " .rooms are kind of spartan .also , there is not a convenient outlet for the hairdryer . </DOC> this hotel is not on the luxurious side , but is comfortably basic , except for the room lighting .there are two lights over the bed , and they are operated by one switch .the staff is really nice and helpful , and the lobby is large with lots of places to sit .it would be nice to have a towel rod by the bathroom sink , too .the shower toilet area is in an adjacent little room , so any towel , washcloth has to be placed in there or laid on the counter ... not convenient . </DOC> it was clean and appointed properly for both business and pleasure .the staff was great with check - in and out very fast .both lyft and uber know how to get here .it is also in walking distance to plenty of places to eat . </DOC> never had any problems .'
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'Threading stay here for the last time and it is a good value and the best value in my opinion. Pros: Clean room , good size bed , very clean , good wifi , staff friendly and helpful , good location , the only issue is that they do not have tea & coffee making facilities but they do have a hot breakfast</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'homewood suites seem to be the hilton brand that is fantastic when they are new , but get tired in just a few years .this one is beyondit \'s prime , but a good cleaning of the elevators and bed spreads would make a huge difference .no quick shop for food in walking distance but a nice pub / pizza place across the street .homewoods have a small shop by the front desk , but the prices are very high .lots of military youngsters stay here which is nice .ask for the government rate . </DOC> this is easily the best choice for a hotel in huntsville - especially if you book with hilton points .the rooms are spacious and clean .having the mini - kitchen is convenient .the breakfast is ample and good quality .but it \'s free , it would be nice if there was some dessertbut there \'s a frozen yogurt place right around the corner .the staff is great - very sincere and not intrusive .ask for an even numbered room - those face the inner parking lot and are more quiet .a delivery truck sometimes parks under your window and leaves their engine running .... </DOC> the village of providence is a " bubble " community like the woodlands north of houston or celebration , florida ( or stepford , ct ) .hotels , condos , a few stores , and very specifically chosen restaurants make it , if you want it to be , a self - contained village - which can either be very convenient , or like something out of a twilight zone episode .village notwithstanding , the hotel itself is very good .clean , quiet , very pleasant staff , and generous rooms and amenities .i will unquestionably go back next timei have any call to be in the area .no question if i have to be in huntsville or the space center , this is the place to stay . </DOC> this is a fairly new hws and is clean and well presented .i chose this hotel as it is located in providence village and has many restaurants near by .morning breakfast and evening reception are a bonus , and the attendants were very friendly and service oriented .my studio room was spacious , fully stocked with amenities for preparing meals , and clean .overall a fine stay , and i will stay here again when in the area . </DOC> - everything was good , price was very ok .i will definitely stay there when staying in town- it is a very good option for the longer stays .there is a parking in and outside of the property .staff was very welcoming and they fixed all documents i needed - with smile ! </DOC> 2 week stay - staff was wonderful - location is awesome in the middle of an upscale neighborhood with shops , restaurants , bars , etc .within a 2 block area - also a short drive from many more options .good - tv reception was a little spotty at times - breakfast andhappy hour food and service were good and the ladies manning the kitchen were very attentive .my only complaint was logging in to the internet service - it took from 1.5 minutes to a high of 3.75 minutes ( i started timing it because it was so pitiful ) to get logged on !given that huntsville is such a technology city - this surprises me .fixing this issue will raise my rating to " excellent " . </DOC> very clean , comfortable hotel .we would definitely stay here again .in the middle of a very safe , clean little village area .walking distance to great restaurants and bakeries ! definitely check out edgar \'s for breakfast . </DOC> an average homewood suites , but the pool deck is slippery as ice when it is wet .it was scary as heckand he screamed bloody murder .when i mentioned it to the mgr , she seemed concerned , but then told me that nobody had ever complained before .i told her to walk out there and try it herself with wet , bear feet , but seriously doubt she did .needless to say we did n\'t use the pool at all during the rest of our stay .the room itself was your typical homewood suite , but there were burnt out lights and a cabinet knob that housekeeping was nice enough to leave on the kitchen counter .we had to have maintenance come up and replace the bulbs and fix the cabinet door .the mattress was also overly soft and in desperate need of replacement .'
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b"Second time staying here and this is one of the better ones with a large hotel that is well maintained. it was clean as always the staff were friendly and helpful, room was clean , comfortable beds , good shower , no microwave but good value for money , it's a bit far from the main road but i think it has a good breakfast , some food , staff was friendly , good as always</DOC>"

SUMMARY:  b'Stay here as it is the only hotel in the area , it\xe2\x80\x99s the best option in town . Clean room and good size , good shower and hot water . Everything is clean and very well maintained . My only complaint is there is no shampoo and conditioner for laundry. Will not be returning</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'stayed one night and was in room 6237 in the new tower overlooking the river , water street and the railroad tracks .staff courteous and professional and the room was clean and the beds comfortable .unfortunately , we stayed the night while a movie was being filmed and ongoing construction was taking place at the tower .that aside it is still a very nice hotel and would stay again when in mobile .the hotel is in a great location to walk around and see the old buildings and parks . </DOC> we stayed here again on our way back from disney .check in and valet were awesome .we booked a double queen in the new tower .views were of the river and are great .room was very clean and upscale .beds were perfect .the lobby was decorated for christmas and was spectacular .we will definitely stay here again . </DOC> the staff here remember your name and the small renovated history aspect is very appealing .the lobby is simply beautiful .the hotel does a wonderful job with \' the little things \' which is always welcome for a business traveler .the 7th floor club room for status guests is cozy and fits the bill .the only place to stay in downtown mobile . </DOC> this was a refreshing taste of comfort and character .the battle house is wonderful for any age hotel .it is in the heart of downtown mobile .lots to see and do within a very short walk .walking distance is important because the unfortunate thing about this hotel is that it is valet only .so if you need to drive it can be a haste getting your car to go .the lobby is gorgeous .it is grand yet comfortable .the food was decent enough .two pet peeves of mine though we \'re the tip jar for the staff and hours of operation . </DOC> if you enjoy historic hotels than a stay at the battle house in downtown mobile is a must .the lobby and ballrooms are amazing , intricately designed with grand , local flare . make sure you explore the entire hotel .our room , while indeed modern , was n\'t obnoxious modern .our bathroom was certainly adequate but could use an upgrade .the location is excellent .you \'re close to the water , but it \'s also easy to get around mobile \'s incredibly pedestrian - friendly downtown .this hotel is expensive , but again , if you enjoy historic hotels , it \'s certainly worth staying here . </DOC> the hotel is lovely and i look forward to coming back .the hours of the concierge lounge are very limited , especially on the weekends .after lunch on friday the lounge at the battle house is basically closed except for breakfast hours .there are n\'t a lot of places easy to walk to to grab a coke and a bar .on sundays the downtown basically shuts down .again this is a small problem and easy to fix .also , the rooftop pool is awesome but in dire need of repair .there are rows of tile falling off and a large hole in the bottom of the kids pool .it would be easy for a child to cut their foot on the opening .as i mentioned , this is a great property . </DOC> this is an outstanding facility with great personnel working there .we chatted with katie and jazz while getting checked in .and he was really nice too !we chose not to use the valet service but instead parked nearby at a paid lot .this hotel is located in downtown mobile near " the spot of tea " and " hopjacks " .these are two good places to begin and end your day with a bite to eat .this is really a great place to unwind and spend some quality time with your significant other .we will definately come back to this hotel .also this is an rsa hotel for alabama teachers and government employees .the rate we paid was really good and the location is super ! </DOC> nice people and very helpful .room comfortable but pillows were too squishy .i was not too thrilled about being in the tower ...so it was tough to get around in the lobby and get a taxi .otherwise the stay was very nice .best part was the fireworks show right outside my window ... do n\'t know the occasion but was a great view !'
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'Been to this hotel for the past 5 years and we have stayed in many hotels in the area. Hotel is located just off the main road and has very good reception staff , the location is great , lots of restaurants and bars , a few restaurants and bars . Rooms are large with lots of room and excellent shower . Staff were friendly , good and helpful . Very good .</DOC>'

SUMMARY:  b"the property is well located with a great pool area with the staff really helpful and the rooms were very clean and tidy. the only thing I can say is that there were no towels and no coffee in shower.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'this was a good choice for business trips with my family and the staff are always friendly on the phone . Nice room , but not the cheapest hotel . Busy at night , staff very friendly . Only issue was that my bed was not clean . No coffee or tea making facilities . Not sure why the staff were more friendly but not overly friendly . Would not recommend but i would recommend and will return</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"the hotel appeared to be quiet but using a free night certificate we received ; - room at the top of the new tower with a spectacular view of shanhai 's pudong area ( the famous view ) - 1000 bonus points - free welcome drinks ( up to 100cny value per person , 2 people ) - free breakfast in the hotel restaurant ( which was delicious , eggs on order and the eggs benedicts was delicious and served with very nice hash browns ) similar to many we had issues with taxis finding the hotel enterence , we were dropped on the bund ( as we knew where the hotel was and pointed it out ) only to find reception was the other side of the building which is a long walk away .the checkin staff knew our name and were waiting for us , we were offered checkin in the room but skipped it . </DOC> greatly impressed with this hotel .very friendly helpful staff , excellent rooms .our room was huge and even had a chandelier in it .the location is right on the bund with views across to pudong . </DOC> this waldorf - astoria is one of the most highly - reputed top hotels of shanghai , where virtually all top brands are installed , and it lives up to this acclaim .it has two wings , the historical riverside wing and a new block occupying a large full street block , yet it has only 260 rooms .d\xc3\xa9cor is of traditional waldorf standard and even bedrooms have chandeliers and well - equipped .internet is free and very fast .great location on the bund , many rooms have river view .great breakfast via a very long buffet table .it is a luxurious stay to remember . </DOC> stayed here for one friday night and overall it is great .room was n't too impressive but the bed was super comfortable .had a late breakfast and food from menu is better than food from buffet . </DOC> it just felt so comfortable , relaxing , with a hint of luxury .i booked a river front view and being a hilton diamond membercheck in was seamless , your own butler meets you in the lobby and then escorts you to you room to complete check in .the rooms are large and beautifully laid out , a fantastic view of the bund with a large lounge , bedroom and bathroom .the bed is large and very comfortable andthe bathroom one of the best i have experienced .the location is perfect being right on the bund , offering superb views from your room in the evening and access to many shopping options and top restaurants .a little expensive but well worth it .would absolutely recommend . </DOC> it is a wonderful hotel .this time we were offered a room with city view , not as exciting as the river view room we were offered the first time . from the river view room , you can have a breathtaking view across the huangpu river and all the landmarks like the pearl tower , etc . in the pudong area .the staffs are well trained and friendly .the breakfast is excellent with an eclectic selection of foods .as a diamond member , we were offered two free drink coupons at the bar ( the first stay ) , which was very nice with live music performance .the swimming pool is very good , providing a serene environment to relax .the location is ok , situated on the other end of the bund .you can take a walk on the bund and enjoy the scenery .there are a lot new developments beyond nowadays , making the hotel a center of activities . </DOC> this hotel is everything you 'd expect of a five - star property .great location on the bund , amazingly lovely rooms , incredibly professional and helpful staff .the rooms are sumptuous , with high - tech features like a toilet seat that automatically opens when you enter the bathroom and window coverings that open at the push of a button .they are reminiscent of hotel rooms in the long - lost days of true luxury travel .and it was such a treat .it was very cool to have a drink in an atmosphere of time gone by .practically speaking , as others have noted , this hotel is located right in the middle of the action on the bund .from pvg , we preferred to book a transfer because we did n't want to negotiate public transportation , but that cost was only about $ 100 usd . </DOC> we had an upgrade to a deluxe river view room which was exceptional in terms of quality , comfort , amenities and size .we both consider the property to be the most spectacular we have stayed in on our travels .breakfast was amazing , lots of things on offer , whatever your taste or preference .free internet was a welcome bonus .in terms of location , the hotel is central to the downtown area and the bund for sightseeing and shopping .if you are spending some time in shanghai you would be hard pressed to better this establishment ."

SUMMARY:  b'Been to this hotel a few times now. we stayed in the annexe with the views of the lake and it is well worth the price and very comfortable room with great views of the city and surrounding areas. Staff are friendly and helpful (and free parking, free parking, wifi, free wifi, free wifi etc.).The staff were friendly & helpful & rooms were very well equipped & tidy.</DOC>'

SUMMARY:  b'this is a nice hotel with great facilities and the staff were all friendly and helpful. the rooms are fine albeit not large but no view over the pool which was not open on sunday as it was raining outside but no lift for the day , no tea making facilities * No elevator to the room , no coffee available . Would I stay there again ? Yes it\xe2\x80\x99s not as good as it should be - but they should not be on the same floor</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"everything is top - notch .the restaurant on site serves great food , too .but , when you are at arenal volcano , who needs wifi ? </DOC> our room was almost next to the gift shop .it had a pool right outside the back door and a fantastic view of the volcano .and we had a complete view of the volcano with no cloudsit was the best view we had from anywhere .the rooms were nice but the grounds were immaculate .the hot springs we nicedef worth a stay .we stayed 2 nights . </DOC> we were here using a groupon deal and the room and grounds were great !my only negative was that the internet was very unreliable and there was no cell signal for my local cell phone unless i marched around looking for a spot with some reception .the other caveat is that to go anywhere you must take a taxi and they are no cheap .the hotels in la fortuna should get together and start a shuttle ! </DOC> very well kept grounds and outstanding service .you are greeted with a smile and some great fruit juice .the front desk personnel are outstanding .the facility is very well maintained and contains a vast array of plants in extensive gardens .you will love it !also the view of the volcano is outstanding .every morning we enjoyed the excellent breakfast and in the late afternoon we love the pool !i highly recommend the volcano lodge jim ingersoll author , investing now </DOC> we had spent 5 days in the guanacaste area and came to arenal to finish up our costa rica visit .we spent two nights at the volcano lodge and we were also very happy here .while the rooms are not huge , nor resort - style luxurious , they were big enough , spotlessly clean , and by no means shabby .we had perfect views of arenal volcano( it looked like all rooms had similarly fantastic views ) .rooms have a small outdoor patio with rocking chairs where you can sit , listen to the river below , and watch the volcano ( or not , depending on the clouds ! ) and exotic birds ( flocks of parakeets and parrots ) .the breakfast buffet at the new restaurant was vey nice .the desk is helpful with booking excursions .all together , a very nice lodge . </DOC> it is breathtaking .the service is great , the pools are fun , the food is awesome , but the beds are very firm .if that does n't bother you , then you ca n't go wrong at this hotel . if this hotel had more comfortable beds , i would give it 5 starts . </DOC> a nice welcome and drink at reception , then a short walk to the rooms which are arranged around a lovely garden .the rooms are spacious and well equipped , with aircon and a good bathroom .there is a \xe2\x80\x98 back door \xe2\x80\x99 to a small patio where you can sit quietly and you will be rewarded with plenty of birdlife that come closethe restaurant and pool are a short walk through more gardens , and each is excellent .there are lockers , towels and lovely changing rooms .the restaurant has a lovely waiter - served main dinner with a choice of dishes for each course . </DOC> the staff was amazing friendly and helpful .they showed up a list of tours to go on but also showed us an option to do the same thing on your own and save money .the breakfast buffet was awesome and we almost skipped lunch every day because of the variety and quantity of food offered .the jacuzzi was great .they have two lovely swimming pools as well .the location of the hotel is great .it is right next to a couple of cheap hot springs in case you do n\xe2\x80\x99t walk to venture out in a car or taxi .during our visit we saw toucans .the volcano was always hidden behind cloudsbut that was the case everywhere during our stay even if you did the volcano hike .on a clear day you can see the volcano from most rooms .we absolutely recommend this hotel even at it full room price ."
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'Been there a few times now and have always found it to be a great resort with all the amenities you can want or an overnight stay ,the staff are friendly and the rooms are very good size,good shower,and everything was clean. Hotel is in the midst of a shopping centre and it was quiet so we could walk to some restaurants and bars & restaurants</DOC>'

SUMMARY:  b'Been to the hotel for 3 nights while visiting family in the area and our room was ready for us . Great location with good restaurants and shopping nearby . the only negative is that it is a bit dated but this is a good thing . Free wifi and free breakfast . Gym was good but again very basic gym equipment . Car parking.</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"we frequently stay at best western properties and usually find them to be quite nice .we had a nice large room with a better than average breakfast included .our room had a completely new bathroom and bed among other furnishings .there is also a separate restaurant and lounge as part of the hotel .i think the bw and the hotel at the end of the spit are probably the biggest and nicest in town , but the bw is well located , near restaurants , the beach and the visitor center . </DOC> we stayed at best westerns in three cities in alaska ( anchorage , steward and homer ) as a compromise between quality and cost .this place was a bargain compared to other offerings .the breakfast was relatively good and the hotel is located on the main road into town .the room was relatively large . </DOC> when i arrived i was told that my room wasnot ready even though i requested early check in and yet others who came after me got their rooms .when i returned 2 hours later there was a line for check inand i had to wait another 20 minutes despite the fact that there were two front desk people visiting in the back .i was given a room in the front of the hotel that was so noisyi could n't even hear the tv because of the road noise and parking lot noise . .and the noise was constant .the room was a handicap accessible room and the vanity and shower were very inconvenient .this was one of the worst best western experiences i have ever had .and the front desk staff was terrible . </DOC> we were with norwegian cruise tour , and stayed here as part of our land portion .no view , dated room and bath , just off the main road into town .but located near access to the beach , where one can witness spectacular sunrises and sunsets , take nice strolls along the beach , and can walk quite some distance seaward in low tide .eagles sighted in the beach .breakfast was good .wi - fi worked well too . </DOC> our room ( 155 ) at the bidarka had to be one of the largest my wife and i have ever stayed in and provided both comfort and plenty of space to move around .the hotel is located on the north end of town but convenient for driving access to the homer spit and local attractions .overall a totally enjoyable stay at a reasonable price </DOC> simply stated , this motel was the best in which we stayed during our 8 day alaka visit .the staff was very friendly , and the room was spacious with a wonderful view .the breakfast was excellent and the hosts and hostesses were very friendly and accommodating .the breakfast room and guest room were impeccably clean .thanks for a great stay . </DOC> we had a partial of the mountains too .the beds were comfortable .the complimentary breakfast was good and was available for four hours which was wonderful .but i think that is true of this area .we were in room 252 which is in the main building and right by the breakfast area . </DOC> friendly staff upgraded our room when she saw we had a reservation over the bar . ended up with a large , quiet room , parking just outside the door .one of the best free breakfast rooms offered , lots of windows over looking town and the bay , and great choice of real food .easy to find location on main drag coming into homer , really good price ."
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'I originally enjoyed our stay , the room was comfortable and the staff friendly and helpful . the reception area is a bit dated . the rooms have a good size , and a bit shabby but with good quality . Not a good stay .A few good places to eat and breakfast .</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"the property is not new but has been refurbished and is kept in very good condition .front desk staff very pleasant .the price was quite reasonable . </DOC> took a chance with this comfort inn and were pleasently surprised with the general cleanliness and size of the room .not a resort but a quiet place to recharge for another day of driving .even had a nice continental breakfast included in the low price .because of it 's relatively out of the way location , a reservation was not required even though i had called ahead . </DOC> we found this to be a reasonable priced hotel with a good location .the room was adequate size for two people and clean .you will need to go to the end of the hall on the 2nd floor , down the steps then down part way on the 1st floor to get to the front desk / breakfast area ! confusing and long !the breakfast is adequate , but the seating area is very inadequate .customer service was helpful and friendly . </DOC> great staff easy access to interstate and shopping .plenty of food options nearby as well .nice clean pool .i will stay here again . </DOC> we 're on a 30 day road trip of southern us .i am fanatic about clean and also very frugal .this location met both .very clean , better than average breakfast and reasonable price . recommend ! </DOC> this is my go to hotel in casa grande , where i have to be for events several times a year .first of all , the rooms are updated and very clean , the beds are comfortable , the tvs are brand new and get tons of channels , the wifi works well , and the toiletries are really nice ( they have recently switched to a better brand and include nice lotion and conditioner ) .tea available at any time of day and the lobby in general is a very pleasant place to hang out and work or socialize .the fitness center has a pretty good elliptical machine , treadmill and exercise bike , and they 're pretty relaxed about letting you use it past the 10 pm deadline .i got excellent service from the staff this past week -- </DOC> if i had i would have protested the safe fee that was tacked on .room was fairly decent with newer carpeting and was clean .bathroom could use an upgrade .bars in shower were falling out of the wall , the sink was clogged and the faucet was old and cruddy .at least they fixed the light in there within 5 minutes of our checking in .or we probably would have had no light in bathroom .breakfast was ok , very glad that it was ready and put out before 6 am even on sunday .a / c worked well and staff was friendly . </DOC> about the only drawback / negative thing that i found while staying here was that there was not an elevator .other than that i really enjoyed my stay there ."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"we had room 204 with excellent ocean view , enough space and a cool glass top .our view was awesome andthe room itself is charming but not superfancy .the kitchen is nicebut we never used it .the service is ok but we did not really understand we check - in before 4 pm was not possible and check - out was already at 10 am . </DOC> my wife and i stayed 6 nights at this hotel recently and it was the perfect choice .the hotel is not too expensive and has decent - sized apartments ( equipped with a flat - screen tv and a complimentary bottle of wine thrown in ! ) .but the clincher must surely be the superb location ( with the sea in front and the backdrop of table mountain and the twelve apostles ) and the great bars and restaurants just seconds away .the area is safe as it is heavily patrolled by the police and security guards , so security at night is not a concern .camps bay is not very far from the centre of cape town , and you have the options of taxis , minivans or buses .all in all , this is definitely the place to stay in cape town ! </DOC> the hotel was perfectly located with a great view of the beach , and then the 12 apostles behind .the reception staff and restaurant / breakfast staff were all top notch and really helped us enjoy our stay .we had a 1 bed apartment ( room 306 ) which was spacious , well equipped ( including jacuzzi tub ) and had a huge balcony .i especially liked the made to order omlettes .camps bay itself is lovely with a wide sandy beach ( although we found the sea too cold to swim in ... same with pool really which does need heating )i had a massage at the adjoining fairways hotel which was superb .we would definitely return . </DOC> we like to end our south africa holidays in camps bay , which is expensive .the place on the bay is at the more affordable end .we had room 105 which was right at the front with a terrific view .just inside the french windows and watch the sunset .this room was a bed / sit with small kitchenette and ensuite .the room was bright and spacious ; kitchenette well equipped ; bathroom somewhat tired . </DOC> the location of the hotel is a dream .right on the main road in camps bay .a short walk to the beach and restaurants .the rooms are modern , most having a terrace area for outside dining / drinking .we were lucky enough to be upgraded to a 2 bedroom 2 floor apartment .this was n't necessarily good news .however , despite these 2 problems , the hotel was nice , but i would n't stay there again in the hot season . </DOC> ideal location in the northern parts of camps bay right at the beach and next to mynt caf\xc3\xa9 .very friendly service and free parking inside the gates .spacious apartment for three peopleno breakfast , but possible to get at the cafe next door . </DOC> i stayed in a standard studio room ( 305 ) , for 10 nights at the place on the bay hotel during the easter holidays .if you have a car , there is secure parkingand you are issued a remote for the gate , which is very useful as the adjacent streets get busy at certain times of the day / week .the receptionists marion , leila and wonder were very friendly and helpful and made my stay an enjoyablele one .the room had a sea view and was kept very clean , with lots of storage space in the bedroom and bathroom .the pool is vey small and there is n't much space for sunvbathing , plus the hotel does n't attarct the sun until around 10.30 am and the right hand side gets the most sun . </DOC> camps bay is one of the most spectacular places around cape town with the beach and the table mountain as a background .the hotel is within walking distance of good restaurants and interesting bars where you can have a cool one as you watch the sun go down .the place on the bay is convenient if nothing else .as a a family we had a roomy apartment over 2 floors .rooms were on the small side .there is a pool area .in summary i would call the place convenient rather than inviting ."
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'I was not disappointed with the hotel but the view from our room is spectacular . the staff were friendly and helpful , the location is a short walk to the centre of town and plenty of parking . A very good night sleep and a good nights sleep . Location was excellent . close to the town centre and good breakfast . Would recommend as a base for exploring the city .</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"we stayed here at the end of our holiday and it compares well with other hotels we stayed at that cost far more .just 5 minutes from the waterfront but in a lovely peaceful courtyard you have the best of both worlds , nice modern rooms and a high service ethos by the staffwill make this my preferred venue on return to cape town . </DOC> the hotel itself is stunning and only a few minutes walk from v&a waterfront .the hotel is in a sort of complex with a couple of other hotelsso it 's very quiet at night .we had a mountain view room which i would highly recommend ( if the weather 's good ) as you can see table mountain right out of the window .breakfast each morning was a wonderful buffet with an a la carte hot breakfast menu also .we could n't fault the service at all .all of the staff were incredibly helpful and knowledgable and we wanted for nothing .would definitely recommend this hotel , one of the best i ' ve stayed at worldwide ! </DOC> we were here with a business group and the hotel worked out well for our meetings , departures to off sights , etc .the hotel is very conveniently located to the v & a waterfront with plenty of shopping and dining venues .rooms were generously sized with all the normal amenities . </DOC> the hotel was very welcoming and found rooms fo my colleaguesthe room was very large and well equipped .the staff were polite and helpful .the hotel is within walking distance of the waterfront and so nicely located for sight seeing . </DOC> my partner and i were booked for four nights in this hotel at the suggestion of our local travel agent who was helping to organize our multi week trip .trust the locals !this hotel is adjacent to the lively waterfront with a wide election of shops , restaurants and attractions but removed enough to present a more tranquil atmosphere .the service is five star and our room was beautifully appointed with a nice balcony and very large bathroom that included a separate shower and heated towel rack .the 30 rooms are arranged around an internal courtyard that presents a large living room like space with several inviting seating areas .do n't skip the nightly turndown service as the yummy treats are very special .the bar area is enhanced with a fireplace and a grand piano in the evenings .breakfast was included in our rate and it was hands down the best we experienced on the entire trip . </DOC> great location right next to waterfront .nice immaculate room with a nice but dark bathroombreakfast at the hotel was good .located across the road from the waterfrontso noise and security were not a problem .views form the windows were not inspiring .best surprise was the lovely garden and pool in a sister hotel a few metres away -although </DOC> very first time to cape town and really did not know what to expect .selected the hotel based on reviews and location .lacklustre welcome on check - in and to be honest , reception staff were not that friendly or helpful .kindly shown to my room which is always a nice touch .very decent sizebathroom was enormous with one of the largest showers i have seen .great towels and decent local toiletries .the continental selection was pretty good and some interesting a la carte options .bar was also a pleasant place to have a drink and was very reasonably priced .dinner was also pretty good and we recommend the chef 's menu for value .the hotel is well located on the water front from and not far from downtown ( walk or taxi ) . </DOC> we decided on staying at the quenn victoria at the suggestion of our travel agent primarily due to location and reputation .it is small , quiet and well appointed with a terrific upscale restaurant and bar area .we used it as our base camp as we explored the attractions of cape town and the surrounding area .we really enjoyed our stay ."
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'we were on the road with a special place to stay in this hotel,the room was comfortable and well appointed . the staff are friendly and helpful and they have an excellent restaurant and bar menu . A bit of a walk to the city centre but far enough away from the sea and taxi bus which is a plus point. Only stayed one night</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'a huge room with king bed , luxurious bathroom , and a great location .the breakfast was included and was excellent , as was the service .if you play golf make sure you stay long enough to play on the oubaai course - it \'s outstanding . </DOC> this is truly great value for money top class hotel .it is a 15 minutes drive from george , the airport and fancourt , and is a perfect launch pad for trips around the garden route .the rooms include great facilities , are modern and very large by international standards .the bath rooms are unique and the roof shower most enjoyable .we were a large group of cyclist and the hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful to look after all our needs and special meal requirements .the hotel has some of the very best views of the mountains , and we enjoyed breakfasts overlooking the greater george area .we did have perfect blue sky \'s </DOC> my first visit this side of a south africa and this was my base for two days as i took part in the knysna forest marathon .the hotel is so nice and quiet such that on my check in i asked where was everybody .the hotel is in on a golf estatethe rooms are splendid and well kept , the grounds spotless and the staff very courteous .i would definitely stay a little while longer next time and perhaps begin work on my biography as the hotel is the perfect place for some peace and quiet time . </DOC> the staff could not have been more helpful or welcoming .the room was large with a comfortable bed and good shower .unfortunately the two restaurants we went to were not very good .i suspect there is not enough turnover for them to offer a huge selection although the quality was reasonable .the restaurant offering the buffet supper was cavernous with absolutely no atmosphere .the a la carte restaurant had better decor but was still rather flat .the hotel gives you access to a wonderful golf course </DOC> a 5 star experience , except for the really hard bed .we opted for the " game drive " package on the hotel \'s website : room , breakfast and game drive for two .the staff was very friendly and helpful with our tour planning .the resort is reasonably close to the george airport , and located out in picturesque countryside overlooking the indian ocean in the distance .the restaurant is excellent , and we enjoyed a fine dinner and a good breakfast buffet ( anyway , no other food option is close ) .the included afternoon game drive to the nearby ( 30 min . )botlierskop private game reserve was an exciting introduction to our nature experience in south africa . viewing the wide range of animals up close on this moderate sized park was awesome .be prepared for a rough ride on hilly roads .overall , an outstanding experience . </DOC> stayed for two nights in the middle of the world cup en - route from cape town to pe . absolutely great across the board . </DOC> the hotel is very nicely located , nestled between green hills of the golf - court and the coast .the surroundings are absolutely stunning .this time we booked two nights in a club room , on the third floor of the main building .this , honestly , was a huge disappointment and not worth the extra money .when we entered the club lounge around 5.30 pm , the bottles of wine that were placed on the buffet were almost empty and there was hardly any food left .only shortly before 7 pm a staff member came by to restock the bar/ clean - up .besides the snacks and drinks one would expect coffee / tea and mineral water being offered during the whole day . </DOC> this establishment is well located .an approximate 15 minute drive from the airport and right by the sea .the staff were friendly and very helpful .the rooms are spacious , well appointed and excellently decorated .the hotel area is peaceful and allows for a good rest .the bed was comfortable and as a result i had a good night \'s sleep .the breakfast was delicious .the golf cart for ferrying guests around the hotel complex is a good addition .i give the hotel 7.8 out of 10 .'
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'Love the hotel and the location is in a great location with a lake view to the valley in the main area. A very good choice for a family of 4 and 2 adults and 3 children who are in the area for a weekend break . Staff were very friendly and helpful , rooms clean , good facilities , good quality , however I would not stay again but will not be returning to this hotel .</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"very nice hotel in recoleta , a rich neighborhood ( mix of tourists and locals ) in the buenos aires .recoleta cemetery ( with a few restaurants close by ) is only 2 streets away ago .recoleta is in the center of buenos airesbut there \xe2\x80\x99s no subte ( subway ) in recoletaso you have to walk a bit to get to it .breakfast was good and the room was clean ( although a bit small ) .staff was nice , except maybe at night .hotel was very good for the price paid . </DOC> a really good hotel .i recommend you chose a callao suite which is like a mini appartment .great location , very nice hotel .the staff is attentive and good breakfast too .i would recommend this hotel for first time travellers to baires </DOC> we stayed here for a few nights while visiting buenos aires after patagonia .the hotel was located within good walking distance to the cemetery , downtown , restaurants and more .we were able to walk everywhere .there was free internet in the business area and breakfast was nice with a variety of things to choose from .the people at the desk were helpful and the hotel was very clean and comfortable .the rooms were large and quiet . </DOC> it is nothing special despite the ambition to be 4* but comfortable and with an expensive but very good italian restaurant on the ground floor .breakfast is reasonable with furit , eggs and many types of pastriesbut if you check out early they do not provide even coffee which is poor service .there are other restaurants nearby according to budget - the one next to the beaux art museum is very good .nb to see buenos aires use the open top tour bus sometimes called the yellow bus .the agents are very reluctant to give details as they want to sell live tours and object to the use of audio tapes on the bus .it is hop on hop off .one stop is quite near the hotel by the recoleta cemetery - also a must - see ! </DOC> this hotel is a rare find : one that lives up to its own description .the rooms are quiet , comfortable and roomy and equipped with an amazing array of powerpoints to charge up all your various devices .the staff is very helpful and also very unobtrusive .it is perfectly located in an elegant district and the italian restaurant is first - class . strongly recommended . </DOC> friendly staff at this conveniently located hotel .rooms were clean .breakfast was good and was included .excellent but expensive restaurant for dinner , seems to be popular with the locals , reservations are recommended .no swimming pool . excellent massage .good hotel close to the cruise terminal and national airport for flights to iguassu falls . </DOC> stayed in this very nice hotel on our last night .the room was spacious with a very good bathroom- pity the water was only tepid forcing very quick showers .staff were friendly and welcoming .it did have that city hotel soulless feel to it . dined in the restaurant for convenience , it was a little formal which was inconvenient as we were left with few clothing choices at this point and felt underdressed .the menu is a bit quirky in that the dishes are priced for two sharing , the food was good and the service excellent .it seemed that the diners were regular locals which is always a good sign .breakfast was extensive a tasty , but most of the people seemed to be business travelers so it was a less relaxed atmosphere . </DOC> the hotel is located in the heart of recoleta .the room is nice and well decorated but the bathroom is too small .the hotel is only 2 blocks away from recoleta cemetery and recoleta mall .there are many nice restaurants and shopping places in the area .this is a really beautiful area and we feel very safe walking around even at night time .the breakfast was great even not a big selection but the quality was good .the staff were just ok .they are not particularly friendly or helpfuland that 's the best they can do"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'Been here before and it is a great hotel with very good value for money. the room was clean , the bed is comfortable but the breakfast buffet was not good . there are no restaurants within walking distance and we had to take a taxi to find places to eat , food and service . We did not eat at the hotel , staff were friendly , good food , good value , good .</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEW:  b"we drove through il calafate last night to this hotel just 10 minutes walk from the town .it consists of various ' houses ' each containing a number of individual rooms ( ours was quite a walk from the main building ) which are set in lovely almost japanese - style gardens with some interesting ibis - like birds who seem to be resident here .the rooms ( we had a suite ) are extremely spacious and ours had two double beds .the bathroom had all we needed with a bath and overhead shower combined , bidet and nice bath products .comfortable beds and lovely monogrammed towels which we thought was a nice touch .there are two restaurants in the hotel .one is called the club house and has a little bar .it was good but not exceptionalbut i would certainly recommend it .</DOC>"

SUMMARY:  b'I originally picked this hotel because it is located in the middle of the city centre with many dining choices nearby . Our room was spacious and well equipped . there were all the staff were helpful and very helpful , the rooms were spacious , staff were friendly and helpful , staff were helpful , the buffet breakfast , buffet style , a bit of a walk into town but we were able to walk to a supermarket . A lovely place</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"the pictures of the updates look like a great addition to a lovely property .staff was helpful as alwaysstay in the ocatilla area , if you can . </DOC> this is a lovely resort with beautiful grounds .the place oozes of history & a very rich heritage as the grande dame of arizona .no one can take that away from this property .the bathrooms are quite smallbut the room was over 500 sq ft . & very elegant .but really ? a keurig ?i also found the amenities in the bathroom to be quite limited .yes , they have the brands signature ferragamo line . </DOC> from the room itself( i had my own patio ) to the fitness center , i wish i had more time to explore the property and simply hang out and relax .i was here for a work function and was enamored by the beautiful grounds and landscape .my team was also able to witness the lighting of the christmas tree on the front lawn , complete with snow and santa .minor complaints would include not having a coffee maker in the room but there was a cafe close by where i could easily purchase one .another small issue was one of the toilet roll holders was off the stall wall and on the floor in one of the bathroom stalls in the women 's bathroom by the conference rooms .i thought that these bathrooms could have been a little better kept . </DOC> stayed here three nights for work and stayed in the ocotillo area of the resort .rooms are larger than average for the area .ocotillo area has light breakfast , afternoon snacks , and desserts at night .i had help from carlton at the front desk who fixed a parking issue for me .decorated for the holidays . </DOC> spectacular vintage property that is well maintained .the hotel has lots of buildings and you may have to walk for a few minutes .not a big deal .the restaurants and bars were full of action and open .the chilled pools were great to take a dip in at night and are open 24 hours .my room in the valley view building was huge , had great air conditioning and a loaded mini bar .you need to call for ice and they deliver right away .the main bar had great wines by the glass and a special features wine .staff was great .the valet is much easier and the garage is about a 5 - 10 minute walk to rooms .they did have a golf cart shuttle running guests to rooms when i arrived .you can walk it .great deals on hilton mvp site for summer ! </DOC> pros : very nice hotel with a sprawling campus .the brunch was awesome and highly recommended .terrific service by the hotel staff which were very friendly .cons : the main pool had blaring music , almost like a club .the golf course is not part of the hotel .there was no service to take your golf bags1000 ' feet across the street .the staff did not know about the amenities of the golf course .you can walk or drive across the street to play one of the two courses which are very nice .i thought this hotel was going to be relaxing and a golf resort . </DOC> i was really impressed by sheer size of the property and also the fact that it was so close to the airport and in the city itself , once could easily walk to the shopping places nearby, it was like a totally different , plugged out of city experience .they have a huge choice of pools including a big water slide that seemed like a lot of fun .there was a decent set of restaurant options insidei must say the food was excellent , the salads were amazing and to my surprise the hotel had even organized indian food that was pretty awesome !i loved their fitness center - had some great cardio and strength equipment , i probably spent a lot more time here than i had planned for .the staff were very courteous and their service was superb !i would like to pass on my thanks to the wonderful staff who made the experience fantastic ! </DOC> i thought the property was very nice .well groomed and very pretty to look at .& i could not enjoy the property to the fullest .our meals were very well done with good food and even better service .the room was larger & very nice .very nice staff just not enough to handle the guests timely .frank & alberts was nice to eat at .ask for a room in the main building if you want to be close .the cottages looked nice but some are a long walk to the main building ."
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'my family stayed in this hotel for 2 nights in March and the staff were very helpful with the local restaurants. Its a great location as it is in a good location with many restaurants and bars in the same room . I stayed in room 302 which was very nice , the rooms were nice and the gym was very nice but the pool was not as clean as I expected , but the staff are all great . would recommend but i dont know why they have excellent location but i think you get what you pay for</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEW:  b"other reviews are accurate in terms of employee friendliness , room size , etc .i had two issues with my stay , however , keeping me from rating this property a 5 : first , the carpet in my room was not clean , as evidenced by the drinking straw on the floor in front of the bathroom sink and the white debris scattered about the carpet everywhere .second , the hot breakfast buffet had mediocre ( and not so hot ) omelette - like egg triangles and yogurt bowls completely empty .they never did get refilled while i was in the dining area .the location is goodbut i ' ve had great stays around the corner at the marriott suites and hyatt place, so i do n't think i will be back to this spot .</DOC>"

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"other reviews are accurate in terms of employee friendliness , room size , etc .i had two issues with my stay , however , keeping me from rating this property a 5 : first , the carpet in my room was not clean , as evidenced by the drinking straw on the floor in front of the bathroom sink and the white debris scattered about the carpet everywhere .second , the hot breakfast buffet had mediocre ( and not so hot ) omelette - like egg triangles and yogurt bowls completely empty .they never did get refilled while i was in the dining area .the location is goodbut i ' ve had great stays around the corner at the marriott suites and hyatt place, so i do n't think i will be back to this spot . </DOC> this is our second trip to scottsdale , last year we stayed at hyatt place , this time we decided to try hyatt house and we were pleased with our choice .the hotel is within walking distance to all the attractions , the suite was huge , more like an apartment with a full kitchen and separate bedroom , we asked for a quiet room away from trafficthere is a nice pool and plenty of seating areas , free breakfast and parking were a bonus .i highly recommend this hotel . </DOC> as a travel pro at dm vacation i always rate hotels based on their advertised quality .this hotel certainly has met and exceeded what they advertised .the hotel has a very good location if you want to walk around and explore old scottsdale .within walking distance to restaurants , bars and shopping .their was ample free parking and the hotel was very busy .normally eggs are offered and it is easy to work with that .the rooms are large and comfortable .the room layout works great for a single or people that are family or a couple .if they offered a screen that would make this perfect .but i did not hear any at night </DOC> booking this hotel was the best thing about our recent trip to scottsdale - the rooms are nicely decorated minisuites complete with full kitchen and a living room and bedroom ( both with wide screen tv ) - the best thing was the staff in the breakfast area though - they busted their butts everyday making sure the large number of guests were well fed and taken care of .our best hotel experience in the last 10 years </DOC> excellent hotel right in center of old scottsdale district .two level motel style built around a small pool area and main hotel building .very spacious and well appointed rooms / suites including full kitchens .staff very friendly and helpful .very good free breakfast included in price .in good position for old town shops and restaurants etc . , and short drive to major shops and other attractions .would highly recommend this hotel if you are staying ion this area . </DOC> the hotel is situated about a 5 - 10 minute walk from old town scottsdale and is convenient for most of scottsdale 's golf courses and shopping .the suites are very well equipped although not huge .breakfast is good with a range of hot dishes and omelettes made to order .the pool is a little small but perfectly adequate with loungers and tables surrounding .a half day rate for late check - out is available , very useful for night flights back to uk .all in all the hotel represents excellent value at the rate we got of $ 95 a night . </DOC> excellent living area for entertaining .great breakfast , location , bed , staff , breakfasts .nice bar & lounge areas .cons : air conditioning unit was a bit quirky , getting colder ( and then warmer ) than it should have .hyatt is doing an interior remodel on the entire facility over the next year : new beds , carpeting , including the public areas . </DOC> stayed here recently and was happy .would n't hesitate to go back .the property is located very close and walking distance to old town scottsdale and many other restaurants and bars , shops , etc .helpful front desk staff , allowed us an early check - in , which was great .we got a good rate .i would certainly return here without hesitation ."

SUMMARY:  b'Love the hotel and location of this property is ideal for a short stay with the young lady who runs every time you need to do it. Hotel is well maintained and clean with good gym and restaurant/bar (very good value for money). Would stay again but next time we have stayed in The Beefeater for \xc2\xa310 a night and it was a good deal too & the rooms were clean and tidy & had a great reception</DOC>'
