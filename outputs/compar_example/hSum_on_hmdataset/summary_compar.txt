ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"we stayed at the strand on the way into yangon , and the governors residence on the way out .wish we had done the reverse because it was 2 nights at strand , and only 1 at the gr .the gr also has lush gardens and is much more scenic .the room was not as large as the strand , but was a very decent size .overall , my recommendation between the 2 would be the gr , even tho the breakfast ( which was alacarte ) was better at the strand .also closer to the airport so less travel time in a crowded city . </DOC> and it was by far the best hotel we stayed inand i ' m guessing the best in myanmar .it is just so relaxing to turn into the driveway at the end of a day of shopping or touring and just immediately relax .the service in the hotel was excellent and the breakfasts were absolutely delicious - loved the signature omelette .i would definitely stay here againand i ' m sorry that our stay was n't longer . </DOC> siam bangkok , trisara phuket , howies home stay chiang mai , and 137 pillar house chiang mai .stayed at this hotel for two days before departing for mandalay .surprisingly good hotel considering how new luxury tourism is in myanmar .the staff was professional and helpful .they have an excellent selection of cuban and dominican cigars .the breakfast is great .the service is professional and friendly .we have a beautiful governors suite with a patio looking over a lilly pond .if you are staying in yangon i would highly recommend this hotel . </DOC> the place is very luxurious and clean .service is friendly and attentive .our rooms were comfortable and were equipped with all the necessary amenities and a mosquito net covering the bed .the breakfast is very tasty and there is plenty of food with a local touch .staff were very helpful arranging a smooth and convenient stay .i do recommend booking a table at the ( ground floor ) restaurant instead of the buffet on the first floor as the restaurant is more romantic and the food is better . </DOC> the governor 's residence is a little out of the way but it is a beautiful hotel with an excellent staff and a very good hotel . </DOC> i travelled in myanmar and stayed on my own in yangon for 5 nights of gentle sightseeing before joining road to mandalay .i selected the governors residence as it was in the burbs , had a garden and pool and 2 restaurants .i had in mind that i could sightsee and then relax in lovely surroundings and be able to eat on my own with a view of the garden etc , rather than with my nose in a book or stuck with room service .this was the perfect choice .staying here was a real treat from the moment i arrived .my room was fantastic , on the ground floor settled in the grounds , i was very comfortable . </DOC> we definitely saved the best for last and was pleased that we did things in this order .certainly the most luxurious place that we stayed in or so in myanmar .not cheap but what do you expect .value for money ?we thought so , but everyone has a different take on value propositions . </DOC> staff and great colonial / burmese atmosphere but with everything you would find in a 6 star hotel .each day there would be a free activity for guests e.g. , tour of local art galleries a tour of , chinatown , cocktail party to minge with executive staff and fellow guests .everything you could think of was available at the breakfast buffet plus an egg / pancake station with individual cooking .the hotel is situated in the diplomatic quieter part of town with gardens and a large pool .we were grateful we were away from the hustle and bustle and traffic jams of down town yangon ."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"i stayed here a couple nights and must tell you that the entry is magnificent with extremely high ceilings giving an open feeling and seating for relaxing and meals for the restaurant .the service was impeccable provided by the bell hops , concierge , front desk staff , room service , restaurant , and hospitality staff .it 's in a good location tucked between shwedagon pagoda and the grand central station .you can find good rates on the travel sites .take advantage and be amazed !would n't be the best if you need to work .the connection is the worst i experienced in yangon . be advised !put the computer away and get onto your vacation ! </DOC> this is a substantial and modern hotel with large public areas and well - equipped rooms .very comfortable bed and good bathroom .the buffet breakfast was good by myanmar standards and never seemed at all crowded .the ground floor pool and its shaded garden was also never particularly busy and was a pleasant place to relax for an hour or so .it is easy to hail a cab to go downtown and the trip there should be no more than \xc2\xa3 1 - 2 with the same for the return .no meters are used so if you feel overcharged just suggest a slightly lower amount and this is accepted with a rueful smile .it is an easy walk up to kandawgyi lake although only parts of the boardwalk around it are currently open due to renewals in progress .so it is an annoying fault that needs attention . </DOC> the hotel is a little pretentious , with big spaces , but all of them a little cold .the service , they try to be nice , but they do n\xe2\x80\x99t know how .the rooms are nicely groom and very confortable .the location is ok , but with the traffic that happens in yangon , it \xe2\x80\x99s better you pay attention for your appointments . </DOC> and i think it is primarily pitched at the business and conferencing market .that said , i had a great sleep here for 4 nights and the pool was lovely .there were always enough loungers and the area gets the sun from around 10 - 4 .so i would definitely recommend it for lounging around in between sight - seeing .15 usd for what is not a great buffet is an absolute rip - off , likewise 24 usd for lunch .i did not think the quality was good andi resented paying 15 usd for 2 eggs ( luke warm ) and 2 bits of toast and some coffee that really did n't taste nice .the room service menu does n't have sufficient snacks on it </DOC> the hotel is clean and modern with spacious rooms featuring large windows and excellent bathrooms .the bed was comfortable and a large lounge chair was a great thing to have in the room .the staff were all excellent .the breakfast was good .other meals were reasonable though there was a limited menu and slow service . </DOC> this place left me cold .a modern monstrosity - bling - bling lighting , poorly - trained staff , and the most hideous pop - music ( might appeal to a 15-year old , but not cool for adults ) in the bar and restaurant .the staff did not even replenish shampoo and bath gel !english was very poor .only good thing to say is that the food is very good .fabulous breakfast buffetand we had a good dinner too .they could improve it by toning down the lighting , changing the music and training the staff . </DOC> i really liked the pool and the rooms were spacy .but the ambience of the restaurants and the bar was weak .the overall design of the hotel was disappointing and internet access not very strong .staff were friendly and polite . </DOC> big clean rooms , amazing breakfast and a really nice pool area . too far from town to walk , but only $ 2 fare in .i would stay here again on return ."

 "summary": "this charming hotel is clean and well - kept .the staff were all friendly and helpful , they have a good location with many restaurants , bars , restaurants , shops etc .a few steps in the centre of the city , which is too much to do in the area .views are beautiful but you are not able to get to the room and you can see the sea and sunrise .i would stay here again in the future .it is not a 5 star hotel but it would be good value for money ."



 ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"on past visits my only constructive feedback was the bar food and room service menu were poor .this is certainly not at all the case , and they ' ve made some great changes and the food was very good .service remains exceptional and a world class hotel for sure . </DOC> the hotel is located in their business district and is within walking distance to some malls .the room is clean and equipped with the necessary amenities , staff were friendly and helpful .it was a very pleasant stay and wished i had more days there ! </DOC> a good hotel . courteous staff , very good fitness centre , good restaurants and easily accessible transport options .connected to the coex mall and convention centre , so lots of options for food and shopping .internet access is good . </DOC> if you want to be close to coex center and several malls , then you found your place : stuff is very polite though not always equally efficient .rooms are nice but as typical for korea athmosphere is somewhat cold and strict .rooms fares are suprisingly affordable while eating options are surprisingly expensive . </DOC> i stayed at the coex intercontinental twice during a tour around korea , at the start and end of the holiday .i booked this hotel because i liked the idea of it being close to a mall and in a nice area of the city .i arrived at the hotel on the kal limousine bus from incheon airport , it drops you off just outside the entrance , and the hotel porters quickly got the luggage from the bus .the reception staff were very good , check - in was very quick , although we did have a few problems understanding their english .the room was huge and had a wonderful view towards the river .the bed , a large king , was comfortable , with white linen and a good selection of pillows .a phone to rent , the air - con was very simple to operate and above </DOC> this big hotel at the coex convention centre is centrally situated in the business district of seoul .with a beautiful view from the frontside on the old temple complex , it is showing the beautiful mix of old and modern seoul of today .the rooms are a bit old .the quality of the bed is good but bit firm .the bathroom is old and of 3 star quality .the lobby is ok and the restaurants have big variety of food .the breakfast is good .on the top floor there are nice restaurants and bars with spectacular view .generally the staff is friendly and helpful .the value of this hotel is too low for the money you pay .room rates and prices for drinks and food are really too high . </DOC> lovely hotel even for a chain ... actually it has a lot of charm .from the piano music in the afternoon in the lobby to the light jazz in the evening , it 's a great place to sit and enjoy a bite to eat or just relax .rooms are spacious and with good views . excellent service . </DOC> rooms are jaded ... near old .location in fantastic , with duty free shopping right on your doorstep .coex mall is huge ...you 'll have fun right there .a train station is also nearby so you can get to anywhere with no issues .airport bus service gets you to the doorstep .question on security though ...nice rooftop bar for that evening night drink with nice views ."

    "summary": "this new hotel is in a good location just off the main street and near the airport .it is a short walk to the historic center of town .rooms are spacious , with a large flat screen tv in the room .the location was very convenient for the airport and the metro station next door ( walk - in , bus ) to the local area , absolutely nothing to do with this hotel .very convenient location - close to the old town and the ferry - "
