ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'Clean property and very helpful staff. Location is great, a steakhouse located on one side and a buffet on the other. Has airport shuttle service. Lots of shopping in the vicinity: outlet mall, Sam\'s Club, Cracker Barrel, movie theater, gas stations etc. </DOC> This is a nice HGI but it could use some tender loving care. The location is excellent to restaurants and Bass Pro. I\'ll stay here again on another trip thru. The staff was also very good at this hotel. </DOC> Rooms on the I-20 side were incredibly quiet, given the traffic on the interstate. Rooms were very clean and well kept. Grounds are well lit, and with ample parking. Staff is very helpful and responsive to requests - and they were on point the night of the tornado warnings by helping to assist customers with refuge. Good bar and breakfast. </DOC> I have stayed at many Hilton properties including the Hilton garden inns. This property was okay-- nothing exceptional. My first room was not cleaned when I opened the door to start my stay. It appeared the previous guest from a "PIG" so I returned to the lobby to get a new room. The location is good with plenty of restaurants to choose from in the area from fast food to Longhorn Saloon & Grill is next door so you can walk. The staff was pleasant, but appear less energetic than any hotel I have stayed this year. The team member who hosted the breakfast ... she was great. </DOC> as with all Garden Inns\', you cant go wrong here either. Easy location right off the freeway with plenty of shopping and restaurants right next door and across the street. The rooms on the freeway side are pretty noisy, but my a/c fan drowned out that noise. The staff were all very helpful and friendly. I loved the X-finity TV service and big Visio LCD TV! I wish all hotels would do this. Note that there\'s NO bar/grill at this location, except for breakfast in the morning. However, a 100-yard walk next-door is a steakhouse with full bar/restaurant. Bonus - There\'s a big Outlet shopping mall and a Bass Pro store 1-exit to the west! </DOC> Hard to go wrong at an HGI, and this one does not disappoint. With an excellent location near lots of chain restaurant dining options, its perfect for busy business travelers and over-nighters. Desk staff was efficient and polite. Breakfast was pretty standard, but above average. Business office was very user friendly which can accommodate printing, scanning, flash drive use, etc. This was very helpful, as some locations do not offer scanning which requires bugging the front desk folks. Some have complained of the highway noise, and sure enough I had a room overlooking the highway, but personally, I\'m lucky enough not to be bothered by it. Pretty clean room, comfy bed and plenty of space. Wifi is also pretty good. </DOC> Stayed here twice this wk & had a king both times. I\'m a Garden Inn regular & have probably stayed in at least 50 of them across the couintry. For some reason the "dial a bed" that Hilton uses on king beds in the Garden Inns was very uncomfortable in both rooms I had this wk. Pool is also very small by hotel standards. Service was very good but make sure you request an "odd numbered" room as the even numbered rooms are literally on the shoulder of I20 & are very noisy. </DOC> The hotel is nice, but it\'s located right next to a very busy interstate. Rooms along the back of the hotel, including their most expensive rooms, are extremely noisy with road traffic that never stops. Unless you can confirm that you are getting a room located on the front side of the hotel, I would recommend that you stay at the Courtyard Marriott or Fairfield located nearby by. Neither of them are located next to the interstate. I\'m a Diamond with Hilton - I checked out after the first night and moved to a different hotel.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"Stayed for the New Years Eve celebration and breakfast package. The hotel room was beautiful and very clean and modern. The restaurant attached BW had a great morning brunch. A little higher on the price scale but for the holiday expected. Very convenient location. </DOC> This is a lovely hotel, close to shopping and to the downtown area - just steps outside of the door. It's not on the strip where the shows are located (but, they are fairly close). The staff was very friendly, and the room was very nice. I would stay here again should my travels ever take me to Branson again. </DOC> I booked a suite for our mini vacation. Extremely beautiful suite!! Separate bedroom, full kitchen, huge bath with jetted tub and separate large shower. There was also a large balcony with table and chairs. Bed was a bid hard for us, but was comfortable. My husband and I enjoyed to the fountain show each night from our furnished balcony. Covered parking is $10 per day. Our 3rd floor suite was on the main street and was so very noisy. Traffic started very early in the morning and we were unable to sleep late as planned. Overall it was a very nice stay. If we visit Branson again will definitely ask for a room away from the traffic and on the river side. </DOC> I had a nice one night stay at the Promenade at Branson Landing. The check in went smoothly and the service was very helpful and friendly. The rooms were spacious and clean. It is a hike from the parking garage to the main lobby so it is well worth dropping off the bags instead of hiking them from the car. There is a fee for overnight parking in the garage. The room did not get as cool as I would have liked but it was still a nice stay. </DOC> From start to finish this was by far one of the best hotel stays ever. Paul, Ken, Tim and several others were attentive from start to finish. The hotel rooms are spacious and smartly appointed with warm colors and comfort. This will definitely be our hotel of choice when visiting Branson from now on </DOC> Stayed here for work holiday party. Large room that overlooked square. Room had full size stove, refrigerator, dishwasher, and was fully stocked with dishes. Comfortable bed and large Jacuzzi hot tub. Would stay again when visiting Branson. Loud music outside from shopping area but I did not hear after 10 p.m. </DOC> The staff is excellent! This was a great value when compared to other locations in the US. My room was large, well equipped and clean. Missing was an internet connection. Air temperature during my stay was easily managed. Branson has become a destination resort area and during the holiday season, it is extremely busy. </DOC> I have stayed at this property several times, but this was the first time to stay in north tower. The advantages include being closer to the main lobby and valet parking. However, I prefer the south tower with an outdoor balcony for evening meetings with associates. Elevators are efficient and staff is always pleasant."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"Stayed there twice in the last year and loved the place! It's warm, staff is extremely friendly, rooms are spacious and the hotel is classy and luxurious but not pompous. The hotel bar is out of this world! </DOC> Hotel room was nice and quiet and spacious. The lobby was constantly churning with wedding groups and business meetings (34 at one long table) - so having a quite conversation was not in the cards - tried on 3 occasions - twice in the afternoon and once early evening. The staff are excellent, but the poor waitress in the lobby area was working the bar, the tables and all the transients wanting a glass of wine to take on the bus - consequently my food was cold as we had a quick order and a long wait with it apparently made but waiting for delivery. She was trying to make everyone happy, but clearly needed help. Mentioned it to the manager when going for my car and then again when checking out - got a head nod, but nothing else - so who knows if they will fix this. </DOC> Lovely hotel as one would expect for a Ritz Carlton. Friendly helpful staff, great rooms, priced as you would expect for a Ritz. Close to the business area so convenient for meetings and easy drive from the STL airport </DOC> Excellent meeting facilities. Enjoyed the food variety (lots of fruit and other healthy options). Room was large and comfortable. All rooms appear to have a balcony (for best view, ask for a room on the front ... rear rooms overlook garage and busy road, but still quiet). Parking is convenient in the attached garage. Strong smell throughout hotel, but got used to it (carpets just cleaned?). Very good experience. </DOC> Like all the Ritz hotels a comfortable stay with lovely rooms and a great staff a safe choice in Clayton. Nice restaurant on site and another nearby. Room service also quite good. Would stay here again </DOC> At the Ritz, you expect doormen, you expect valets handling your bags, and you expect to recognized by your name as you stay there. When our business foursome arrived on Thursday afternoon, there was no one handling the doors and we had to unload our own bags onto the luggage dolly. BUT...once inside, the staff in the lobby was wonderful though, and Sasha, Tracie, Brandon and Sarah made up for the outside hiccups. We experienced incredible, personable service from those four from the Club Level and Concierge Service. I can easily overlook the hiccups in our arrival. I would highly recommend staying here. Sasha, the Operations Manager is incredible and an asset to the Ritz organization. </DOC> Given the low room rates compared to other St Louis accommodations and especially compared to virtually any other Ritz, this location is a real find. It's a classic Ritz, with the dark-paneled lobby bar, marble guest room baths, and eager-to-please staff. The only slight complaint was that the valet staff were too interested in talking among themselves to welcome guests properly or tone down their language (and content, for that matter), for the families within earshot. But they were a minor exception to an otherwise lovely experience. I wanted to stay longer. </DOC> First stay at a Ritz ever, and it was a very nice experience. The lobby was ridiculously nice and the staff are amazing. The beds were super comfortable which is always very important. Downside: The room has a dated feel. The shower had 0 water pressure so it took forever. The light in my bathroom also didnt work. Super expensive parking... and it's kind of far from everything."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"Great location.....hotel was new...clean and staff was friendly......there is a restaurant in the hotel but I went next door to a Jimmy John's sub shop....the bed was very comfortable but I was not a fan of the very small square pillows, although they offered both firm and soft.......plenty of plugins....bathroom had Bath and Body Works amenities.....towels were soft and plentiful....the ac/heat was easy to use and cooled nicely......rooms were quiet except for hearing the occasional noises from the floor above....overall wonderful stay and would stay there again my next trip through </DOC> Stayed here for a small convention. I was placed in a handicap room (no idea why) with king bed, flat screen TV, small fridge, etc. The bed was comfortable, the shower good, lots of channels on the TV, and plenty of wifi to choose from. Staff was helpful, although all checkins were late (possibly due to another meeting leaving that evening?). I had breakfast & supper at the hotel restaurant; prices were reasonable (for a hotel) and the food was decent. Bartender was very competent & friendly. </DOC> I stayed for 2 nights while doing some business at the university. The hotel was easy to find and was only 10 minutes from the campus. Check in went with out issue and I was in a nice, clean well decorated room. I slept great the room included a microwave & fridge. Pretty friendly staff although it seems a bit over whelmed. There is a great restaurant and bar on the 1st floor. I was disappointed that the parking lot was virtually with out lighting. All else was great, enjoy! </DOC> Easy access to Interstate. Rooms OK. Bed comfortable. Restaurant on site poor. After a long journey did not want to drive another mile to find food. Ate bar snacks that evening which were OK but nothing to write home about. The coffee in the reception area was not maintained and I had to ask the clerk to replenish it. She went into the kitchen and returned with two cups of coffee. The self-serve coffee in reception was not replenished. Breakfast should be the easiest meal to prepare, however hashbrowns looked and tasted as if they were reheated from the day before. This restaurant needs improvement. Unsure if we would stay here again. </DOC> Very nice hotel. It was impeccably clean, well organized, and located in an area handy to all you need in town! Staff was extremely friendly and willing to help. Food in the downstairs restaurant was quite good as well. This hotel is a great value, and we will stay again when in the area. </DOC> The hotel is about 18 months old. It is very well kept and the staff was very helpful. One night the entire area lost power. The staff did everything they could to make things comfortable. We had a large group get together in the Cafe/Bar area and were well entertained by everyone. The one drawback is that it is on the edge of town and away from the activities. Would definitely recommend the hotel. </DOC> I stayed here on my recent business trip through Missouri. This hotel is just east of Columbia and appears to be new. The room was very clean and everything worked as it should. The fitness center was good. The staff was friendly. One big plus was there were enough AC outlets for all my gadgets. </DOC> I was a little disappointed with the entire stay. This hotel is kind of out on its own. It's is fairly new and the room was large and cleanish. The sheets were quite worn. The staff was not really friendly the food at the bar was not good. Wish I had walked to the jimmy johns near by."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'This property exceeded our expectations. The staff is friendly, the rooms are clean and it\'s in a great location with an easy access to the interstate. I would definitely stay here again when in town. </DOC> Front desk is overworked with only 2 people and 5 people in line to check in. They were more than helpful how ever they did get my reservation mixed up with someone else. The room was nice but the carpet needed to be replaced, the hall ways were dirty. Now I will say this is a busy hotel so it would be hard to keep the halls vacuumed but at lease try to clean once a day. The lobby and breakfast area is very nice and the breakfast is good with real eggs and plenty of choices. All n all it is an ok hotel but overpriced for the condition it is in. </DOC> Always stay here. Looks like great lobby upgrade with a great breaky upgrade with Chef and eggs to order! Woo Hoo just like home. This place is huge and comfy beds and nice amenities in room. Chicago pizza they the lobby doors if u like that. We walked across the street. Lots of restaurants in walking distance too. Heard the rooms will all be renovated soon too so another woo hoo!! Till next time. </DOC> The lobby of the hotel is much more impressive than the rooms. We upgraded to a suite after they tried to put us in a room with a hot tub in the living area. not our cup of tea. The furniture was torn and only one TV worked. The bed was not the most comfortable. The outside appearance needs attention too. Staff was attentive. It is within walking distance to several restaurants. Will find another pet friendly hotel when in Joplin again. </DOC> This hotel has been updated since the tornado and they have really stepped up their game. I stayed in a King Suite, and the room was spacious. A large television screen in the room was great. Most hotels have a 32" tv, but this was more like a 48" class! Very nice La Quinta! </DOC> This is one the biggest La Quinta properties ive seen. The rooms are well appointed with a mini fridge and microwave. The beds were comfortable but the comforter looked a little sketchy. The highlight here is the breakfast buffet. Its well stocked with scrambled eggs, breakfast potatoes, sausage, fruit, cereals, juices and more. At 80 bucks a night this is a good value. </DOC> I stayed for one night in room 225. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The free wi-fi worked fine. I did not use the pool, but it looked inviting. The breakfast was great. The breakfast area is roomy and there were some good choices. There were regular scrambled eggs, or scrambled eggs with cheese and sausage. My only complaint was that out of 4 lamps in the room, only 2 worked. The 2 lamps on either side of the bed did not work. I informed them of it at checkout, so I\'m sure it will get fixed. I would stay here again. </DOC> First off, two stars is probably a little harsh but this La Quinta didn\'t deserve a third. We\'ve had problems previously with the hotels lining South Range Line Road in Joplin. The La Quinta was an improvement, but not by much. Our pet-friendly room was OK and clean, but the hallway had a nasty odor. The ice machine didn\'t work. We had a lot of traveling to do and wanted a reasonably early start the next day. We left the room around 6:30, too early for the included breakfast, so we can\'t comment on if we missed something. We\'re now probably one for four with Joplin hotels. Maybe we ought to rethink where we stop for the night next time.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"This is a nice hotel downtown. It doesn't have free parking, but there are lots nearby (one directly across the street) where you can pay $7 per night or they also have valet parking for a higher cost. You can park on the street overnight, but it's risky as after 7am you're supposed to have money in the meter. The hotel has nice rooms. They have WIFI that works well. Good comfortable bed. Nice amenities (basically a slightly more upscale than usual Holiday Inn). If you're staying for longer they also have a washing machine and drier which is coin operated so you could do laundry. I saw a pool, but didn't use it while there. Overall, I'd recommend it. A cheap price on priceline booked me the room for a few nights. Aside from no free parking, really nothing else bad about it. </DOC> Neat building and history but the essentials of the stay was only OK. Friendly, helpful staff. We had a king room on a corner of the hotel. The room was very small as was the bathroom - two people couldn't be in the bathroom at the same time. Nicely updated d\xc3\xa9cor, but we had a huge vent running through the corner of the celling, and when the fan came on for the air conditioning it was deafening! Had to turn the TV almost to the max just to hear it. Maybe more typical of an older building like that, but I tend to like the creature comforts more than the history. It was clean, and the dual-head shower had good pressure. I hate wimpy showers, so that was a plus. Be careful of the bathroom sink though - it has the same pressure and can surprise you and get water all over. </DOC> They made a mistake on our reservation and when we addressed it, they refused to correct it. The guy I spoke with said he would have to check into it and call me back, he never did. I had to make several calls before I was finally directed to some back office person and he was beyond rude. I reached out via email and received the same poor responsiveness with no resolve. This is a historic landmark in KC and I was involved in the revamp of this property. We stayed here a few years ago and it was a wonderful experience. Due to their horrid customer service and business practices, we will never stay at this property on special occasions nor recommend it to others at business or personal levels. </DOC> Valet parking was courteous and efficient. Check-in was fast and efficient. Elevators are small but FAST! the room was small, and the view outside my window was of a rooftop and several air conditioners, one of which ran continuously inches outside my window. The tv was good, lighting good, internet was good. Room service was quick, but don't get the chicken pot pie! (what was I thinking?). UGH! The staff was nice, courteous and did their jobs well. Lots of good places to eat within walking distance. probably wouldn't stay there again, it just didn't stand out as a great experience. </DOC> This 1925 hotel is small and quirky in a good way. The rooms are decorated for impact in bright modern colors. The location is excellent--within an easy 5 to 10 block walk are some of the cities best restaurants. We loved our stay--once we got moved to a king size room on the 6th floor. The first room they gave us was a tiny dark queen size room on the second floor from which all available light was blocked by a taller building very close by was something we couldn't accept. Would rather have been than at a Marriott, especially for the reasonable price. I'd stay there again. </DOC> This hotel has a great location for downtown KC. Great access to night life and restaurants. This is an old hotel that has been remodeled, however, the rooms are certainly fine. My only complaint about the hotel is the Internet Connection was unreliable and the lack of internet service for me, while on business, is very frustrating. The staff is certainly nice enough and they do seem sincere. </DOC> Booked this hotel through a last minute deal on Expedia. Promised a boutique hotel in Plaza area with at least a 3.5 Star rating. Didn't know name until I had paid my $70. Great value for that price. Renovated hotel. Good tv. Free wiFi. Wolfgang Puck coffee in room. Drawbacks: Very, very low ceilings. In room. In hallways. In lobby. Understaffed. Confirmation said to use valet for $16 per night. Never a valet person at door. Even front desk wasn't always covered. Breakfast buffet was $15 per person. Tasty And expansive selection. However there was a menu displayed but you couldn't order from it. Good deal. Good location. </DOC> This is a beautiful hotel. It's one of the smaller ones in the downtown area. The inside was breathtaking and our room was very clean. It was a little small, but that is to be expected in an older hotel. The bartender actually helped us learn a great deal about local attractions and recommended a nice restaurant. We will definitely stay at the Aladdin again the next time we are in KC."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"No complaints from this cross country traveller, weary from 16 hours on the road. For $85+ you get a decently sized room with a microwave and refrigerator, coffee maker, TV and free internet. You get a decent breakfast with eggs, sausage, biscuits, cereal, fruit and yogurt...and all the coffee you can drink. The towels and linens were fresh and the bathroom was clean with in-bath shampoo/conditioner/gel dispensers. The staff is friendly and helpful. My only complaints were a slight musty smell of the hotel and beds which were a little soft for my taste. Slept fine, though, as the place was quiet with no road noise despite being located right off the interstate. I would stay here again. </DOC> We had a good stay in a Pear Tree Inn in Kentucky, so we decided to give this one a try. We like being able to designate a ground-floor room and do not mind paying the extra five dollars to avoid climbing stairs. The beds, bathroom and furniture were all in good shape, and our room was quiet. Reception was very friendly. Now we have had two good stays at Pear Tree Inns, and no bad stays. </DOC> I am very loyal to the Drury chain. They have great employees and a good program that draws people in. This hotel is typical of a Drury with outstanding service. The only problem I see is that they are due for a new hotel in this location. This hotel is getting old and doesn't fit the new profile of the Drury chain. It is clean and well run. </DOC> I am a big fan of Drury Inns but this one is way below average. The price is much too high for this outdated and uncomfortable facility. The rooms were tiny, the gym is a joke and wifi slow. We checked out early. The staff is not to blame, they are courteous and helpful. </DOC> This place was a really good find. They had hot food in the evening - meatballs, pasta, salad, chili, baked potatoes, etc. The hotel was clean. Four pillows on each bed. Nice furniture. Thermostat on the wall to control heat and AC. Flat screen TV. Full length mirror. Everything was in good order. No smells. Friendly staff. Overall a really nice stay. Note that there is no elevator. We would definitely return. </DOC> I'd never heard of this hotel but found out it is part of the Drury Family. The room was very nice the bed was very comfy. There is a out door pool but the weather was cool and windy. The staff is very nice and helpful. The reservation staff did not know there was no laundry. But the night manager was more then willing to refund our room but we decided to stay any way and were glad we did. The breakfast was good. We will diffidently stay here again. </DOC> We stay at Drury Inns whenever possible. there wasn't one here so we tried the Pear Tree their sister property. I would stay at one again and recommend to my friends. Same high standards of cleanliness. The rooms were good. They advise at check-in that NO elevator so you are aware and they gave us first flour. They didn't have all the amenities that the Drury Inn does but the price reflects this. (no cocktails and hot food in the evening). Staff very nice and friendly. </DOC> Some hotels say they accept dogs, but they want to see a Service Dog Certification. We were delivering a Working Dog, Border Collie from Chicago to Oklahoma, and most places said no! The Pear Tree Inn was fantastic and the dog was happy, even slept through the night after a scary travel day for her. Lots of grassy area for play and to sniff other dog leavings! We want to return when we have no dog, because the rest of the facility looked great, but did not have a chance to use it."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"My husband and I first stayed at this hotel last fall and decided to stop here again while driving through Missouri this spring. Of three nights on the road, this was the best of our hotel choices - clean, very comfortable room, pleasant staff and nice breakfast. We will definitely stay here again. </DOC> My husband and I spent one night in this hotel. The room was very clean and quiet. The only tiny complaint I have is that the pillows seemed a bit tired. </DOC> We recently spent the night here before an event in the area. Staff very friendly and welcoming. Easy check in and check out. Popcorn available in dining area in the evening along with good coffee and hot water for tea. Although we left before breakfast began, we were able to grab some muffins and fruit to go. Rooms were very attractively decorated with nice up lighting and new nice bathrooms. New pillow top mattresses. Convenient mini fridge and microwave as well as single cup coffee maker. We never had to wait for the elevator but there were also wide stairs available. Convenient well lighted parking. A number of dining options within walking distance for dinner. Quiet for sleeping. Nice modern workout room and pool. A really nice place to stay. </DOC> This was a good clean hotel, exactly what one expects of a Holiday Inn Express. I stayed on my way to a business meeting in St. Charles, saving on congestion & money. Several restaurants are nearby; I ate at one of the Mexican ones which was average. </DOC> This is a great express hotel. Managers party from 5-7 with bottled beer soda and delicious snacks. rooms were spacious and comfortable and very quiet. Staff couldn't have been nicer. great location right off the highway. </DOC> Clean room, Clean breakfast area, well-stocked. Comfy beds. Good selection TV channels. Excellent Wifi connection. This is going to sound silly but it was ever so nice to have Toilet Paper where you can actually reach it without twisting and stretching! Kudos to the designers! </DOC> As a road warrior I always stay at the different IHG properties across this country. This property has friendly welcoming service, is clean, comfortable and consistent as we expect for a corporate national chain. Nice work. </DOC> Stopped here for overnight room was pricey but likely best hotel in area. Clean rooms slightly dated. Little confusing finding enterence as it share driveway with gas station and maybe Waffle House. Good location right off interstate."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'One of the better places to stay in Bozeman - good location, clean, quiet and helpful staff - though on this trip they committed the big \'No No\' - they gave me someone else\'s room, and yes, someone was already in the room... awkward at best, dangerous at the worst - things like this shouldn\'t happen, especially in a major brand hotel. They were of course, embarrassed to say the least but quickly remedied the problem... otherwise, a great place to stay at a reasonable rate. </DOC> Stayed one night. Room was fine but hit even when fan set to cool. Breakfast not up to much and service at breakfast only so so. Prefer the other local offerings. Online booking didn\'t work and ended up connected to an Asian call centre for ages to make the booking. </DOC> Another night in Bozeman and this time it was this property. Good airport shuttle and friendly & helpful staff. Room was clean and plenty of outlets for the tech. Air conditioner can run on fan for white noise should you require. WiFi was solid. Bar/restaurant only serves beer and wine... and menu was a bit limited however the food was good... Only one elevator was working which makes getting to the upper floors a bit longer. Pretty quiet. Lobby was good. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t have time for the workout or pool. Not much close to walk to if one is so inclined. Good property. A little TLC would be nice. I\xe2\x80\x99ll return. </DOC> A typical Hilton Garden Inn, located just off the interstate and not far from the airport in Bozeman, MT (once you arrive in the airport give them a call from the wall phone in the baggage claim area; they will pick you up in their complementary shuttle bus). This Hilton does not serve lunch, but shares parking lot with the Old Chicago restaurant that is quite good for lunch etc. In the morning, they offer a hot and cold breakfast buffet; one can also order off the menu. Overall a good place. </DOC> Spent the night here with my little brother because he had an early flight out of BZN. Clean room, friendly staff, well cooked breakfast, and a complimentary airport shuttle. There\'s a reason why I stay nowhere else in Bozeman. Keep up the great work HGI Bozeman </DOC> I got off my flight and onto the complimentary shuttle ready for another excellent one night stay. I left my car in the shop before I left so I had no transportation for the evening. Delivery was my only option for the evening. I asked the driver at the time (I wish I could give his name) and he told me that Johnny Carinos delivers. What a tip! Check out my review on that page for my experience. Thanks shuttle driver! About my stay, another quiet evening. Breakfast was hot and delicious. Business as usual. </DOC> Was here for two nights. When we checked in the front desk host completed our check-in but directed us to the wrong room. After returning to the front desk he got it corrected and we made it to our room. The room was clean and the bed comfortable. Both mornings we had the same waitress, Ashley, for breakfast. She was exceptionally nice greeting us with a "good morning" and fresh coffee. The food was cooked to order, good, and delivered to our table in short order. We enjoyed the experience Ashley provided. We would definitely recommend this hotel for travelers. </DOC> We were just passing through Bozeman, but enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Garden Inn. The hotel is convenient to the Museum of the Rockies with easy freeway access. The staff is friendly and the rooms are clean.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"It's 5 am and I'm sitting in the lobby waiting for a coworker, so we can depart for our early morning flight. The desk staff made up a to go bag for me. Thanks Dee!!! You are awesome!!!! Hotel is easy to find from the highway and sits right next to a very busy costco. My room overlooked the costco but I never heard a thing . </DOC> Very nice hotel with great amenities. Nice pool with whirlpool. Rooms were clean, quiet, comfortable, and quality furnishings. As with most Holiday Inn Expresses, the breakfasts are great -- love the cinnamon rolls! Restaurants in area are a little sparse (particularly if you want to walk). </DOC> We stopped here for an overnight stay while traveling. It was very clean and nice location. We had a good nights sleep. Free in room wifi. Free parking with just a couple restaurants close and also shopping was close. </DOC> As a returning guest to the Holiday Inn Express Hotel & Suites, we always look forward to our stay. We returned once again this summer, and were not disappointed. Everything was just as we remembered, friendly hotel staff, clean & spacious, comfortable & relaxing, morning breakfast met our family's needs perfectly. We will definitely stay at Holiday Inn Express & Suites, Bozeman in the future should we be travelling this way. </DOC> From check in to check out ALL the staff were warm and friendly. The room was immaculate, well appointed which made it relaxing. The morning breakfast was also in a very comforting area and albeit the usual fare, staff kept it spotless and greeted you with a smile. The only negative was in room 208, there was a pump or a fan in the ceiling that we did not notice until the night. </DOC> When I checked in, I was upgraded to a suite, which was made me happy. The suite itself was in a decent condition and the hotel was located relatively close to the airport. I was a little surprised though when a hotel employee made me wait by holding the elevator until her colleague came back from the lobby. Not sure that's the best service, especially that there were two elevators. </DOC> The hotel was well situated about 10 minutes from downtown, so very convenient. The rooms were clean and nicely appointed. They have a beautiful pool and hot tub area and a small workout room. All of the staff we encountered were very pleasant. On site laundry facilities. (fee) </DOC> My fiance and I stayed here for my best friend's wedding last weekend and it was great. I love the email confirmations and reminders with extra info. Bed was super comfy, quiet even though we were right by the elevator, and very nice and helpful staff. Continental breakfast could be better, but I know that is a holiday inn standard. They do have a great selection though of different bagels, fruit, etc. Close to town and the interstate, but far enough away so there is no traffic noise."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"This is a good place to stay, and ideally situated to visit the northern part of Yellowstone National Park. Restaurants are plentiful in the immediate neighborhood, and the entrance to Yellowstone NP can be reached in a few minutes. This lodge is no great luxury, but overall OK. Cleanliness could have been somewhat better, and the airco system is very noisy. But for the rest absolutely no complaints, on the contrary. </DOC> Stayed here for 3 nights last week while visiting Yellowstone Natl Park. Room was more than we expected. First there was a queen size bed in the living room so we each had a bed. Friend thought he'd be on pull out sofa. Felt like we had a little apartment. the kitchen was well stocked and everything clean. Bathroom very clean. Bed in the bedroom was spacious. Little saggy but fine. The room does get a little hot even with the heat at 65 ;) One night slept without heat on. Guy that work the front desk was very helpful and friendly. Even lent us a set of binoculars for our entire stay. Loved the views out both windows and also loved seeing the mule deer right outside. Felt almost like we were staying at a cabin in the park itself ;) would definitely stay here again. </DOC> When I asked for 2 beds I didn't expect 2 bedrooms! A fabulous location; literally 3 mins from the gateway to Yellowstone. The rooms are spacious with all kitchen facilities and a grocery store across the road. Super comfortable beds and absolute silence for a great nights sleep. Apricot tree growing right outside front door and deer and rabbits in the surrounding gardens! Perfect for a sleepover before heading into the park. Would definitely recommend it! </DOC> Really nice! Full kitchen with microwave and dishwasher, oven, electric range, TVs, sofa bed, tile in the bathroom, this place way exceeded our expectations. It's a block off the main street, so it's not too noisy yet is close to everything. We'll definitely be back next trip to YNP! Way nicer than your average motel room. </DOC> This is a nice recently remodeled place. We had a kitchen, living room, bedroom, and bath. It was roomy and very clean. When we arrived we were not sure what to expect-the exterior is alright but not as nice as the interior. If we are in Gardiner again-we would stay here. </DOC> The rooms are charming, very clean and comfortable. We stayed in Room 105 and have a nice view of the Gallatin Mountain Range (on a clear day). Staff is very helpful and accommodating. This place is ideal for 4 or more people. </DOC> The Inn is in the center of Gardiner and close to the Northern Entrance of the Yellowstone National Park. The room with a king bed was quite new and clean, everything (TV, fridge, hot water) worked just fine. A bench outside our dor was a nice extra. </DOC> I have stayed at this hotel several times! It is gorgeous and very roomy ! The decor is very well done. I love staying there. It is very reasonable for such a big room, really like an apartment with bedroom, kitchen and living room! I would recommend it to anyone!"

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'We had reservations and were arriving late after a 550 mile drive. Staff was very helpful and the room was just as presented on the website. We were pleased with the new room. Everything was basic except the television channel selection which was extensive. The clerk suggested the Montana Club just down the road for a late super. We went directly there and the food was excellent and the staff very friendly. I would stay at any of the new or newly remodeled Motel 6\'s as long as you check the TV channel selection when you make the reservation. Some have a good selection and others do not. </DOC> Definitely feel this Motel 6 is a step above others we have stayed at. Only 1 hitch and it wasn\'t a biggie.....but do watch out. I walked in and was told there were no rooms before being asked if I had a reservation. The young man at the desk was sirly and irritated me by telling me I was lucky that I was smart enough to make a reservation. Then he told the young lady (night desk person), "he\'s your last reservation and he\'s lucky to get a room". Tired and really not wanting to get into a discussion I told her he must be having a bad day. She smiled and said yes. Overall it was a great value. 2 queen beds for $53. Much better deal than we had had over the previous 4 nights. </DOC> Needed a room near Missoula Airport. This Motel 6 is cheap, easy to find, it has an inside corridor, is recently refurbished, has plenty of parking, and the two women on reception were super friendly even at something past midnight. What\'s not to like: a good M6! </DOC> Looked like the room had been recently re-done. It was tidy/clean. Liked that there was flooring rather than carpeting. Would\'ve liked some additional basics: shampoo, kleenex, hair-dryer. Staff was efficient. The toilet had so much pressure that it was LOUD like an airplane...tough to use during the night without waking everyone up. Hallways smelled a bit smokey even though our room didn\'t (thankfully). </DOC> Really a nice property with clean, modern rooms. Wi-Fi was really excellent which is often not the case in a budget motel. Minuses: one, the woman at the front desk was alone around 7:00 PM during the height of the tourist season (early August) and thus the line to check-in was 4-5 deep. She was quite efficient but the motel should have had a second person at the other desk station working to help speed up the check-in process for everyone......and two, there is no clock in the room. I don\'t like having to look at my cell phone to see the time. Oh, and still no shampoo in the bathroom but it will be provided at the font desk if you ask. </DOC> Stripped down to the basics but that\'s what to be expected for a Motel 6. Have to ask at the front desk for some shampoo and that is absolutely ridiculous. Towels could be better quality too. Room was clean. Price was excellent. </DOC> We have stayed here a few times before. Still a great hotel for the price. Room is clean and beds are not to bad. We really like there is no carpeting. The few draw backs are they don\'t supply shampoo, fridge and microwave. And they didn\'t have breakfast. Any time we wanted clean or extra towels housekeeping had no problems giving them to us. But for the price you can\'t go wrong. The area is perfect for what we need to do in Missoula. </DOC> a new hotel near the missoula airport. better price than those around it. since it is relatively new, nice room and clean. you will need transportation to get to university of montana or downtown missoula.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'I stayed at this property when it was a Comfort Inn. Once it became an Americ Inn, I stayed elsewhere. The original Quality Inn is now a Guest House Inn. Choice was lucky to get this one back with new ownership. The desk clerks are great. The owner is on site and the property is being updated. Beds and furniture will be updated, but not because they\'re bad, but the owner is willing to continue investing in the hotel. In a neighborhood of higher priced hotels, this one is a bargain. </DOC> The hotel is fine and the staff is very friendly. Exterior vinyl siding on a hotel is not what I would call quality and the room needed updating. The furniture was old and cheap, but the bed was excellent and the shower was fine too. The internet was slow and the breakfast was not quite up to par. If not for the staff, I would only rate it average. For a few buck more and a location closer to down town, I would suggest the Comfort Inn, which is excellent. </DOC> We found this place as one of the few with a room. We decided not to drive on to Glacier in the dark (good decision) and another motel suggested this place. Nice reception, and after a boo boo, put us in a "suite". The room was more than adequate but the place is showing it\'s age. Breakfast is a typical waffle, lots of breads, yogurt and cereal spread. Indoor pool. </DOC> I had a great stay at this Quality Inn. Spacious rooms. Nice decor. Walking into the lobby brought a warm, homey feel to it right away. The staff was amazing everywhere. The breakfast spread was very commendable. The only feature they lacked was a fitness center. Otherwise this place will be a great choice for future stays. If you are not a fitness buff, this place will serve you well. I also like it\'s proximity to many restaurants and shopping. Even Costco is just down the road. </DOC> We normally stay with a different chain but their hotels in Missoula were booked so we stayed here for one night. It was okay. Nothing to rave about. Room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Breakfast was basic. Staff friendly and courteous. </DOC> We stayed here for the EWU/UM football game. While not close to the stadium, the hotel was very easy to get to. The location was great -- right next door to The Montana Club. The rooms were fine, and they were clean. The price was right, especially for this weekend when most hotels in town raise their prices extraordinarily high. The breakfast was fine. There was enough to eat, and a decent variety of foods. The best part of the hotel was Liz at the front desk. Our window latch was broken so she brought up a tool kit and fixed it so we could have some fresh air. She was helpful finding a lost cell phone, and was always offering to help. Really enjoyed our visit. </DOC> This Quality Inn is clean, quiet and the staff were very helpful. There are lots of restaurants in the area ranging from Fast Food to a higher expectation place across the parking lot. We have stayed at many Quality Inn locations and this one was quite good. I think this QI has been updated, although the bath toilet and sink are very low and not elevated as they are in most facilities. The bed by the way was Excellent. We would stay here again, Breakfast was OK, although there were no biscuits for the gravy and the sausage was cold. </DOC> The hotel is located right off the interstate and has many good restaurants to choose from. We had a king suite and the room was very spacious,clean and the bed was super comfortable. They do not have an elevator so if you\'re staying on the second floor you have to drag your bags up and down the steps. They also have a room safe charge of $1.50 which can be removed from your bill upon check in or check out.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'We stayed one night at this lovely hotel. The room and bathroom were extremely clean. The bed and pillows were comfortable. The staff was very warm and welcoming. They even have a little basket at the front desk with mini candy bars! The breakfast was good, maybe not as much of a selection as others, but there were warm and cold selections. I would definitely stay at this hotel again. We stayed on the third floor. </DOC> Stayed here last year but found some nice updates including furniture and large flat-screen TV. Free evening snacks with beer, wine or soft drinks. I like the extra drawers in the room for storing clothes on an extended stay. And there\'s a refrigerator for keeping drinks cold. Several good restaurants are very close by. A night light on the hair dryer makes it easy to find your way to the bathroom for those middle of the night visits. Only fault I found was the caulking around the tub was not applied very well. Looks pretty sloppy. </DOC> While I only stayed here for one night, it will be a memorable one! I planned a b-day party for my best friend\'s daughter and we both came in from out of town. Tessa helped me arrange everything, from finding adjoining rooms, to allowing early check-in and even participating in the fun by giving out the "VIP party passes" when the guest of honor arrived!! The hotel itself was very nice, spacious and comfortable. The pool area was fun and while Tessa was absolutely the stand out from a staff perspective, EVERYONE there was super nice and accommodating! THANK YOU for a very nice and successful stay! </DOC> En-route to our Labor Day vacation in Wisconsin my wife and I make Kearney our first night\'s stop. The Country Inn & Suites is a good property and it looks like they may be doing some renovating. This is probably a sound idea as this motel sees a great deal of I80 traffic so it is starting to look a bit tired. None-the-less a well run property and great breakfast. Good location. </DOC> We frequently stay in Kearney as our half way stop between The mountains and home. We have tried many of the other sites but decided on Country Inn this time. The price was comparable and the room was very clean, updated, nice bed and quiet. I would stay here again on my next pass through. </DOC> It\'s a pretty normal roadside hotel with no thrills. But it was clean and king suite was spacious...so worked for it\'s purpose. Staff working at breakfast had a day off or they are just bored with their job. Breakfast itself was what you get on these hotels...far from gourmet, but gets you going for the new day. </DOC> This time we stayed in a one bedroom suite because my brother went along with us. It was very clean and comfortable. The bedroom had a door and was separate from the living room area that had a fold out couch. There was a bedroom between the two. It was perfect for our needs. The room and bathroom were extremely clean. The lobby was warm and inviting with a cozy fireplace and fresh baked cookies. Breakfast was awesome. You could have a made to order omelet or lots of other selections. I think this was better than the last time we stayed there. We would definitely stay at this hotel again! The only draw back was that the pool and spa were down while we were there, but not a big thing to us. </DOC> Stayed 3 nights and had 3 rooms for all of us, one being a suite where we could all sit and chat. We had only minor issues w/the hotel.....I hate spots on the carpet and furniture, but I guess w/the amount of people going thru during the summer......and the children running up and down the hall! Where are the parents? Also, posting notes on doors asking if guests would not let the doors slam. Oh my! Noisey AC unit, it adds water and then takes 2 more steps before giving cool air. So, to some it might have been quiet! The front desk could have used 2 people tho.....breakfasts were good, lots of parking, quick to all we needed in Kearney as well. We\'ll be back, top floor tho, end room!'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"Booked online for a good price. When checking in the clerk was very helpful. Due to club status I was upgraded to a suite without requesting it. The room was excellent. Roomy with comfortable king bed, flat tv, fridge, microwave. Bathroom was clean and roomy. Parking was not bad at all. Very happy with the experience </DOC> We noticed when pulling up that this was a new hotel. Very clean and friendly staff! The room was clean and spacious. Big bathroom! They have free hot breakfast, too. Enjoyed our stay here! Would stay here again. </DOC> Much appreciate a clean, quiet and comfortable room after a long day of work and travel whenever on the road. Moreover, it's especially pleasing when staff is friendly and the extras like a good workout room and a tasty breakfast are available. Highly recommend this Best Western property. </DOC> Newer hotel, only 2 years old. Everything is very clean and new. Two Queen bed room - Very roomy with desk, chair and a comfy chair with ottoman. Frig and microwave in room. Bath and body works products. Nice breakfast selection. Small store to purchase snacks. Staff was friendly! </DOC> We stayed here one night on our road trip from VT to WA. Very friendly staff, clean, comfortable rooms and common areas. Very spacious and located near the interstate, though it is back behind a car dealership (so it's quiet). We really enjoyed our stay, but wish the refrigerator had a freezer. </DOC> Great stay in Lincoln, Nebraska! I would not hesitate to recommend. Not too far from interstate, restaurants nearby, nice area, and a great room. The beds were comfortable for a great night of sleep. The ceilings are tall so your room feels spacious. We had walking room in our room and plenty of plugs for recharging gadgets. The bathroom was even spacious with high ceilings .... had a first floor room. Shower was good and the towels and bath mat were high quality for a hotel! Great choices at breakfast....gluten free, regular eaters, and even kid friendly choices. Bacon was even crunchy! See what I mean?. I would not hesitate to recommend BW Plus in Lincoln! Thank you for such a nice overnight! </DOC> This is a new hotel. Very clean and spacious rooms. The access is really easy off I-80. Exit 403, left at the stop light and right at the next stop light (between two car dealerships), follow the road back to the motel. I am giving the directions, because it is not in the\xe2\x80\xa6 </DOC> I stayed with family for a quick stay cation and was very impressed with the overall quality of this one year old property located in North Lincoln. Positives: New, new and New! Very nice rooms with high quality beds as well as amenities. Pool area is fine, with a good hot tub and work out room is located in the same area. Rooms are designed for high tech families with fast wifi and plenty of charging stations as well as a 42 inch HD TV. We reserved the 2 queen suite which isn't a true two room suite but it has a fridge, microwave and sofa with table. Shower area is good sized. Breakfast was more than adequate. Read the reviews as this is a true diamond in the rough for Lincoln, Nebraska located on the North Side of the city with easy access to the Interstate."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'The rooms were clean and quiet, and I felt that for the price we paid, it was a very good value. We\'ve stayed at two or three other locations in Elko, but I\'m recommend this Holiday Inn. Breakfast is very filling. </DOC> Great place to stay! Very modernized, clean rooms, quiet, free breakfast in the AM. The staff was very helpful and greeted us at the door. We were the last to check in that evening and they said they were "waiting for us to show". If traveling through here, I would stay here for sure. Close to restaurants, casino\'s, gas stations, and the freeway. No complaints - friendly staff, very willing to help out. </DOC> Elco is a long way from anywhere so we weren\'t expecting much.However the room was spacious and very comfortable with a settee and a chair,nice bathroom and a huge very comrtable bed that almost needed a ladder to climb up to get into bed.Breakfast was the only disappoitment-no fruit and very ordinary fare.Very close to Alderstones supermarket which has a very large range of food which you can consume in your room as it has a stove,microwave and frig. </DOC> I have stayed at this hotel 4 or 5 times in the past few years. This time I got a nice suite on the 3rd floor. The room was large, nicely furnished and decorated, A/C worked great and it had a large tub that I decided to soak in. I needed a nice room after spending 4 weeks in student housing at USU. The young man at the front desk who checked me in was very professional and efficient. Great stay and I am happy with HIE Elko. </DOC> Jun 2014: good welcome at check-in. There is no guest laundry here, but can use the one at BW sister property 1/2 mile away. Very loud door slamming on the nearby rooms. An older property, re-branded, not built as a HIE. Everytime, you have to hold down the toilet flush lever for a while to activate it. Main entry to lobby is via two heavy wood doors (no auto openers). Breakfast was out of orange juice and low on other supplies. Also, no refer or micro in our room, which for this price range, was unusual. </DOC> We spent 2 nights on way to and from the nearby Ruby Mountains (which are fantastic!). Suite was large, clean and had nice fridge, microwave and Kurig coffee. Bed was comfortable. Windows open and nearby freeway is not too loud, but mellow sounds of trains passing are soothing. Temperature regulation on AC was a bit wonky, according to my wife, who\'s fussy about AC. However, bathroom had magnifying mirror, and window opened, 2 pluses for my wife. Breakfast was standard for HIEX. I always like the hot cinnamon roles. </DOC> It is along way across Nevada on this route. Towns are few and far between. We were so surprised to find this town and all the name brand hotels it had. Since we are IHG members we always stay at this properties. And I must say this one did not disappoint. Front desk staff that checked us in was very helpful illite and friendly. Thanks for a great night. </DOC> We travel frequently by car and always look for Holiday Inn Express. We spent the night at the HIX in Elko, NV. and got exactly what we were looking for and clean, quiet and spacious room at a good price. Excellent service and then a breakfast to start the next day. Definitely a great stopping place.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'I have to agree with most of the reviews. A nice property and the staff was just great. Especially keeping in mind that this is Las Vegas. I enjoyed not being in a casino hotel for this trip. The only negative for us was that the walls are thin. Noticable sound from the next room. Guest there seemed to think that you have to yell into a cell phone. Sound problems from other rooms is not typical for HIX </DOC> This is very new property. It\'s clean and nicely decorated. Breakfast is good. However, I got problem with wifi in my room. It did not work all night. Quite upset. Also no floor mat provided in the bathroom and I had to stand with wet feet on tile floor. </DOC> An older Inn which has been upgraded to meet HIX standards. It qualifies but is wearing quickly, Close to the "Strip" with transportation. Rooms are crowded and halls are narrow. Breakfast area was dirty (more the guests\' fault than the staff\'\'s). Unless you want to be in Vegas, keep moving up the road. </DOC> This is an average Holiday Inn Express. We were able to get a good price for the rooms and the location was great for us to be able to walk over to the Mandalay Bay. </DOC> I have never been let down by a Holiday Express and this is no exception. An excellent night sleep with late check out was perfect for our road trip. The staff was very pleasant as a bonus. A bit spendy but it\'s worth it when you want peace and quiet. The only downside as in all hotel chains is jailhouse breakfast. </DOC> We stayed here one night before our flight early the next morning. The staff is great, very friendly and helpful. The shuttle service to Mandalay Bay was very convenient and much easier then trying to drive and park on the strip. The rooms and lobby were very clean, the hallways seemed a bit dated, but overall, a very clean, nice place to stay a night. </DOC> Here, the pros outweighs the cons so it was a good value overall, recommended Pros: near Strip, fairly quiet, has good breakfast, good service from staff, easy parking, free wifi, clean bath and room Cons: a bit dated, small rooms </DOC> We arrived in Las Vegas late in the evening on our way to Death Vally, CA. We didn\'t want to spend big bucks for a hotel on the strip since we were just passing through and found this hotel that\'s only a block off the strip on the better end for $114 with tax for a very nice king room. The bed was fantastic and one of the best showers ever. Wifi was good and the free breakfast bar was good also. If you want to stay in Vegas without the high price this is a great alternative.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"Very basic rooms with all the normal thinks you would expect. TV, A/C and free WiFi are the main items. 2 queen beds in the rooms. At $27.00 a night don't expect much more. The Jacuzzi jets were broken near the Bldg. #1 which was sad but it was winter time and probably normal. Ice machine is located near the Jacuzzi and not at the hallway for the rooms which was strange. But for the price it as fine. </DOC> Great deal ham steak and eggs for $4.99 what a deal. Very good so much we had a ham sandwich the next day. Very good flavor. We liked it so much we stopped again on our way back with the same great results - highly recommend. </DOC> Ashamed that we have not reviewed this place yet. Been staying here whenever we are passing through for around 5 years. Great rooms and LOTS of them. 2 Pools, guest laundry that is affordable and we LOVE the casino. Cocktail Waitresses are friendly and attentive. Just everything you could ask for. PLEASE read some of my other reviews.......I am NOT a push over. When a place is disappointing, I am not afraid to say so. Stay here and enjoy for yourself!!!!! Almost forgot. Whatever building that we have been placed in, the internet is fantastic. </DOC> I enjoyed the hotel rooms cleanliness and central location in town. No extra frills to mention, but the breakfast buffet was very tasty and good quality. The casino was very not modern and the clientele was dirty and dressed like slobs. </DOC> We were back in Mesquite for a family wedding and the Virgin River Casino Motel was my family's request to stay, eat and play.. Although was had a lot of stairs or a slow elevator to get to our room it was worth the stay. All the rooms are close to the restaurants, the Casino and believe it or not BOWLING! It is very family friendly for a Casino. </DOC> The area was clean and not too crowded. Little sandy and a ways to walk to the casino. We ate inside and enjoyed stuffed bisquits which were delightful. Not sure would sleep in the back area again though </DOC> I don't need to add to the many previous posts. It's not a great place but hey, what do you expect for $27? We thought this was a good stopping off place on our trip. The bed was very hard and uncomfortable. The room was very basic and utilitarian. You could brush your teeth, use the bathroom and go to bed and lay there all night. It was fun. Sort of. </DOC> We stay at this hotel every year when we visit relatives in Mesquite. This time we stayed two nights. Due to time constraints we had to book over a weekend when the rooms are more than the usual $27. Nevertheless still a reasonable place to stay. See my previous reviews--nothing has changed. The room was basic but satisfactory. Great deals at the restaurant--prime rib in the evening for $6.99 and breakfast specials in the morning for $3.99 and $4.99. Great deals for the money and we can't see any reason to stay elsewhere."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"This hotel is close to the airport, not on the strip and located close to shopping and many restaurants. The staff was great, rooms clean, breakfast hot and good, and it is easily accessed from the interstate. We had a one bedroom suite with a pullout sofa bed and appreciated the extra room and two TV's. Maybe it needs an update here or there, but all in all was a great choice for us. </DOC> Stayed here from March 23 thru 26th. I hotel is in a commericial area of Reno south end of town. Only a few minutes drive to Peppermill and Atlantis Casinos. I have stayed at many Homewood Suites and this in on par with the rest of them. The hotel isright off HWY 395 but is very quiet and not much traffic. The hotel is clean and service is good. Dinner is provided Monay thru Thursday with a hot breakfast. The breakfast seemed like it came out of a box and not made fresh only downfall. I would stay here again </DOC> I travel for work, Hilton properties are my go to hotel. Shout out to the front desk team, can't remember names but they were all very nice. Stayed in 2 different rooms, first was 203 (right next to the elevator) - had an issue with the very loud refrigerator so they moved me to a suite. Suite number 328 was very spacious with two separate bedrooms. Great prices and in a safe part of Reno. Bad news: Rooms are dated and in need of new carpet (no big deal) but the floors are paper thin and you can hear every pounding footstep of those above you. My advice is either book a top floor or don't stay there. I will not book there again (light sleeper). </DOC> Firstly, the staff at this hotel are amazing. Lot of fun, takes a joke, always a smile. Upgrade was glad given from a standard two queen to a full blow 2 bedroom suite. So, you might be asking why not a 5 star review? Cold showers and a very long walk to the room. Besides not being able to get warm water (even after 10 minutes of running the water) it's a long walk with a lot of bags to the entrance to the elevator and walk down a long corridor to another really long corridor. TV's were new and most everything seemed to be in good shape minus the carpets. I dunno, I loved the staff...but the cold shower...it really irritated me. I will also note the hotel is a mere 9 minutes to the airport, which makes this place extremely convenient. </DOC> This Homewood fell right in line with what I figured a Homewood in Reno would be like. The reception staff was ambivalent, and that attitude carried forward all the way through the entire stay, unfortunately. Not that it was a bad stay, mind you, but it was just... meh. </DOC> We stayed at this location for a antique car meet and tour for five days. This location was central for our sightseeing and worked quite well. The complimentary supper was good and worked into our schedule. The 4th floor picked up noise from the room top AC, but there was little traffic noise. The layout is very nice and spacious. We got a super deal on the price due to the group rate. </DOC> Great value for a really nice suite. The hotel is not on the main drag or in the center of town (it's in a business area) but the price is subsequently very keen and the area is safe and quiet at night. However, downtown is 10 minutes drive and all the stores, malls and restaurants are pretty close. The rooms are super clean and modern with a well-equipped kitchen and living room, a good-sized bedroom with a really comfortable bed and a nice bathroom. It was so quiet at night that it seemed that we were the only people staying in the hotel (which was far from the truth!) There was a good choice in the morning at breakfast and a nice breakfast room too. It was a good choice and a change from tacky casinos - recommended! </DOC> The hotel is a little out of the mainstream, but you have all the amenities that make this a pleasant stay. The hotel is very clean, ample parking and a very nice comfortable quiet nights sleep. You will not be disappointed."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'We have stayed here before and have always had a good experience. Staff is friendly and always well organized. The location is next to a major freeway and large post office so there is some noise. Breakfast is limited but lots of options nearby. I would recommend this hotel as a good stopover location when traveling through Reno. </DOC> Have stayed here a few months back and was happy with the room and hotel staff. This time, Staff was nice but not as helpful as before. They are digging up the parking lot and was very noisy, pounding etc. And it smelled. When we got in the room, it was not kept up like before. It was clean to a point but you can tell they did it in a hurry. And the room smelled like oil and asphalt. We dealt with it. I don\'t believe we will come back to this hotel. </DOC> We spent one night here on our way from the west coast eastbound. The room was very nice, with updated furnishings, a nice large table with chairs, and good amenities. Room could definitely use more outlets, though; it was hard to find enough places to plug in our laptops. Once we located these, the wi-fi was excellent. Great HDTV. Comfy beds with nicely dressed with bright white linens and TONS of pillows. Not the greatest location for restaurants but close to Costco. Breakfast was a under-par compared to what we\'re used to at other La Quintal locations with fake coffee creamer, no hot items, and lots of pre-packaged "white carb" items. It seemed obvious that they were trying to keep costs low, which makes sense since the rates were quite reasonable here. Would definitely stay again if in the Reno area. </DOC> We stayed one night here during a cross-country road trip with our toddler. This is a very average hotel in every way, which was somewhat surprising for a La Quinta, as I expected it to be a little more premium. It\'s an older property that isn\'t aging well, with fixtures and amenities that are rapidly getting tired. In terms of cleanliness, while we didn\'t encounter anything terrible, neither the rooms nor hallways could be considered spotless. Still, the price was right so we checked in, went out for dinner, came back to sleep, and left quickly the next morning after a cold breakfast in the lobby. If I\'m ever in Reno again, I might consider staying at one of the casino resorts instead - they\'re not that much more expensive. </DOC> The staff was excellent and check in took just minutes, Room was clean and well stocked with bathroom supplies. The beds were harder than I like but for the value still a great deal. Have a huge pet area and good location for freeway access. </DOC> This was the perfect location for our visit with family. Downtown Reno and shopping/restaurants are within 15 minutes. The near-by freeway made it easy to travel to Lake Tahoe. Our room was clean, comfortable, and quiet for a location near a freeway and airport. Breakfast choices are the usual for La Quinta. Staff is friendly and helpful. </DOC> The outside of this La Quinta looks rather sad and could use some fresh paint. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Our room was quite clean except for a half consumed can of beer in the refrigerator. The freeway noise was prominent, so we kept our fan running all night to drown it out. The room had a small window and was rather dark. Since we left at around 4:30 or 5 am two mornings to go to the Reno Balloon Race, we only got to try the breakfast once. It included waffles, hard-boiled eggs, apples, bananas, bagels and cream cheese, cereals, and the usual drink offerings. More than enough for us. The price we paid for the three nights we were there offset most of the problems. </DOC> My wife and I stayed for one night. The room was very large, clean, and had excellent a/c and a very good shower. It was pretty quiet but at some point in the night someone arrived on a motorcycle and idled the engine for a while which was very annoying. The breakfast was good. Staff were nice and friendly. The hotel is located right off the freeway and close to downtown.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"We had two rooms that were adequate.No fridge or microwave and the room was on the small size. Bathroom was very good and the beds were very comfortable. Construction on-going but only on the exterior. The breakfast was very good and despite the hotel being sold out food trays and coffee urns were replenished regularly. Check in and check out was very efficient and hotel staff were very friendly and courteous. </DOC> First off ... the front desk was amazingly swift at my late night check-in and the morning breakfast room crew was tops - the vittles were hot, plentiful and there was a bounty to choose from. Now about the renovations - exterior is being re-insulated and re-cladded. Nice. Inside, the rooms need a bit of help. Being at the intersection of 2 interstates (I-93 & I-89) means the hotel is very popular. The rooms are worn, furniture, carpet, and bathrooms. Good things: There are enough outlets for your gadgets, and great TV and internet. Freshen up the place - make it 100% non-smoking, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be back! </DOC> I was with a group at this hotel for a weekend event. The staff was friendly and very helpful. Breakfast was good. This was my second stay here as the group held a function there last year too. Cookies at check in were great. Hotel is right off the interstate. I would recommend the Chinese restaurant across the street. </DOC> We stay here when in Concord, NH. It is well located for highway travel. There is a good Chinese restaurant across the street. Clean and comfortable rooms. Good selection at breakfast and good room rates. </DOC> When I heard my mother had booked a block of rooms at the Hamton Inn, I was frankly worried. I more often stay in Westins and was worried what I would find. I was pleasantly surprised. It's not fancy, but the hotel was well maintained and looked as if it had been renovated recently. The beds were comfortable and they offered a free breakfast buffet in the morning - nothing special, but a nice option if you're on the go. Easy access to the highway and plenty of parking. I'd call this a stopover hotel, not a place you'd choose to book a vacation. Caveat - there is no restaurant or room service in the hotel. If this matters to you, look elsewhere. I would stay there again if I needed a place near Bow. </DOC> I am a big fan of the hampton inn and this property did not disappoint. However the helpful staff made this property exceptional...upon arrival, the desk clerk noticed that i had groceries and gave me a room with a fridge, which I very much appreciated. The bed was clean and comfortable, in-room coffee, good water pressure, free parking and delicious free breakfast. The location was also convenient to the interstate. Well done! </DOC> I stayed here while in Concord on business. Well run property, convenient to both the interstate and to downtown. Clean, normal Hampton breakfast. Staff was friendly. Not much around so plan accordingly. </DOC> Standard Hampton Inn. Quiet, very comfy beds and feather pillows. Great breakfast, free Internet at a good price. Concord seems to be one of those towns that goes to sleep at about 8:00pm so if you are looking for good food, bars etc then probably best stay in Manchester. This town is dead. It's peaceful though and well located (the hotel and area)."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'Smallest Springhill room I\'ve stayed in. TV remote was absolutely gross. Note to housekeeping staff. Finger-sized hole in wall right above head of bed a bit alarming. On the plus side, staff at front desk very friendly and professional. Easy shuttle access and printing of boarding passes are a plus. Lots of lobby remodeling going on but noise not a problem overall not a bad choice but there might be better at this ptice point. </DOC> This property looks brand new from the exterior, but the wear and tear on the inside leads me to believe that it isn\'t that new. There is nothing wrong with the hotel, but there is a cleaning issue. My room just wasn\'t as clean as it should have been. There was hair on the bathroom tile, and a fairly large cobweb in the window. That one floored me, although it wasn\'t a spider web. It was more of the dust bunny variety. Otherwise, the staff was friendly, and the exercise equipment was quite nice. I would probably stay here again, but I hope that some of the cleaning issues will be addressed. The hotel is 3.5 stars for its category of hotels. </DOC> Very convenient to the airport with 24hr shuttle. Since we were flying out early the next morning, we returned our rental car the night before and the shuttle took us back to the hotel. We requested a 4:30am shuttle and it was ready and waiting for us when we checked out at 4:15. Comfortable, clean room. </DOC> Easy to find, quiet, nice room overall. Very typical for a springhill suites and no major issues. Breakfast was good and not over crowded. The pool is indoor and the workout equipment was in good shape. Queen beds instead of full size would have been perfect. </DOC> This hotel is so accommodating whenever we use their Park and Fly Package. With the $10 a day parking fee at the airport, we choose to stay here for one night and get up to 14 days of parking. The staff is always so pleasant and helpful. We really feel welcomed. If you have an early morning flight, like we often do, they will have some breakfast items out as early as 4AM. Last winter when we returned from a trip, there had been lots of snow. Someone on the staff had shoveled a path to the driver\'s door of our vehicle. This was unexpected and greatly appreciated. </DOC> We like to stay at this hotel when we travel as they have a 24 hour shuttle service and free parking for up to 14 days when you stay overnight. Whenever we have an early morning flight, we come the night before, stay, and take the shuttle early the next day. The hotel is very accommodating to early departures, and they put out several food items starting at 4AM. This way, we can get a bite to eat before leaving. Being close to the airport, it does not take very long to get the shuttle when we return from our trip, another aspect that we like about this hotel. </DOC> The toilet in my room was the most disgusting toilet I have ever seen in a hotel anywhere. Under the rim was black with crap all around. The worst cleaning job ever and it was evident it hadn\'t been cleaned properly for some time. This prompted me to look around closer to this property, as it use to be one of my favorite stays when I fly out of Manchester. May move over to some of the Hilton properties and see if their cleaning staff can do a better job. </DOC> We had a reward night and were in the area so picked this to give us a little more room. The room size was decent but note you may get double beds. I missed this in my reservation but it is what was booked. Room was fairly clean. Sofabed as a little dirty (typical couch crumbs). Pool area was decent. Could use a coat of paint around hot tub to refresh it a bit. The entry system did not work after 10p.m. because "it thinks it\'s after 11". Simple fix I\'d think. Free breakfast. Kids liked the waffles. Eggs were not good. Sausage was ok but in water at the bottom so that was sort of a turn off. Plenty of coffee. I\'ve stayed in the area before at other Marriott. This was similar so it will be considered again.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'We sold our house in Flemington and needed a place to stay the night of the closing. Hampton Inn was perfect. Friendly staff checked us in efficiently upon arrival. The room was clean and well appointed. Breakfast was sufficient and tasty. Just what we needed... no complications! </DOC> We enjoyed our stay at this hotel. Very friendly staff, hotel is clean, beds are comfortable, no noise either inside or outside of hotel. Breakfast was good. We would stay here again and recommend the hotel to other travelers. </DOC> We had worked with this hotel for several months to reserve a block of rooms for our wedding. We had an afternoon wedding and asked the room block coordinator if we could get early check in for a few rooms so the wedding party can get ready. We were told that it would not be an issue. The next day when we checked in, the associate at the front desk told us, rudely, that no rooms were available. He seemed agitated by the fact that we even asked. It took several minutes of back and forth before he reluctantly gave us a conference room to change in. I understand that early check in cannot be guaranteed but we should not have been told that a few rooms wouldn\'t be a problem. Plus Steve at the front desk needs customer service training. Glad to see other wedding parties got everything they wanted. Wish we could have too. </DOC> I\'ve stayed here a few times and had the same room two weeks in a row. After the first week, I reported that some of the lights didn\'t work. They weren\'t working the second week either! As a HHonors member, I usually receive water at check in, but every time, they just hand over the key. I\'m assuming that loyalty to Hilton doesn\'t matter here. The elevators are down a carpeted hallway making it difficult to transport luggage. Rooms are dated but clean. Breakfast was the typical Hampton fare. I will continue to select this location, especially now that I know to slightly lower my expectations. </DOC> This Hampton Inn, is clean, nice location and the staff was friendly. I was disappointed on the Breakfast, the room did not has a frig or micro wave and there is no "business center" to print out boarding passes. I guess my expectation were too high for the rate I paid. </DOC> Recently had an extended stay for business at the Hampton Inn Flemington. Excellent stay great location. Staff was so friendly and welcoming. Fantastic complimentary breakfast both hot and cold choices and the breakfast team went above and beyond. Easy parking although sometimes full when adjoining IHOP is open. Would absolutely stay at the HI when in the area again. </DOC> Staff is amazing, pool and whirlpool are both nice and the complimentary Hampton Inn breakfast is always nice. The hotel could improve a few details - Internet is slow, towels at the pool are barely bigger than a hand towel, there are no plugs on one side of the bed, there is no refrigerator (you can ask for one thoigh), safe or closet in the room (only a small Armoire). </DOC> Standard Hampton Inn amenities, featuring relatively new properties (I\'d judge this one to be 8-10 years old), compact exercize and swimming pool area, nicely appointed lounge and TV room, and a well appointed breakfast bar with healthy choices and substantial fare. Easily found off of US 202 in the southern part of Flemington, it is about 1/2 hour from Princeton, Trenton, and then to many parts of NJ via the NJ Turnpike. Adjacent and attached to the hotel is a Perkins restaurant with a direct doorway to the dining room, open late into weekend evenings.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'After staying at several other Staybridge Suites, I was a tad disappointed in this property. I realize this is not an upscale hotel or area, but the "suite" was a fairly small room that we could barely move in with the sofa bed open. All three of us couldn\'t see the TV from the sofabed and the regular bed at the same time, and the breakfast was typically blah. On the plus side, the staff was friendly, and the location was fine. Next time I\'ll try somewhere else. </DOC> Chose this hotel based on Trip Advisor reviews and glad I did. Stayed for 2 nights to visit friends in the area. Enjoyed a spacious 2 bedroom/2 bath unit with kitchen area that was reasonable considering the area and the size. It was really comfortable and we would have enjoyed staying longer. Bed was extremely comfortable. Had some problems with the sink, but wasn\'t worth complaining. Staff members were very nice. Guests a few rooms down were very noisy in the halls, but once our door was closed we didn\'t hear anything. If we return to the area, this is the only place we would consider staying. </DOC> Friendly reception. Public areas and suite were spotless. Carpet in suite showed some wear. Very spacious suite. . </DOC> Great location near Wholefoods , Traders Joe and plenty of restaurants . But the traffic is a nightmare . Not a great location if you like to walk or run . The staff was mostly friendly . The hotel is clean and so was the room . Nice place to stay will go , I will go back if in the area again . The breakfast is not so great but you have a nice kitchen . </DOC> A very large 2BR suite @ 149 + tax which included breakfast, and light dinner and drinks. 2 bathrooms with perfectly good showers. A 5 min drive to the subway to get to Philadelphia. Both cities had easy subway systems to get to places. I do not understand people who don\'t check out the transportation options while traveling to a big city.( We are from Wisconsin ) A wonderful hotel staff, very helpful. Full kitchen in which we did not take advantage of , but there nontheless. Free laundry facilities which I\'ve never seen in a hotel before. Easy on-off freeway which is nice. Many dining options within 1/2 mile, many in walking distance. All in all a great place to stay and my compliments to the staff and management. </DOC> we stayed at the hotel- 2 adults,2 children. everything was excellent- we got our money worth! it is close to Philadelphia, to 6 flags only 40 minutes. the staff was very polite and directed us to the shopping center, to find the cheapest prices for dinner. breakfast- delicious. we will come again if we are in the area! </DOC> We booked a 2 bedroom suite at this hotel . The hotel was in a quiet area and the property was very clean. Rooms were spacious and very clean. Beds were very comfortable. We were baby sitting for our 6 month old grandchild while her parents were attending a wedding in mount Laurel. Even the small child was very comfortable..and she was very happy. We were very much at home ! The breakfast buffet was very good also. We recommend this place any day !! We would love to stay again. </DOC> Had a nice time again. Hotel room is adequate and love the fact we can have our own kitchen inside, with small children this makes it a huge plus. The pool was quite a bit colder this visit than our last trip.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"The Westin is right along Route 1 near Princeton University (10 minute drive). The hotel is relatively new and thus is up to date technologically which is nice. It is kept clean and there is plenty of parking. I would say it is middle of the road in terms of other Westin Hotels I've stayed in. The lobby is comfortable and has a cool vibe and there is a casual restaurant and a Starbucks in the lobby as well. </DOC> This hotel delivers on friendly front desk service and a comfortable room, but its a little on the drab side. Its the little details that add to this effect: slightly scuffed look in the hallways, somewhat dreary and institutional room appearance, less than perfectly efficient housekeeping (bathroom supplies, coffee, incompletely replenished), slightly indifferent service in the lobby bar at night (although they have some good wine). Its location, in Forrestal Village, is close to Princeton, but not right in it. It the location works for you, then the hotel will do what it needs to do, but my stay was not memorable. Nice gym and swimming pool, though. </DOC> The hotel looks as it should be nice, it is modern and clean. But the service has a lot to be desired. It took 4 calls to get extra towels. The pool was green, I mean LIME green. It only has a restaurant for breakfast. It is an ok hotel and I would go back. But it is not what I would expect from Westin. </DOC> We have stayed here annually for the last five years. It maintains high standards of service. Our room was well appointed and was both comfortable and spacious. The bathtub is on the small side but this seems standard. I would recommend this hotel if you are staying in the Princeton area. </DOC> The Westin group is more business oriented. Very quiet clean and comfortable rooms . The housekeeping is very efficient and friendly. The breakfast was good and decent. The hotel is a bit isolated from everything and the adjacent stores were mostly closed. Not much atmosphere. Overall a good stay and the hotel is well managed and lives up to Westin standards </DOC> The Westin at Princeton's Forrestal Village offers the guest Starwood Points or beverage credits for environmentally friendly behavior such as not having your room cleaned every night. My girlfriend enjoyed the lotions and other hygiene products that were plentiful in the bathroom. The hotel also has a run concierge, RunWestin, which maps out routes for runners to traverse while staying there. The hotel is located near some fine dining restaurants, Ruth's Chris and the Salt Creek Grill, and it has a restaurant on the premises, Parallel 40, along with a lounge. The rooms are spacious enough and well maintained. Parking is free and ample. I will definitely return to a Westin in the future. </DOC> An OK Westin except for the Club Floor which is a tiny self serve room with zero seating. Princeton guests deserve better than this for a club. I am Platinum and this club is appalling in quality. Breakfast in the restaurant was fairly good but that is full price ala carte so expensive, </DOC> Lobby and seating area of bar very open and modern. Rooms were large, but bathroom door did open out into area where sink located so awkward to pass when someone at sink. Did have a problem getting service at restaurant one night because only 2 waiters and one busboy. Seems a conference was there and attendees where also eating in restaurant so crowded at 9pm at night. On 6th floor we got bagels, muffins, fruit, and yogurt for breakfast to take back to room. They have a green policy of not changing towels and sheets everyday, but this also includes not emptying trash or taking up dirty glasses and replacing. We are used to that still being done and just towels and sheets not being changed. Confusing policy to us."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"We only stayed here one night as we were driving on a long trip...but you could tell it was a new hotel. Very nice, clean, convenient. Breakfast provided in the morning had a good selection and room for seating. The only problem was what I believe to be a new hotel design issue...the shower liner did not reach into the tub! Water was going onto the bathroom floor instead of into the tub! So we had to put in the cloth curtain as well to keep the floor from becoming flooded. We told the front desk staff because we felt bad about using their new cloth liner to protect the floor...and they are aware this is a problem. So, if you stay, check the length of the liner first! (they were supposed to be working on fixing this) </DOC> We usually stay in airbnb, but this was a real treat! The breakfast was superior- great variety and not the same everyday! The staff is wonderful; incredibly friendly and went out of their way to be helpful. We are impressed and would highly recommend staying here. The room was great. </DOC> We stayed one night at this hotel. The check in process went fast and we were really impressed with the room set up and cleanliness. This hotel is more focused on business professionals but was perfect for our party of three. The breakfast was great and we plan to stay at a Springhill Suites again. </DOC> Relatively new hotel and it's very clean. Very convenient location, close to I-40. Some restaurants and gas stations are nearby. Bed was comfortable. Room is somewhat divided with a desk and couch on 1 end, the 2 beds on the other end. </DOC> Hotel is surprisingly modern with lots of clean lined. Rooms were nicely decorated with West Elm furniture. I expected a clean hotel as it looked very new and I got what I was expecting. Bed in comfy. Nice with working area separated by glass from the \xe2\x80\x9cbedroom\xe2\x80\x9d. Working area also has a large sitting area with a trundle bed/couch, microwave and refrigerator. I opened the microwave one night after just going downstairs for a microwaveable dinner and was pleasantly surprised to find a plate and utensils. Room has a smart TV which is a nice touch. They serve free breakfast and staff is very friendly. Parking is free and they have a great sign with a cat crossing. There are several fast food restaurants within walking distance for a quick bite to eat. </DOC> We stopped here on the way from TX to CA. Good location, close to the interstate with lots of restaurants nearby. Stevie at the front desk was very hospitable and welcoming. The suites are very spacious, two beds plus the pull out sofa bed. Everything was very clean. Good water pressure in the shower. Good breakfast. And very nice staff. The in room heater / ac blower noise takes a little getting used to. </DOC> Facility is new. Clean. Rooms great. Location is just off I-40. Close to Rt 66. Very close to multiple restaurants and grocery store. Breakfast is very good. Internet TV is available. Use my Netflix account to view. The staff is exceptional. </DOC> Several people asked why we wanted to stay in Gallup, I said because it's convenient and has everything we need which is the same that can be said for this hotel. We only stayed one night passing through. It's a nice clean and modern hotel. It was good value for the class of hotel (probably because of being in Gallup). The free breakfast was good and had plenty of options. We ate at Smokey's which was an easy walk and a fine place to eat. It's also an easy drive to Wal-Mart Supercenter which was the first one we saw for several days on our two week trip. The only minor thing was the frosted window on the bathroom door, it would be nicer to have the option to be able to screen off the window."

After a little excitement upon arrival (apparently a warrant was successfully served, but it wasn\'t for us) we had a quick, pleasant check-in. We had a large, clean room (right above the lobby), comfy bed and pillows. Nice desk setup if you\'re working. Fridge and microwave came in handy. Not silent, but no noises out of the ordinary for a motel (didn\'t hear the railway out back, though it did pique my interest as I was gassing up next door). Lori checked out breakfast, but we decided to just settle for some coffee. No panhandlers, but with my appearance when I travel, they may have been extending professional courtesy. Found it to be a good value. </DOC> My husband, being budget conscience, selected this hotel for the last night out on our trip. He lost his hotel selecting privileges on this one. This is a poorly maintained property. I do not understand how someone in good conscience could rent a room like this out to anyone. The room we were given was dirty beyond belief. Someone had attempted to repaint the red color on the wall but didn\'t quite get the job done well. It had inadequate sound proofing and grime in all of the floor corners along with un identifiable filth on the walls. This hotel has been placed on our "never again" list. We do not recommend this hotel to anyone. </DOC> Nice stopping point between Flag & ABQ ~ as much as we enjoy the beautiful lights as you descend into Albuquerque on a night drive, sometimes we are just too tired & this Red Roof Inn in Gallup has become a favorite. Flat screen TV w/lots of channels, fridge/micro, free wifi with good signal. Room is clean and beds are comfortable with decent linens & actual fitted bottom sheets. A great value ~ not fancy but certainly much nicer than your usual "bargain" motels. If you want a real breakfast you\'ll probably want to plan on visiting a restaurant, but otherwise it\'s obvious they are trying very hard to upgrade & maintain the property. Patricia & Vivian at the front desk deserve honorable mention ~ wish all Red Roof Inns were this clean & staffed with such friendly & helpful personnel :-) </DOC> How did this place ever get a top ranking here? I wonder if many of the reviews are from shills? This place is only a few hundred feet from the transcontinental train track that have trains passing constantly blowing their whistles. I felt like I had to lift my legs in bed so the trains could get by! Also, it is nearly as close to I-40 so you get stereo noise from trucks and trains. Upkeep was also horrible. We checked out after 1 day and went to the much nicer and far quieter Best Western Inn & Suites down the road. </DOC> First, the staff at the desk were lovely and friendly. The room was a bit small but tastefully decorated and clean. Cable tv offerings a bit slim but the shower and bath were fine. My biggest complaint is the poor soundproofing. We could hear someone coughing in the next room and people walking overhead. Our companions were in another room and were kept awake by a loud, angry fight taking place in the next room. The breakfast is continental and the breakfast room is actually the lobby. Breakfast food poor. It\'s reasonable but not a place I\'d stay again. </DOC> If you traveling between east to west it is a good stop. Clean room .Old but have the necessary for 1 night. Confortable beds. Spacious room and good location on Route 66. I only dislike a smell.of cigarrete in the room dor non smoking. But all the hotel with 2 or 2.5 stats have this problem in NM , AZ and TX. I consider stay here again. Very good value for your money. </DOC> The room looked newly redecorated. Everything was fresh and clean with lots of good lighting (if you\'ve stayed in a hotel with just a few CFL lamps, you know refreshing this is!). A fridge and microwave are provided. The working/desk area was super, but the wireless speed was s-l-o-w. Good location, just off I-40 but near the train tracks. It seems like every five minutes a long train ran past. One minor point - the light switch for the bathroom was outside the room. We don\'t see that very often in our travels. Would stay here again.'

SUMMARY:  b'nestled in a big and well maintained hotel that has been recently refurbished and the room was very clean but the staff did not seem to know what they were doing .breakfast was good with plenty of coffee & tea & coffee & tea facilities , also plenty of free parking , a little bit of a walk to the beach ( but there is a bus stop on the river ) .</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"Easy to locate and well-positioned in Roswell, the Fairfield Inn and Suites proved to be a great choice and reliably convenient for Marriott members traveling on business. The king suite was roomy and clean; furnishings and finishes in like-new condition. The room was quiet and cool and provided an essential respite from the Hades-like summer temps. The staff was welcoming and cheerfully provided helpful information about the surrounding attractions and restaurants. The fitness center, while small, was clean and well-equipped for its size. Breakfast included the requisite hot and cold offerings and everything seemed well-stocked and quickly replenished. This is a solid hotel for all types of travelers and the best in the area at an affordable price point (the hotel website offers many discounts ranging from AAA to Government). Highly recommend and will return. </DOC> We stayed here to visit Carlsbad Caverns and the famous Three Rivers petroglyph site on the west side of Sierra Blanca. Viewing the alien encounter kitsch was fun, too. The staff here were charming and open to conversation, which helped us learn about the region. The hotel has discount coupons for several nearby restaurants, and it is close to the visitors center and museum in Roswell. </DOC> Another road stop motel. Not better or worse than their equivalents which you find scattered all over the US. Service was good. Rooms were clean. Sleep quality was good. Breakfast was as expected. Nothing else to add. </DOC> This is a typical mid range hotel... rooms were clean and service was friendly. Street side is a bit noisy with traffic sounds but that's to be expected on the mail street of town. Continental breakfast was typical. </DOC> On my way to Dallas and decided to see Roswell. I got in late and went straight to the hotel. My check in was great. The young lady that checked me in was awesome. She gave me great information on the museum and made sure I made it in time! She recommended a very good restaurant right beside the hotel. Room was clean and nice. I would stay here again. </DOC> We have stayed here many times. The rooms are fresh and roomy. Bed is comfortable. Rooms are visually appealing. Motel is quiet. Always good customer service. Free breakfast is adequate but could use an egg station. </DOC> We are pretty picky about hotels and the choices are pretty slim in Roswell. But business brought us here again and we chose the Fairfield Inn for the second time around. And again, it is a surprisingly good solid hotel. No missteps, no hiccups; just a clean comfortable room on Main Street. The am staff working breakfast work hard to keep everything up and running shipshape. The front desk staff...excellent, friendly and spot on. Another sold Marriott property where the local people take pride in their jobs while working hard to make the customer feel welcome. Great job! </DOC> Absolutely awesome shower pressure. (That was the comment I wrote in my notes.) Nice sized room. Huge king sized bed that was really comfortable. It was close to town and in a safe area. Really nice staff. Enjoyed it."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'Super nice people, very accommodating. A step back in time with improvements. Very comfortable beds, new carpet and clean bath. More work needs to be done to bring it up to excellent status. Upgrade the TV, repair or replace some paneling and just general outside maintenance. It\'s sad to see the Route 66 corridor in such bad shape, which in no way reflects on this property since they are trying to preserve the history. Kudos to them for that and I wish them all the best. </DOC> For a fraction of the cost at a chain hotel, you can you stay at this mom-and-pop motel on Route 66. It\'s a classic motor court motel with big windows and period 60\'s decor. The former owner was a rock hound, and he made the terrazzo stone counter and floors at the front desk from Mexican green "onyx" and the bathroom counters from colorful mixed stone slabs. The current owners are hands-on, running a friendly and clean establishment. While the property is no-frills, rooms do have amenities like free wi-fi and a mini-fridge. Rooms have been renovated but fully retain their old-fashioned ambiance. They allow pets for a minimal fee if you notify them in advance. </DOC> Try very hard to stay at independently owned motels and hotels and support local businesses. This one was a great choice. Cheery owner who appeared at the front desk immediately after we opened the front door and it was getting pretty late for normal check ins. Our reservation was in order, key waiting for us (a real old fashioned key on a motel key ring, not a plastic credit card style key :) Our room, No. 2 was just perfect for us. Very clean, no qualms walking around barefoot. Comfy bed. Turquoise chairs - perfect! Great retro Mid-century furnishings. Wifi was excellent, in fact worked better than any motel we\'ve stayed at in Tucumcari. Exactly what we were expecting and we had a great time staying here. We\'ll be back. </DOC> The room was clean, comfortable, and surprisingly quiet. Of course, it\'s outdated, but remember this is a throwback to the past and you should expect paneled walls! The sink is unusual. The shower head was probably the worst part; tall people will have trouble getting wet. There wasn\'t a blow dryer. The beds were comfortable and the room became cold through the night, even though it was too warm when we went to sleep. The outside temps were very hot that day. The on-site coffee house was fantastic. It had reasonable prices and you even receive a 20% discount if you show your room key. I would stay again. You can\'t beat the price for what you get. </DOC> We have stayed at the Historic Route 66 Motel in Tucumcari for several years now. It just keeps getting better. As a lover of Route 66, and someone who highly respects those rugged individuals who are working to keep the old route viable, this motel perfectly fits that bill. The rooms are spotless, service is excellent (they even recognize us after a year\'s absence!), and the price -- oh my goodness -- I would gladly pay much, much more to stay here. The guests are mostly families traveling I-40 or Route 66. It is so quiet here. Always a great night\'s sleep. Also, I love that you can have the AC on auto. Even more expensive chain places don\'t always have that AC option. The owners clearly are pouring themselves into this place. The love shows! </DOC> Unable to get into our original choice we were given the telephone number of this motel and it turned out to be an excellent choice. The room was large, clean and comfortable and was good value for money. The Free WiFi on occasion was intermittent having had trouble "logging in" on arrival. We did manage to speak to our daughter using the net only losing the connection once during the call. There is a small cafe on site that had live music the night we were there and it also serves as a breakfast area. I would use this motel again if ever in the vicinity. </DOC> We enjoy traveling Route 66 and this motel in Tucumcari will not disappoint. We were traveling with our dog and they allow dogs and have a great grassy area to walk them......they request you clean up after them which we did. The rooms are very clean, the beds are comfortable and they have microwaves and refrigerators in the room. The owner, Cathy was very helpful and pleasant. A great coffee shop on the premises. </DOC> We were on a road trip from Central California to Oklahoma for the Christmas holidays and stopped in Tucumcari on the way. We selected this motel based on Trip Advisor reviews and were very happy with our decision. This is an original "route 66" motel that had been renovated by the owners/managers two years ago. Being about 50 years old, the room was not overly large, and the bathroom was very small. However, the furnishings were very retro to fit the period. Importantly, the king bed was new and very comfortable, which was very much appreciated after a long drive. There was no hair dryer, but I aways carry one. There was a continental breakfast offered in the office, and the coffee was very good. The owner was very friendly and helpful about local information. We would definitely stay there again.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'Stayed here for one night before flying out from BUF the following day. Katelyn at check in was pleasant and gave us all the information for the shuttle and about leaving our vehicle. The room was clean and a fair size for a Fairfield inn. Breakfast the next morning was really busy but pretty well stocked all things considered. The airport shuttle was painless - took about 5 minutes to get from the hotel to the airport. I would stay here again if I needed a hotel before going away. </DOC> I stayed here for the Black Friday sale and it was good. They were very good have us a care package for the sale which was most helpful and the breakfast out all nite was very yummy I will be back hopefully soon. The shopping was good as well. Always a good shopping time in buffalo. </DOC> The complimentary kosher soft serve ice cream was a wonderful, surprise treat when we entered this Fairfield Inn. The room was comfortably spacious, breakfast varied and plentiful. Would gladly stay again when in the area. </DOC> I picked this hotel because of its location. Fairly new, and I have never gone wrong with Marriott hotels. Extra large pool , great hot tub. Usual breakfast flair, with added scrambled eggs. REAL EGGS!!!. Clean rooms and large restrooms. Excellant service at the front desk </DOC> Nice and clean hotel with fine breakfast and friendly stuff, nothing to be said against. Large parking, breakfast has even fruit salat (otherwise it is a standard US-hotel free breakfast), recommendation, will stay again. </DOC> First time at this location and enjoyed my stay. Had nice suite and consistent with other Fairfield Inn & Suites properties. The staff were helpful and friendly. Very convenient airport location. It is right across the street for the airport. The nice thing about this location that I have not experienced was that I was able to walk across the parking lot to their sister property the Courtyard by Marriott and charge my meal to my room. Nice touch. </DOC> Stayed one night here before a early AM flight and it was perfect! The staff at the front desk were "on the ball", professional and very friendly. Check-in was flawless and took 1 minute, no joke. The room was spotless and updated. They even have a ice cream machine in the lobby. They also provided a shuttle to the airport which was on time and the driver professional. We had a parking special of some sorts and parked our car there for 5 days for like $25. A perfect quick stay and will definitely return!! </DOC> Stayed here before taking a flight to Orlando . This time it was a shopping trip. Hotel was just as clean and pool was clean and warm. For those taking flights the airport is across the street. Breakfast was usual flair. Check in was quick and ladies were great. For those Canadians who need a fix Tim hortons is a 1 minute walk.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"This is a newer hotel, only a couple years old. Staff was very helpful - they let us check in early which was handy. The room is very spacious, with a dividing curtain so I could work while my little guy slept at night, and a full-sized fridge was nice. The breakfast offerings are good, with a nice sitting area in the lobby as well. There are plenty of restaurants and shopping close by, and it's quick on/off I-90. We'll definitely stay here again! </DOC> The staff was very friendly and welcoming and the hotel was fairly new. The rooms are spacious studios that have a curtain you can draw to separate the bed area. Full kitchen, shower stall. A little noise issue where you can hear the bathroom next door. And overall pretty clean. Good location near the Galleria and the airport isn't too far away. </DOC> This was our first time staying at this particular Home2 Suites, but we have stayed at two other ones in different cities over the past year. We were not disappointed! The rooms are very large and we enjoy the efficiency kitchen area. This particular establishment is near a mall and had many restaurants within a 2-5 minute drive. (It was extremely cold when we were there, or we could have walked to a couple of the restaurants!). I asked for an extra pillow when we got back to the hotel from dinner, and the young lady from the registration desk brought me one within a few minutes! Great friendly service! Would definitely stay here again if ever in the area. </DOC> For the price paid, this hilton property give one of the best value around buffalo. Its close proximity to restaurants and the galleria mall give this property and extra star for its location. Room is considerably large but not as yes as large as real suite should be. Breakfast options are simple but adequate. Great option to star at buffalo airport area with family. </DOC> This was my first stay at a Home 2 Suites by Hilton hotel. I have stayed in dozens of Hampton hotels in the past The Home 2 Suites by Hilton at 1999 Walden Avenue, Cheektowaga NY is located within a complex with multiple resturants and shopping locations including Cabela's The room was fitted with a kitchenette, including a refrigerator, freezer, dish washer, microwave and dishes and utensils The suite has a sofa bed and the bathroom has a walk in shower for your convenience There is sufficient parking within the complex. As a constant business traveler I would recommend this hotel and will plan my stays in the area utilizing this hotel in the future. </DOC> My wife and I stayed here on a shopping trip in the Buffalo area. We found the proximity to the Galleria area and convenient access to the Interstate very appealling. The property is new and the staff very helpful and welcoming. The free breakfast was above standard with home made waffles as well as cereals,fruit and yoghurt and pastries. It is aband new property and one we would come back to. </DOC> The room was clean and a nice size, especially when traveling with teenagers. The staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel is located right off of I-90 and close to a lot of restaurants and shopping. Only real complaint is that there weren't enough pillows for the beds. Would definitely stay again. </DOC> Located just off I-90 at exit 52E with numerous restaurant and retail stores, Cabela's is located next door, so if you have time it's a great place to browse for those outdoor enthusiasts. Located within the complete are restaurants from Panera Cafe's to Olive Garden and Bones, so you choices can change with each meal. The Suite is friendly and as with all Hilton's you can be assured that the rooms are clean and neat."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"Slightly below average due to lumpy mattresses and not enough room for breakfast. Popcorn in lobby was nice in the evening but the breakfast selection was barely adequate and severely short of seating. It was the first hotel in a series of five we stayed in during our recent 1100 mile roadtrip, very convienent to the highway. </DOC> Great hotel to stay at in a nice location. Pool could have been a bit warmer. The room had a fridge and a microwave which was an unexpected bonus considering the next 3 Fairfield Inns that we stayed at did not. </DOC> Stayed here for a stopover on a road trip. The staff were super friendly, room was clean and the hotel was quiet. Coffee was in the lobby and complimentary breakfast in the morning. We didn't have breakfast, nor use the pool. Parking was free. The best part about this hotel was the staff. Everyone from the manager, to the receptionist, to the cleaning people were friendly and continued to thank us for staying. For $125 a night 5 out of 5. If you found this helpful, please click the helpful button, thanks for reading! </DOC> My wife and I stayed at this Fairfield for three nights while touring the area. It's centrally located to downtown Albany and historic sites south off route #80 including Kinderhook, Hudson, and Olana. The staff is engaging and hospitable, our room was clean, and the free\xe2\x80\xa6 </DOC> the hotel staff especially Chris P was extremely friendly and helpful.This is an older facility but it is very clean and located right off the highway.The breakfast is comparable to other hotels at this price point.I would definitely stay here again. </DOC> I gave this hotel an extra star because of the kindness of the gentleman at the front desk. He went out of his way to correct the issues. As soon as we walked into the room I found a used tissue next to the nightstand. Then the toilet wouldn't stop running. We had to take the lid off the tank every time we flushed so it would fill. Breakfast was plain but the serving staff was extremely nice. Probably won't stay again. </DOC> No surprises. Comfortable bed, refrig, flat screen tv, strong wifi signal (free as marriott member). Breakfast was good, eggs, meat, cereal, waffle maker. Convenient to highway. Reception was pleasent and efficient. Seemed to have a significant amount of business people. </DOC> We stayed here for just 1 night. It is a typical Fairfield Inn. Clean room and very friendly employees. Well located next to the highway and next door to a Denny's and Cracker Barrel."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"Stayed three nights this time around. Hotel was what we expected of a HIE. Clean, spacious, well appointed rooms. Comfy bed. Good work station, adequate charging ports. Giant TV but missing a few of my go-to channels. Saturday morning I ran out of hot water mid-shower, but the hotel was full and this was probably prime shower time. A little disappointed with housekeeping staff - beds sloppily made, tissues not replaced two days on a row. Some noise from the highway so be prepared for that. Breakfast was fine - typical HIE spread, and I'm happy that they are now using paper plates and bowls instead of the usual styrofoam. </DOC> Stayed here for a recent family wedding. On the positive side, the staff was nice, but at times they seemed really overwhelmed. The beds were very comfortable and the gathering room off the lobby was comfortable to visit with family and friends. On the negative side, the shower was terrible, our room was in a nosier location where we could hear the highway, and our refrigerator made a constant noise as well, the work out room was out of 1990 and it was too hot to work out, despite the fan. We needed extra towels and they were not available so we had to use workout towels to shower one day. Also, the elevator was the slowest elevator I've ever seen so sometimes we walked the 4 flights. There were signs everywhere asking if the stay was excellent, but I'm not sure that was realy their goal. </DOC> Spent one night here for business and the hotel is located near the LIE so it is easy to access. Hauppauge is in the middle of Long Island so it is far from the traffice of NYC. Clean rooms, friendly service and a cold HVAC, which was very nice. The breakfast room is big and is very comfortable with lots of space. I would certainly recommend this hotel. </DOC> We stayed here for a wedding and the place was so nice and clean. Yes they had construction going on while we were there but we never heard anything from them and everything was perfect. Breakfast was great and they had a decent selection. </DOC> I came to check in to find out that somehow my reservation was for Wednesday and Thursday when it should have been for Thursday and Friday. The desk staff helped us get this resolved without any penalty. They also made sue to accommodate us although they were basically full. </DOC> The hotel is located off the frontage road off the LIE (I-495). Access on/off the interstate is pretty easy. When I stayed there the hotel was clean and well-kept. Complimentary breakfast was nice, too. Would stay there again. </DOC> While this property has seen better days, the stay was comfortable and no fuss. And while located next to Interstate 495, I was not bothered by the low hum of the traffic. Free breakfast and internet are a plus and the freshly baked cookies in the evening are a welcome treat and better than a nightcap. They have a pool and fitness center, but neither is outstanding. </DOC> The staff here is clearing overwhelmed. I asked for a shuttle to the hotel from the airport and had to call back three times because they forgot, didn't have a driver and kept me on hold for six minutes and never did pick up the phone. But the rooms were clean, breakfast was adequate and the environment is safe."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'I can\'t imagine picking this as a place to stay unless you are stranded and there is no other choice. Once in, stay in. The area does not seem safe. The restaurant food was really bad. Overall the place looks and feels run down...a way station for travelers coming out of NYC for early morning flights. Next time I will take my chances and travel from the city to the airport or look harder for another brand that does it right and is newer. Felt like a "training" property for young staff. Charging $1.50 for a bottle of water in the room was really tacky too. I agree with other reviews. I picked this for "Marriott" standard and it is not even close. </DOC> I think this is a better choice than Best Western, Holiday Inn, Days Inn, and Comfort nearby with shuttle service because they have a restaurant/ bar on site. The others have food delivery option or taxi to restaurant. Well worn, no frills, but clean and comfy. Staff is great. Breakfast available, slightly limited, as early as 4am if you have an early flight. </DOC> I often need to stay for one night between flights at JFK and this hotel is perfect for me as the beds are good. Shuttle good and I get a good nights sleep. I have stayed here many times and never had a problem with the room or the staff in any way. I recommend this hotel to the business traveler like me </DOC> Stayed here two nights on business, found the staff friendly and helpful. I had a corner room on the second floor and it was clean and very quite. Breakfast is adequate and normal for this class of hotel. I like the fact that they have a small dinner service and bar at the hotel as there is not much else close by for eating unless you have a car. The wait staff in the restaurant in the evenings are very good, much better then most other hotel restaurants I have experienced. (Highly recommend the Pork Chop Dinner.) The shuttle to the airport for your departure is dependable and drops you right at your airline terminal unlike some other area hotel shuttles that take you back to Federal Circle where you then have to take the AirTrain to your terminal, this saves a good 15 minutes or more. (Pickup when you arrive is at the Federal Circle Station.) </DOC> I stayed here for 3 nights over 2 stays. The free airport shuttle makes it easy to get to and from the hotel. The drivers are always prompt. The shuttle also makes it easy to catch the Metro into NYC. The rooms are very clean, as is the rest of the hotel. The staff are great, always willing to answer my questions and give advice. There is a good breakfast every morning, with longer hours than I have seen anywhere else. I ate dinner at the restaurant and it was better than expected. The only negative thing about this hotel is that there is nothing within walking distance. Of course, there\'s nothing that can be done about this, and the staff does everything within their power to make sure you haev a pleasant stay. </DOC> Simple hotel with good breakfast, free (slowish) WIFI and the advantage of free shuttle to both JFK and Jamaica Long Island Rail and metro station. There is a restaurant and bar open in the evenings open until 22.30 which is essential since the area has few, if any, options. Physical location is perfect for the airport and railway but the actual location is not particularly nice - not one to wander around in. FYI - take the hotel shuttle to Jamaica station, hop on the LIRR and for $3.50 (weekends) you can be in central Manhattan in 20-mins max! Bargain. On return you\'ll have to get a cab ($15.00) but use the \'safe-ride\' service immediately outside the station. </DOC> I stayed here on an extended layover at JFK. Getting to the hotel required taking the AirTrain but that\'s the fault of JFK. Shuttle back was quick and efficient. The rooms were small. The walls were paper thin. Rooms weren\'t cheap. Staff was efficient. Like I said, a typical New York airport hotel. </DOC> I had a first floor room which meant it was actually below street level. It smelled musty. The hotel is old and needs renovation. The room was clean though. The included breakfast is a dream for anyone that likes to prepare and eat microwaved food. It is close to Kennedy though, and my flight arrived 2.5 hours late, so I\'m glad I had only a short ride to the hotel. They have a shuttle, but I didn\'t take it. I took a taxi because of how late I arrived, and was amazed that I had to tell the cab driver where the hotel was!'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'After my last stay - the Crowne Plaza (my infamous 1 star review that got me 25.000 IHG points) I was skeptical of any JFK hotel. This place was great. Clean, good room and precisely what I was hoping for. Breakfast is a good lerk here too. Shuttle was prompt and the driver was courteous and helpful. Will stay here again. IHG gets it right with this property. </DOC> Check-in was quick and professional. King room...of course small...but clean and equipped. Shuttle leaves every hour on the hour, however he was 10min. late at 5am the morning we needed to get to the airport. We are "pre-checked" for security so we didn\'t have to get in the huge line and made it to our gate in plenty of time. </DOC> Shuttle service was excellent. Holiday Inn very poor. Was very noisy, was on 1st floor next to staircase and this was banging all night. Rooms are decent enough and clean. Close enough to the airport. Airport Shuttles leave at scheduled times, so plan ahead </DOC> We had a long, overnight layover between domestic and international flights and wanted an inexpensive and safe place to stay that was close to JFK airport. This hotel was perfect for a basic, one-night stay. Check-in was easy. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful when we asked to order take-out. Our room was clean and comfortable and offered basic amenities. There was also a complimentary airport shuttle, wifi, and express breakfast. We\xe2\x80\x99d stay here again if necessary. </DOC> We always get the day flight back to the UK, and always stay here. 5th time now in 5 years. OK, not a lot to do around here at night, but 50% of the city hotel prices, and we get into the city by train from Jamaica station. Staff are first class, rooms recently upgraded. Very clean, great value and a winner. </DOC> This HIE is in area that has no walking access to restaurants other than a Burger King a block away the other side of the freeway. You have to run cross under the freeway because the cars will not yield to you. They gave me a room in the basement level. The only view is the wheels of the car in the parking lot. But the room is clean even it is aging. The shuttle only operates hourly and the shuttle is dirty and not in good condition. I think the shuttle is shared with the Days Inn behind the HIE. The 9 AM driver did not help me with my bags. Therefore, no tips for him. . If you have an early morning flight, you will not have the breakfast that you paid for. For $20 dollar more, I could have stayed at the Marriott Court Yard. </DOC> Echoing previous reviews, this place does the job if you\'re looking for a night at JFK before or after a flight. It\'s in a pretty poor area but it doesn\'t really matter because you\'re only there to sleep. Shuttle worked efficiently both out and back and there was the usual breakfast buffet. Would stay again for a layover. </DOC> Nice clean well kept property. No frills. Shuttle to airport. The staff went out of their way to accomodate me while staying there. Helped with Fed-Ex shipping supplies. Picked me up from the sister hotel. Efficient service to the train stop at the airport. If you have to stay in this area, this is an okay place to stay. No dining places in walking distance, though.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"We had a great experience at this Holiday Inn. We had a suite for a girls' weekend. The room was spacious and the living area was as well. Towels were okay - could have been better. Amenities were nice and the bathroom was HUGE. Loved that there were pool towels left for us. It's in a great location - you can walk into the village of Lake George. The resort had really fun things to do - Shuffleboard, a putting green, huge outdoor and indoor pool, firepit, etc. The only downfall for us is that we wish we went in the summer so that we could enjoy all that it had to offer. Front desk staff and housekeeping were very helpful. Would definitely recommend this hotel. </DOC> Very efficient and friendly welcome. The hotel looks like it has recently been renovated.. the room was large, clean and well appointed, though I found the pillowtop bed to be too mushy for my taste. Did not eat in the hotel. Great water pressure and plenty of hot water. Free parking </DOC> Reasonable hotel with a long distance view of the lake. OK room but overall a little shabby and in need of decoration \xe2\x80\x93 apparently they\xe2\x80\x99ve had building work \xe2\x80\x93 so parts of the hotel are definitely in need of attention. Surprised to find that this was the most expensive hotel on our stay \xe2\x80\x93 the others were a higher standard \xe2\x80\x93 this is more of a motel. Outdoor pool clean but quite cold (20C/68F) but facilities OK. Indoor pool too busy to use. Clearly a family resort with lots of excited kids but the walls are sufficiently insulated so that you do get a good night\xe2\x80\x99s sleep. </DOC> We were there in July and it was awesome. There is two pools one inside and another one outside. We only used the outside one it was fun. If there is a lot of people in the hotel the pool can get crowdy. There are free drinks for kids and adults. The room was quiet and clean. I would definitely recommend that hotel if you are at lake george with your family. </DOC> Stayed here on the way to Mont Tremblant from NY on 12/23/04. Staff was freindly and got an excellent rate of $69 with the Entertainment discount. Room was clean and stocked with free bottled water. Indoor pool was great for the kids and they even had an outdoor hot tub which was relaxing. Restaurant in hotel offered free kids meals (food was average). All in all a very good hotel for a winter stop. From what I could tell the outdoor amenities for Summer looked to be in good shape. </DOC> Returned again with my family, children and grandchildren. Hotel still maintains it's excellent quality and service. The hotel is a vacation with in a vacation. The staff that handles the arts and crafts was outstanding. Place is well maintain, beautiful location surrounded by trees, staff cannot do enough for you, plenty of activities. Great view of the lake. Manager's reception three times a week for the guests. </DOC> The Holiday Inn at Lake George is a very good hotel with a view of the lake and surrounding hills. The room was good, clean and well appointed. Breakfast was not included in our bill so we ate in the adjoining restaurant, which was fine. Overall, a good place to say there. </DOC> The hotel is very clean and comfortable. Very courteous front desk personnel and speedy checkin. The rooms are large and the beds are comfortable. We ate at the restaurant and it was very good. The pool area has putting, shuffle board, chessboard, kids area, bunghole game and lots of chairs. It is not right in town but very close."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'This was the finest Best Western we have ever stayed in. The facility is beautiful as is the setting. The room was large, well equipped and clean. We slept very well an d the breakfast included was very good. Other than check in and checkout we had no involvement with the front desk but those activities were quick and courteous. The rate was high for a Best Western but reflected the location and the quality of the lodging. </DOC> This hotel was just average. I don\'t know what all the reviews are about with this place being amazing. Maybe in the summer it\'s a little bit better because you can go outside on their balcony. The area where you eat and get drinks is decent. The rooms were okay but still had old stuff in them. Not very many places to stay around the area so if I came back I guess I would choose to stay here again. Not a hundred percent thrilled about it though. </DOC> Recently we visited the Hyde Park area and decided to stay at the Best Western Plus, The Inn and Suites at the Falls. Best Western hotels have varied so much in the past that I have tried to avoid them, but decided to take a chance on this one. The hotel rooms are updated, clean and comfortable. The hotel offers a basic breakfast that meets my needs-fresh fruit, cereal, milk , juice and coffee. What more can you ask for really? But, what was a surprise is that the hotel grounds are lovely;there is a deck attached to the breakfast area,so you can eat your breakfast outside or have your morning coffee on deck. Very peaceful and relaxing. </DOC> We were pleasantly surprised by this hotel. The rooms we nice size and quiet. We had 2 luggage racks which was nice. Microwave and refrigerator in tr room is always useful. The 2 free drinks at happy hour were a bonus. The lounge area overlooks the creek which is pretty. Overall this was an excellent experience. It\'s about 4 miles back to route 9 but it\'s a short distance to good restaurants. </DOC> Very pleasant stay at this hotel. They offered happy hours in the afternoon with free alcohols and snacks. Peace location and clean room, my only complaint would be the bed and pillows were too soft until I got neck pain in the morning. Free hot breakfast in the morning as well. I\xe2\x80\x99ll recommend this hotel! </DOC> The BW Inn & Suites is clean, very nicely decorated, and a very friendly place. The rooms are large and the beds and pillows very comfortable. We had a darling view of a brook or stream below. I would not expect actual "water falls,\' but the view is lovely. Everyone at breakfast can have a view of the stream/little river regardless of their room location. Close to everything. Extremely accommodating hotel staff. Great place! </DOC> Great stay for the price. Wonderfully attractive exterior. The staff was outstanding. Breakfast was nicely presented. The breakfast staff was extraordinary in her attention to the freshness of the items and the cleanliness of the room. Booked through online service and the price was a great savings. </DOC> Pros: Very good budget hotel with an excellent French restaurant for dinner; good location near expressway and practical shopping. View from parking lot is fabulous. Cons: Might be hard to find as set above the main drag; location is 15 minutes from Stowe resort'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"This is apparently the only hotel in the area. The room was fine--nice, big, usual suburban corporate style nice, comfortable bed. The breakfast area (it's included with the room) was loud as a NYC subway. This was a Sunday morning, and I guess there were lots of different events there the night before. But if you want to hear your companion talk, get room service breakfast (if they have it--they may not, this is one of those breakfast buffet with omelette station kind of deals). </DOC> Enjoyed my stay here. Room was nice and clean. Some simple maintenance items have been neglected such as the vanity faucet loose and not attached to the countertop. The breakfast buffet was a highlight of my whole day. </DOC> This was $10 more than the days inn in the area, so I gave it a shot. If you don't mind the special events on the property (wedding, anniversary party, corporate party, etc) the rooms are lovely and spacious and the amenities are plush. Large sports center and pool are included. Wifi is $10 a day. No free breakfast. Several expensive restaurants on property. Would definitely stay again at the same rate. Dated decor, but beautiful property. Business center is great with free printing. </DOC> Good Confrence Destination, there are plenty of rooms and they are well laid out. It also has a very good layout for breaks, better than most. The food for a conference was better than average as well. If you are staying at the facility as well, the rooms are adequate. They are clean and a good size, however they are a bit tired and really in need of some renovation and upgrading. They need pluming updated, better lighting, and more power outlets. That said, the most difficult need to meet for a large conference are the conference rooms. In this area they are better than most. </DOC> This hotel is on the Doral golf course in Rye, not far from the Westchester County airport. The check-in was friendly and helpful. Bell captain service was very good. Rooms were a good value, although some signs of wear and tear (e.g., water damage in ceiling above shower) were apparent. The grounds were great and the layout for hosting business meetings was thoughtful and well executed. The breakfast buffet was substandard. We and others found ourselves begging for coffee. Fresh fruit was poor quality and selection. And there is a 20% gratuity automatically added with a note that None of this goes to the server. What an absolute insult and rip-off. </DOC> My wife and I just returned from an overnight stay at the Doral Arrowwood, The hotel is quite large, and the rooms are quite a distance from the lobby. The rooms are clean and spacious, but the real disapointment was the fact that when we went to take a shower in the morning, there was no hot water. We called the front desk and they stated they were aware of the problem and were looking in to it. I thought it was just an isolated incidance, but when we met the rest of our group that we were traveling with, they all stated the same problem. A hotel of this size and rating should have some sort of resource to deal with an issue such as this, To say the least I was disapointed with this hotel. </DOC> Here for two days for business. While the resort has a friendly vibe, physically it has seen better days. I\xe2\x80\x99d be surprised if it has been renovated since the 1980s. The rooms are like oversized motel 6 rooms with dingy carpet, stained sitting chairs, and low end furniture. The pool is spacious but weird, with ancient lounge chairs and bleach-stained towels; the lobby is strangely spartan, and the restaurants feel like they are stuck in the early 90s at best. I\xe2\x80\x99d give this place a \xe2\x80\x9cpoor\xe2\x80\x9d rating for even daring to call itself a luxury resort with luxury rooms (laughably untrue), but the spacious and pretty grounds have pushed me, somewhat uncomfortably, to call it average. </DOC> We were looking for a little romance and found a great gym, fabulous pool, excellent service, decent breakfast, occasional noise from local airport. Rooms could use a little updating and better lighting. The people who work here really make it."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'First off: don\'t get a room on the weekend facing the pool if you want quiet. They close the pool at 10, so it\'s not too big of a deal, I just noticed the noise when I first checked in. Rest if the week was very quiet. Walls are a little thin, but not the worst I have ever experienced. So why the excellent rating? Because the staff at this hotel are amazing!!! First of all Cynthia went above and beyond for me on two occasions, and even followed up with me to make sure I was satisfied. Every call I made to the front desk was answered promptly, dry cleaning brought back the same day, room service prompt and everyone just all around pleasant. You really believe they want to help you and provide the best possible customer service they can. I will stay here again. </DOC> Terrific rate through Priceline ($83 all in, on a Friday night). Easy, fast, early check-in around noon. Super friendly desk clerk. Large clean room with awesome Marriott pillows and duvets. Giant TV. Fridge. Nice balcony. Good towels and nice bathroom products. Gym was hard to find but worth the effort. All good. </DOC> Anyone who has stayed at a Marriott knows that the chances of getting a room with a comfortable bed and a "usable" pillow are slim to none. This Marriott is refreshingly different. Here the beds and pillows are great. You can actually get a good nights sleep here. Too bad more Marriotts cannot provide the same level of comfort. In addition, you can get a good dinner and at affordable price at the Cooper\'s Mill restaurant on site. Again, too bad more Marriotts don\'t have this restaurant, especially since Marriott owns the "brand". As any traveler will tell you, usually the food and drinks provided at Marriott restaurants and bars are horribly overpriced, and in some cases, rather ordinary. Did not try the gym or pool. Lots ok kids using the pool while we were there. Parking is free. </DOC> Not particularly close tot the HPN airport, it only took 15 minutes to get there with no traffic, closer to 30 with traffic. Comfortable and clean with a quality staff. Love that Marriott bed! I didn\'t have time to try the gym. </DOC> First time at this property and I will return. Greeters at the door was a nice welcome. Staff was very nice as well. Room was adequate but in need of some updating, such as outlets on the nightstands. All in all a really nice hotel and worth visiting. </DOC> Was here for a wedding. Rooms felt a little dated. My biggest complaint was that each time I went, no one was staffing the coffee bar in the lobby, front and center. I\'m not sure what the point of the prominently placed coffee bar is if no one is there! Otherwise, the staff was great, and I loved the newly redone hotel restaurant/bar. </DOC> We stayed at the hotel for a family gathering. The rooms were clean and well maintained. The pool had a dome over it so that it was bright and the kids had a ball using it. The staff including the restaurant service people was very friendly and helpful. Highly recommend. </DOC> We stayed here for the weekend while attending a baseball tournament. The property is clean and updated. The rooms were standard but very comfortable. What put the property over the top was the staff. They went out of their way any opportunity they had to take care of our large group. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a group stay and for those who have forgotten what great customer service is like. I haven\'t stayed in a hotel for some time where the staff seemed happy to be there.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"There is nothing wrong with this hotel outright, it is just an accumulation of lack of detail to small touches. On the plus side, the hotel is newer, clean and right off of I-81 at the Arsenal Street exit and close to shopping and restaurants. On the downside, the gym has no weights, the pool is tiny with no whirlpool, breakfast fare is limited and the room configuration is not ideal if you want to do business ... microwave shields TV from the desk and the chairs are not business adjustable type. </DOC> Hampton Inn Watertown is located just off of Interstate 81 and Route 3. Several other chain hotels border this property. Traffic noise on either side of the hotel is minimal. The property is located near several restaurants, supermarkets, retail stores, and fast-food establishments. Although a Denny's is within walking distance of the hotel, a vehicle may be needed to access all local amenities. Staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Guest rooms are clean and functional. Fitness center is a bit small but clean, and functional. Swimming pool is clean. Complimentary breakfast available with limited variety and selection. Please be advised, no restaurant on-site. Ample, free parking available. Overall, pleasant stay. I will return to this hotel when conducting business in the Watertown region in the future. </DOC> Check in was fast and easy. The front desk person was very friendly and courteous. Our room was clean and comfortable. We stayed for 3 nights visiting other towns in the area. Breakfast area was kept clean and well stocked each morning. All the employees we encountered were helpful and courteous. </DOC> This was a very nice Hampton that has been well cared-for. Breakfast was as expected and good. Our room on the top floor was very quiet. Watertown is an old historic area that we enjoyed exploring. Take the drive along Lake Ontario for nice views. </DOC> Travel all over the East, always know that Hampton will be clean & comfy. Bring my own toiletries so can't opine here. Front desk staff very friendly, helpful. For me, don't get surprises at Hampton; get what I expect --- Desk large, TV with good channel selection, spacious bath, clean & comfy bed. </DOC> Very typical Hampton. Clean, comfortable. They try to go above and beyond with snacks and drinks out for guests which is very nice. Would stay here again without hesitation. </DOC> i had made reservation directly with hotel about 3 weeks in advance...requested top floor and was told i would have room there. when i checked in the, very harried, desk clerk told me top floor was full and it was 1st come, 1st served. room was ok, clean, etc. breakfast area neat and plenty to eat. bathroom sink was obviously stopped up, any amount of water into sink kept rising and rising and drain was painfully slow. shower door was off the runners and would not close properly. hard to believe housekeeper could have overlooked. if i went back to Watertown i think i would check for another place. may be too picky, but for $168 a night the place sh/ be perfect. happy trails </DOC> After a long drive, it was great to see friendly faces. Jill and Paula were more than helpful. Jill assisted with finding various restaurants and directions, and was always courteous and efficient. The rooms are spotless, the linens are clean and fresh smelling, breakfast is terrific with an array of hot and cold items as well as oatmeal with fruit and nuts. Terrific location near the lovely towns of Sackets Harbor and downtown Watertown. Other personnel that were so helpful were Michael in fixing our television and Nancy, who made sure our room was the best it could be....."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'I am writing this review from the emerson spice . If you want to take the fill of real old stone town then this place for you . Old Arabic house restored & converted into classy hotel . Staff is really helpful , nice & big rooms , complete feel of early 19 th century . Breakfast on roof top was amazing experience . Only draw back of the hotel is quite interior & the small lanes are not made for vehicle you have to walk all the way with your luggage , not good ambience of that small lanes. But all together hotel is good but you do have many options in stone town like serena inn , dowh palace & many of them & that area is classy with real feel of old Arabic & Afro culture . I will not give 100% to this hotel coz there\'s many good options available in same price . </DOC> This being our first visit to Zanzibar and this being our first hotel there, we were immediately very impressed with the hotel and it\'s staff. All rooms are truly unique rooms, very spacious and beautifully decorated. Dinner and breakfast on the rooftop terrace of the hotel was great, with very good and fresh food, and a great view. Also the rooftop restaurant on the sister hotel is very recommendable with a more Arab atmosphere. The hotel is not easy to find, but hotel staff are always very helpful to guide. Also, Stonetown is not that large, so can never get lost that far. Our only small minus was the hardness of the bed, but that\'s a personal taste. We would definitely stay here again when visiting Stonetown next. </DOC> This hotel is absolutely fantastic...probably the most beautiful hotel I have ever stayed. There should be an extra star for places like this. If you\'re in Stone Town, it\'s completely worth the extra splurge, it will definitely be a memorable stay. What a beautiful place full of history, impeccably decorated, each room with special touches.... Particularly recommend Violetta room and especially the Kate room. Wonderful and hospitable owner and staff, and a fantastic rooftop with city view for breakfast or dinner to boot. Really a world class hotel, couldn\'t be more highly recommended! </DOC> This is a real gem. preserving original stone town architecture and providing great service and ambiance. Lose sense of time and enter the real exotic heart if stone town here. Highly recommended. Solo or romantic. Thanks Len, Russel and Katia for the experience and warm hospitality </DOC> Russell went out of his way to attend to the wifi, to the air conditioner which was leaking . the position of the hotel is remarkable ,as well as its style . the staff is tremendous . the terrace i have reviewed as part of the dinner but it is a treat also at breakfast </DOC> I think everyone should spend a few nights at a beach resort, and at least one in Stonetown. It would be a shame to miss this unique city. We spent 1 night at Emerson spice. Two would have been better. Such a unique property! Rooms were the biggest I have ever seen. Very "open" hotel and you feel like you are living and breathing Stonetown, if only for a moment. Don\'t miss sunset cocktails and the tasting menu on the rooftop. </DOC> Cute little boutique hotel in the old town of Zanzibar. We occupied four out of the 11 rooms and each was unique and very lovely. Indoor and outdoor shower, nice and comfortable beds and a cool location everything fitted perfectly. We had dinner on the rooftop where the view is great and the food matched perfectly (prices rather high). On our last breakfast (also on the rooftop) the attentive and friendly crew even danced with us. :-) </DOC> Stone town is like stepping back in time into some exotic adventure story. Emerson Spice sets the stage for that impression perfectly. Spacious and beautifully decorated rooms, fantastic balconies, a wonderful roof garden and comfort all over. Great breakfasts (I didn\'t try other meals) and the service was very good. The location in the centre of Stone Town is also good. Next time I will be in Zanzibar I will definitely stay here again!'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'Looking at the Radisson standards world wide this property need to pull up a lot. It is an average 3 star property with basic features. Ideally very good for business travelers. Rooms are nice in size bathrooms are horrible the water comes out from the bathing area and spreads in the entire floor. Service didn\'t tried much but found it ok. Wi-Fi was free but didn\'t work either when I asked for technical help there was no support. We stayed for a night and moved on, breakfast was good, they should enhance by giving some healthier options. </DOC> This is possibly the best hotel in Jalandhar. We checked in around 9.30 pm in the night and was very happy to be upgraded to the Executive Suite - which was really spacious and luxurious. Service was very prompt and was greatly appreciated - although the quality of food could surely be improved, both for in room service as well as breakfast. </DOC> Boasting an ideal location in the heart of Jalandhar this property offers good value. Certainly not upto Radisson standards due to small size and lack of hospitality. The hotel offers nice dining options with Kabab Factory & Noble House along with the JD Bar. </DOC> The hotel is conveniently located , has good breakfast , nice food - though a bit oily and good clean room . The staff is helpful and courteous . The air conditioning of the hotel is a bit noisy but it depends on the room location . Otherwise had a comfortable stay and will recommend the hotel . </DOC> Stayed in July last week and the services were quite good. Rooms were spacious and good food. Breakfast menu can be better, gym was excellent as well as the trainer. Fitness equipments are good as well as the trainer. This is located at centre of town </DOC> When I come to Punjab I always stay here ... the building is clean and well maintained and the rooms are great. On this stay I was given a huge room overlooking the main road and it was very comfortable and quite. Good choice of food in restaurants and the room service is good without the added charges that many hotels add on. Staff are polite and helpful and try and accomodate your requests. The small gym and spa is too small for my liking and the pub JD\'s a like a fridge otherwise its a good place to stay. For me if you are staying somewhere which is plus 40C you need a hotel that is cool and clean, but warm and friendly and guys - this is it. </DOC> This is a good hotel in Jalandhar - if slightly "olde worlde" for my own personal liking - though I\'m sure for others this is what will add to the charm of the place. Based on a one night stay I can say it was comfortable and nothing really to complain about. The staff were friendly and welcoming and there was a good breakfast buffet. There\'s a good shopping centre right next door - and not too far away from other shops etc. Didn\'t really use any other facilities. Overall a reasonable hotel. </DOC> A very well kept property complemented by its courteous and polite staff. Right from the complimentary pick up, the seamless checkin in under a minute, the blazing wifi connection, to the sumptuous breakfast buffet, everything was in perfect order. The hotel far exceeded my modest expectations. Though I was here for only a night and that too on a business trip, if I ever do return to Jalandhar, I know where I shall be put up at. Keep up the excellent work people.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"Have stayed at this hotel a few times and the rooms are great. Definitely a great Couples getaway. Rooms are clean, quiet and have the amenities expected. It's nice to have the restaurant on site and enjoy the room/dinner package offered by the hotel. Our dinner experience was not 5 star this time around and hope that the service is not sliding. The usual top notch service was not present in the restaurant which was disappointing as we were celebrating our anniversary. Since we are repeat customers and have recommended this facility to numerous friends, I truly hope it was just an off night for the waiter and that he realizes all customers are as important as the next. The other restaurant staff (waiters assistants) were still on their toes and provided the service expected. The food was still fantastic and we hope to have a better experience next time. </DOC> Salvatore's stands out for romance, great food and amazing rooms. Suites with giant hot tub baths, fireplace, large TV plus so much more for that extra special night. To top off all of that there is Russell's Dining Restaurant. I swear that this is the classiest restaurant yet still great service and amazing food. Enjoy steaks, salmon, pork plus great sides. </DOC> Excellent stay and dinner. Had a problem with the room and bar and they were taken care of immediately! Dinner was superb. Best steak I ever had. Always a pleasure to stay and dine here. Rooms, spacious and clean. </DOC> My finance and I rented the Jacuzzi Package. The rooms have a King Bed which which is loaded with pillows and so comfy! The walk in shower has soap and shampoo dispensers. And the Jacuzzi is oh so wonderful. The package also includes a $90 dinner coupon. We have stayed here several times and always love the cleanliness and size of the room! The staff is always very professional and courteous! Mr. Russell Salvatore has a outstanding hotel and is a leader in giving back to the community! </DOC> This place was recommended by the company I was visiting in the area. Nice spacious room with nice furnishings. They have a small, but nice workout room. Breakfast buffet was included- good food! They also have an excellent steakhouse on-site! Excellent place to stay! </DOC> Stayed several times and we are never disappointed. Rooms spotlessly clean and beds really comfortable. Convenient location for shopping and airport. Staff very friendly and courteous. Keep up the great work! </DOC> I LOVED this hotel in all respects except one. The decor is really different and wonderful, the rooms spacious and clean, the access to the highway and easy parking is perfect, the WiFi works well, etc. My problem with the hotel is that there is an awful scent just about everywhere. Perhaps they think that they must provide this because they think guests like it? I did not sleep well because I could not get rid of it. There may be a room deodorizer somewhere or maybe it's the cleaning products. But, I noticed this scent in the public hallways too. I find it just awful and I know it's not healthy to use those things. PLEASE MANAGEMENT, IF YOU ARE READING THIS, IT WOULD KEEP ME AWAY NEXT TIME!! </DOC> Salvatore's Grand Hotel is the most amazing hotel that we have stayed at. Classy in every way with great service throughout the hotel. Always greeted well at the front desk and great staff everywhere. Rooms are awesome especially the jacuzzi suites. Rooms are spotless and romantic. Great place to celebrate with your special someone. Wonderful package deals to include dinner at Russell's Steakhouse. Best steak that I have had anywhere plus so many other great dishes. Again service is amazing. In writing this You might think that I am exaggerating but no everything is true. The lounge is a cozy place with giant screens showing recent concerts."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"Once again this Wingate chain hotel lived up to my expectations and my stay was wonderful! The front desk staff was fast, friendly, and professional. The room was spotless clean and well appointed. </DOC> Charlotte spreads out so widely that unless you're staying downtown you need to have a hotel that connects to the many important avenues and even highways that crisscross the town. We stayed at the Wingate and had business all over the city and found the hotel made raveling easy no mater where we were going. It's handy to most of the4 city's arteries passing through the really nice neighborhoods in this really nice town. But that's just geography. The hotel was clean, professionally run and maintained with a helpful staff and reasonable rates. We didn't use the pool or the exercise facilities but they were there had we wanted to,. Breakfast is abundant with the usual variety of eggs, pastries, cereals and local specialties. This hotel worked very well for us and we'd happily stay there again sometime. </DOC> This hotel has a shuttle to and from the airport, free continental breakfast, rooms are large, business center and a pool. Those are the advantages of the hotel. But isolated from places to eat. Even though my make friends adventured to go to the gas station and got some fast food and cheap beer. The rooms are very comfortable with a fridge and micro. I would have not go out but there is no restaurant onsite, so you have to get out somehow somewhere. </DOC> Have stayed twice recently, and the rooms are very clean and larger than a standard hotel room so you do not feel claustrophobic. The breakfast exceeds expectations for a hotel in this price range. This is a great place for a business traveler on a budget. </DOC> Stayed here on business / pleasure trip for one night. The place is clean and has decent parking, well-lighted. Room was spacious and appears that it was recently freshened up. Their shuttle runs to the Lynx (Light Rail) station at Tyvola and Old Pineville Rd. That's the way to get to the city centre, convention centre or the stadium. 8 bucks, for the return ticket. WiFi was just OK, with lots of buffering on NetFlix. That's my criterion for returning to a hotel. This hotel has a pretty nice complimentary breakfast spread. Better than most, and well-tended by the staff. Worth a tenner at least, right? Would recommend this place at Priceline rates, not rack rates. </DOC> Had to stay here because we missed our connection at the Charlotte Airport. Made a reservation through Trip Advisor for $111. Got to hotel via hotel shuttle near 1 AM. They gave me the bill to sign and it was $155! Showed them the reservation on my phone and they ended up giving the room for $99 which was really nice. We got a suite and it was very nice, but we had to get up at 5 to catch a 5:30 shuttle. The front desk person again very nice asked how was our room and allowed us to catch some breakfast BEFORE the breakfast was open. Shuttle driver was nice also. So want to praise the night desk clerk for his hospitality and the hotel was very clean and very well run. </DOC> We have stayed at this hotel several times. Clean, comfortable, quiet, good amenities. Polite, professional staff. Good breakfast selection. Will stay again if in area. </DOC> This hotel was about what I expected. It was located close to the airport, my software training, and plenty of restaurants within five miles or so. The room was fairly large with a decent couch to sit at. It had a refrigerator and microwave. The bed was comfortable and the room was plenty dark at night. The room appeared clean but didn't quite feel it - probably because it was a little dated. A fairly standard continental breakfast. The cups for coffee were quite small though, which was kind of irritating because I wanted to take one to my room while I did some reading. Service was below average. It was merely functional."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'We had an average stay experience at this hotel. The noise level was a little above average. The room needed a better cleaning because ledges/edges of all of the furniture was very dusty/dirty. It was supposed to be a smoke-free hotel but we had someone close to our room smoking and it permeated into our room. We called the front desk twice to complain; the second time someone and confirmed our complaint, but informed us they cannot determine the origin of the smoke. </DOC> First, I don\'t think I would stay here again. The first room we were assigned smelled like some petroleum product. We were moved, but the rooms are small and arranged strangely. The parking in the hotel is paid on your bill and at a $12 charge per night. The parking is right next door, but when you come out of the garage, you enter a one way street. It can be difficult to get back to the hotel entrance. The property is near a lot of downtown restaurants, the epicenter, and stadiums. There are a lot of other hotels that appear to be nicer close by, so I believe we will stay elsewhere next time. The finishes in the hotel are getting worn and outdated. There is no complimentary breakfast, but there is a Starbucks bar with some limited food choices for purchase. </DOC> We stayed on a weekend so got a good price. The hotel address is Tryon st but you actually have to turn onto 3rd to get to entrance. Selp part adjacent to hotel is $ 10 per day. Rooms look new or recently refurbished. Nice flat screen tv and room size was not big but adequate and very clean. Room had wall thermostat but had individual unit on near window which ran all the time regardless of temperature so finally just turned it off. Hotel had buffet breakfast but we did not try. Overall good place in good location at good price! </DOC> Let me start with the positives - the staff and the location. You are close to everything and can walk a few blocks to get to resturants, the game, entertainment, etc. The Staff is wonderful - helpful, smiling, happy. The problems I have are 1) parking - conveniently located in the lot attached to the hotel yet no speficied hotel parking so you can spend 20 mins looking for a spot. 2) the room - was old, dated and needed an face-lift. Stains on the carpet, shower curtain that didn\'t fit and, worst of all, a bed that felt like 10,000 people had slept on it. Also, no cell coverage in the room - at all. This hotel might work for some, but I\'m going to look for an alternative next time I\'m in CLT. </DOC> Stayed here while working in the are and found this Courtyard to be very modern and beautiful rooms with a sliding glass door leading into the courtyard....(we had a room on the first floor obviously). The bedding was so comfortable and the rooms did not have the normal "hotel" noise. We were assigned an exterior room at first and asked for an interior one with a sliding glass door leading outside and was given one without thought. For the upper floors they have balconies. House keeping and the front desk staff were super </DOC> This hotel... not sure what\'s happening. I\'m a rewards member. And was not treated to the thank you for being a member. The room given was dirty with trash in the room. Asked for new room and lovely Christopher was happy to assist, the room was clean. It faces the street and is SUPER noisy from street noise. Cell coverage STINKS. Wifi was slow. Disappointing as a rewards member. </DOC> Stayed here for 5 nights, very friendly and helpful staff. Rooms are nice and bed comfortable. Great breakfast although wish they wouldn\'t play loud rock music at 6:30am. Has a gym which probably has too much equipment in it for the size of room so feels a bit claustrophobic when busy. Also has a pool. </DOC> Great location, easy enter/exit and parking at a reasonable price in a garage on site; great start! This Courtyard has been renovated and is easy on the eyes from the time you enter, while you sit in the lobby or in the hotel corridors. The rooms are very "up to date" with nice furniture, plenty of USBs all around the room for charging electronics and a nice flat panel TV. The service was outstanding and friendly. This is a nice hotel, in a great location at a reasonable price...especially reasonable on the weekends when thee are no events!'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'Not a bad location across from the train into Charlotte if you want to avoid parking in town. Hotel itself is a bit secluded behind a strip plaza out front on Woodlawn Road. Hotel itself is a bit dated but well maintained, at least the rooms I have been given. Stayed twice in August, first stay was good but room ac had a terrible noise that kept me up all night, no sleep. I told the new manager Billy and he solved the problem completely and my second stay was on him, great hospitality on his part regarding my problem with the previous room and my Platinum account. Thanks again and I will be sure to be back this year. </DOC> The hotel was fine, and the service was fantastic. The room was good and clean and comfortable. The location is somewhat lacking and not the most comfortable in the world. The neighborhood is probably considered up and coming... </DOC> I agree with other reviewers... the bed is comfy and the room is nice and clean. But there is something going on that makes me hesitate to come back. Maybe it is the location or the age of the property. It sure doesn\'t feel warm. I could deal with the location, which can be argued to be somewhat convenient to downtown, but there is something intangible about the place that pulls me up short. I stayed there only because all the Marriotts and Hiltons were booked. I don\'t think you\'d strike out going here... it\'s just not memorable. </DOC> Checkin fast but fellow at the reception not a man of many words! Room good Sheraton Standard! Free WiFi! Seating area nearby reception and breakfast room very nice! Business room not accessible and fitness room small but fit for purpose! Pool behind the carpark with the charm of the Everglades (a bit of a swamp/ s picture) Very good AAA rate and free parking! Plenty of fast food restaurant in the area! Good place </DOC> I did not spend much time in this hotel as it was just an overnight after a flight cancellation. The shuttle was quick and efficient. I was given a suite as a Starwood Platinum, although I literally just walked in the room and went to bed. Rooms were clean, quiet, and comfortable. Beds were comfortable. Bathrooms were clean and functional. I wouldn\'t hesitate staying here again. </DOC> Hotel is newer and fairly nice and clean. Service was subpar though. Placed me in a room across from grand ballroom and there was event going on. Very loud. Room service was supposed to come within 30 mins or free. After close to an hour I called and the gal that answered the phone said, "oh sorry we forgot." Free burger for me. Front desk was friendly but disengaged. They probably see a fair share of cranky us air customers but they didn\'t seem to care too much. </DOC> Stayed here due to cancelled flight at Charlotte airport. Big mistake !! The room and hallway smell mold. Half of hallway carpet was torn up. Things got far worse ....... Waked up 3 a.m. by some itching movements on my body. Turned on lights and several blood sucking bugs on bed !! These bugs are about 1/4 inch long, dark brown in center with red sides. I got about 6 bites on back waist line. Next day those bites swollen and became large red hard lumps. As big as golf ball size. Horrible !! Yes. I took a couple of bug pictures. I reported this problem to Four Points customer services but received only an automated email reply. Hope you read my review before deciding to stay in this hotel !! </DOC> The entire staff needs to learn Professionalism and Hospitality! The staff is quite unfriendly and unprofessional. Rooms are extremely outdated and unclean! The area surrounding the hotel is extremely unsafe! I have stayed at Motel 6 properties that were cleaner and friendlier than this hotel.'
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b'nestled in a quiet location and the hotel is well maintained and staff was friendly and room was large enough for a one bedroom unit ( only 2 ) room had a coffee maker which makes you feel like you are going to sleep in the morning .breakfast is limited but they serve a variety of hot and cold food items</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"We stayed here during the City BBQ Championship, which was conveniently held right outside the hotel. The hotel is gorgeous and the rooms were nice. It is in a great spot for downtown Charlotte activity. My only complaint would be thin walls. We had a louder than normal group of people across the hall and unfortunately heard them throughout the night. </DOC> I have to admit I did not spend a lot of time in my room due to my schedule, but I had a great time here. Centrally located you are close to a lot of attractions. I attended a concert at the Time Warner Cable Arena which is steps away. A great free breakfast. Clean nice rooms. </DOC> Everything about this hotel is wonderful! The staff are very helpful, knowledgeable and seem happy in their jobs. The rooms are clean, spacious and modern. The gym is so much better than a typical hotel gym--full of treadmills, bikes, ellipticals, weights etc--there was even a spin class I was able to take before work. The restaurant had wonderful food, the bartenders are fantastic. But the highlight of this hotel has to be concierge. It's large, clean, open 24/7, has a nice spread in the morning and evening, and lots of great snacks in between, plus comfy couches, which were very, very nice during our late work night. Staff in concierge was very nice and helpful. My coworkers and I spent a lot of time there. We travel for work every week and stay in many hotels. This one is our favorite. </DOC> This is a great Marriott in a great location. Rooms are clean and nice, what you would expect from a 4 star Marriott. Nice lobby and coffee shop. Time Warner arena is just a short walk and an even shorter walk to a nearby entertainment complex with a movie theater, shops, casual and upscale dining, bars and everything you need. Great service, the only thing that was not so good was the room service food. </DOC> Stayed one night here for our Anniversary..was very impressed with property, but more so with the excellent Staff,from Nick and Cassie in the absolute Best M lounge we have ever been in, to Samuel at the bar.Great job,Fin at the front desk,and a Special Thank You to the manager Chaz,who made our stay Great! Thanks to all of you ! You are truly what an Excellent Marriott stay is All about!!Hotel is centrally located right uptown near Everything,easy check in,thanks Brandon,great lounge,restaurant,bar.The rooms where spacious and nice, very comfortable beds.Fantastic state of the art gym!Everything you would expect from an upscale Marriott.Will definitely be back! </DOC> Spent 3 nights at this location for Conference. Staff was very friendly, and food was excellent. Meeting rooms and Hotel room were comfortable and bed was relaxing. Did not like Alexia set up and on inside the room, and would have liked to have been warned it was there. Hotel had $30 flat rate limo shuttle waiting to give me a ride to the Airport, which was nice. Did not eat at the Hotel restaurant, but plenty of restaurants nearby. </DOC> Stayed here for 2 nights in early June while on business. Room was a good size and bed and pillows were comfortable. Front desk staff were friendly and the location of hotel is great. This hotel has to be of the sweetest smelling hotels I ever stayed in. Not overpowering, just nice. I had a room on the 8th floor and the corridor leading to my room smelt wonderful. Would stay here again with no hesitation. </DOC> We stayed here for the weekend and it was amazing. The service, quality of food, and the rooms was outstanding as usual. This hotel is in a wonderful location, walking distance to everything. We are looking forward to staying here again on our next visit to Charlotte! A taxi to and from the airport is a flat $25 if you are not renting a car. Well worth it."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"I stayed here one night on business. The room was spacious, but do not get a first floor room. The smell of breakfast was overpowering in my room. The room was missing hand soap and there was no toilet paper on the roll, so it hadn't been fully serviced. There are no racks for hand or bath towels, which seemed especially odd for an extended stay hotel. My main complaint was the water pressure. The shower alternated from a trickle to regular water flow and between hot/cold. This is the second Hilton property I've stayed at in a month where the shower curtain smelled moldy. I would probably not stay here again. </DOC> This is a nice hotel. The staff is nice and the hotel is spotless. There is an outdoor pool and a indoor whirlpool and gym. They do provide a welcome home reception it is Mon-Thurs. We checked in on Thurs. and it consist of chicken nuggets ,fries, tossed salad, beer and wine, assortment of juices. Breakfast was sausage, eggs, oatmeal with toppings, biscuits, bagels, muffins ect. The rooms were nicely appointed, clean and neutragena products and the beds are Serta and they sleep wonderfully. This area is building up there wasn't many places to shop or eat on this road , but in the last two years it has. There's a new Walmart and Sam's club and a few fast food resturants about three miles up the road. </DOC> My wife and I were traveling with two small boys and this room was perfect for our needs. We had a suite with two bedrooms which worked out very well. Very clean and very functional!the rooms appear to be very quiet too. The kitchen served our needs well too. </DOC> Stay at this property for 4 nights. The check in and out is easy. The room is spacious enough and clean. Breakfast selection is good, evening special is plenty. The lady who prepare dinner is very friendly and nice. The area close to eatery and shops. I will be back. </DOC> I received a complimentary room upgrade to a suite with two bedrooms. Very huge suite. All the facilities were functional and clean. Free evening reception from Monday to Thursday was not bad. Breakfast was also good. The staff at the front desk working at late night was not friendly. Gym and pool was a little bit cramped. The carpet in the restaurant was not very clean. </DOC> Hard location to find with GPS. Now undergoing significant renovations. Key had to be reset daily to get into room. Breakfast on 3rd floor Hot food was cold and not tasty. No bowls or sugar/honey to go on cereal. There must be better hotel options in the area. </DOC> I was there for a week on 7th floor. The hotel was totally sold-out. Lots of young people, and probably everyone took a shower at the same time or the hot thank is not big enough..:-( The shower water at 7 am was always not hot enough.. I complained but they looked me like I was lying or something.. just did not take me seriously! I used to stay at this location few times and never had issues.. Next time I will stay at the Hilton Garden Inn near by. </DOC> Stayed here as near to office and a relatively good rate for the room but in all honesty would rather have paid a bit more ans stayed elsewhere as other than a comfy bed very little else positive to say. On arrival greeted by friendly reception staff but room was not very clean including finding sticky residue on two tables and a used toothbrush and toothpaste in the wardrobe (on the shelf) one door was missing from the wardrobe and on checking the glasses these were also not very clean. Food quality in restaurant was ok at breakfast but dinner was a different matter, tasteless and poorly presented and considering this was a $150 a night stay overall very poor value for money, whole hotel needs a lot of TLC and some serious updating for me to consider staying again."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"Nice hotel with a nice surrounding area. Walmart and several restaurants close by. I always stay here when in the Raleigh area as it is cheaper and simply better! Room was nice and clean, I would love to see the extra towels I request, but don't always get them. </DOC> This hotel was one of the best. I would like to thank the manager, assistance manager, 3rd shift front desk, 1st shift front desk and dinning room personnel. This is one of the best stays that I have had in a few days. The hotel was quiet and the great location to Walmart and other stores. This was a great stay and when I return to this area, this will be my hotel of first choice. First Class. </DOC> I love to stay here because I need a ice cold room ( 65 degrees) and their air conditioners really keep it where you set it! Friendly , clean, breakfast is fine , coffee is superb and hot . I like the oatmeal , nuts and fruit. </DOC> Overall , this is the absolute nicest Hampton Inn I've ever stayed in. Staff is extremely friendly and also helpful, especially about traveling in the area . Very clean. As a Hilton Diamond member I was upgraded to suite which was very spacious and nice. I typically stay at a hotel across from where I have to visit in Cary ; however, it is worth the travel to stay in Holly Springs , which I will again. </DOC> I continue to use this location for the second year in a row for my business groups and meetings. Best staff, rooms, and rates. I feel like a member of the team here. Everyone remembers me and truly values my business. Although it is a drive into Raleigh, you will not go wrong with driving the extra 10-15 miles. King suite is the size of many apartments, and worth it. </DOC> Too many people to name at this hotel that provides wonderful guest visit each and every visit to this hotel. The entire staff is wonderful and the hotel is quiet and secluded in an area that located to restaurants and shopping. Nice people at this hotel that go above and beyond the call of duty to make sure that guest are taken care of and provide a nice and pleasant stay. But the staff makes the difference from Scott the general manager, Shanta the front desk manager, Gwen the Assistant general manager, and the entire staff. Great stay every visit and convenient to the cities. </DOC> My wife and I stayed here two nights for a wedding in May 2012. We received a group rate as guests of the wedding. The quality of service a d cleanliness is what I have come to expect from Hampton Inn. I can't think of anything super amazing, or anything negative about our stay here, so I take that as a good thing. The setting seems a bit strange as it is a bit removed from a commercial strip with what appears to be a private residence or two in between, but it's not that far off the beaten path. I would stay here again if I were in the area. </DOC> Beautiful hotel, rooms are great.Staff very friendly. Would never expected this hotel in that location."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'Excellent hotel a bit hard to get to until you learn the "back way" in and out but worth the effort to find if going to an event at PNC. Hotel was very new; very clean; very well kept; had outstanding breakfast; modern setting inside; excellent pool with unusual nice things for young adults and children; very, very secure although location does not seem to need it; very friendly staff but there seemed to be too many supervisors and limited doors but enough doors to get things accomplished. </DOC> Room 604, top floor. A new property and if you like modern decor, you\'ll love this hotel. It\'s situated near an upscale mall, on a hill. Nice location. The disappointments were: (1) not pet friendly, (2) hard/flat pillow nuggets, (3) thin doors that were not soundproofed, (4) no in-room safes, fridges or microwaves, (5) shower, no tub. We liked the newness and the lobby where families could gather in comfortable groups to use the iMacs, watch the plasma big screen televisions, or hang out on the low slung couches. </DOC> This was a new and clean Hampton Inn, but it was loud. There was construction going on right next to it and the sound quality in the room was as good as other Hampton Inns. So, forget about sleeping in on a weekday. The location was right off the freeway and near the mall, but the access in and out and to the mall was confusing, so plan for that. The staff was friendly and efficient. There were several other hotels in the immediate area (Courtyard, HiltonGarden Inn, etc) that I might try next time instead. </DOC> I visit Raleigh often and this was the first time to stay at this particular hotel. This hotel feels like a much higher class hotel from the time you walk in, until the time that you leave. The Staff is very courteous and friendly. While it was a little tricky getting into the hotel from the Interstate, it is in a good location of town with plenty of things to do nearby. While they don\'t have a bar in the hotel, they do offer a shuttle bus to anywhere within three miles. </DOC> Great location. Very clean, updated, modern. Not the "typical" Hampton Inn. Plenty of restaurants and shopping near by. A tad on the noisy side, but to be expected since located near a highway. Easy to find. </DOC> Stayed here for one evening recently to attend a concert at PNC Arena...hotel was bright/new and welcoming. Staff was friendly from check in to check out. Everything was clean and nice. Hotel was quick access to major highways in Raleigh. I know this is a new hotel, but this location is great and the staff is superb...so I think once the newness wears off a little, the hotel will still be grand because of the staff and the location. </DOC> Stayed here for a quick trip to Raleigh and this Hampton Inn did not disappoint. Very modern, can tell it was new. Rooms were very clean and the bed was great. Quiet rooms too, not always a given at Hampton Inns. The check-in was a breeze even without reservations. Love the lobby area. Very welcome and inviting. Will be staying here again when in town. </DOC> I stayed one night in a King room at this new Hampton Inn in Raleigh. When I made my reservation, I asked for a room that faced the parking lot to avoid traffic noise from I-440. The room was quiet and there was very little noise from traffic. Being new, the hotel is in great shape. The King room was very nice and the bed was comfortable. The Internet worked well in the room. Breakfast was good, standard Hampton Inn fare and the breakfast area is large enough to accomodate many people. With this hotel being newar Crabtree Valley Mall, there are many dining and shopping options close by. The staff was friendly and I had no issues. I would recommend this Hampton Inn.'

SUMMARY:  b'great location for a business conference and this hotel was close to the highway which was just a few minutes walk away and the front desk staff are friendly and helpful and they are a bit of a mess .room clean , beds are comfy but food was not very good value for money for a holiday inn standard</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"Number 1 in Robe on Tripadvisore already and for a good reason. Off the main street in a nice location overlooking the town and the lake. And still just a very short walk to shops, cafes and restaurants.Our room was huge with a king size bed, kitchenette and more space than you could use. Great service and the very nice hosts made our stay even better. </DOC> Friendly welcome, big room, wifi free, kitchen well equipped (even got given a milk carton at checking for our tea) and good location by the lake. Only drawback was hot water was a bit unreliable in the morning, but the rest of the place is nice enough to compensate! </DOC> Stayed one night at the Lakeview motel with family of 5 in their family room consisting of 2 queen and one foldout double sofa bed. Clean with crisp sheets and a lovely view over the lake. Outdoor seating as well. Very helpful owners who gave good information on eating out and best driving routes. Excellent value for money. A great stop over on route to either Adelaide or Melbourne . </DOC> Check in was a pleasant experience and the room was very clean and tidy with enough utilities. WiFi was good and the bed was very comfortable so had a great nights sleep. The property was about a 3 minute drive to the shops and restaurants of Robe. </DOC> We only sopped here overnight. We found the service great, the room comfortable and being able to park at the door a bonus. There is a lovely lake view from the room and it is very quiet. Its not far to drive into town to pick up dinner. </DOC> Our room was spacious, had a full kitchen, dresser, wardrobe, sofa, a great view of the nearby lake, and an outside table and chairs. Dougal the owner was very welcoming and suggested a great restaurant in town, The Caledonian. We'd definitey stay here again. </DOC> I stayed here for 1 night. This is a nice motel about 1km from central Robe with a view over a lake but not waterfront. Very friendly staff. The room was 1970's style quite spacious with a basic bathroom. It was designed for the pre-internet era and only 1 power point that I could find which involved disconnecting the TV, using my piggy back plug and moving a table for my laptop next to the fridge. The wifi didn't work and there was no way of reporting this as reception was closed and the Nomad Net website didn't work either. So for business visits this motel should be excluded. I asked for a late checkout and was kindly offered a 30 minute extension after some consideration by the friendly manager. </DOC> This motel is in a beautiful location overlooking Lake Fellmongery. The room we had was recently refurbished in a very attractive style and had a balcony with lake view. It has all kitchenette facilities and there is a BBQ area if you wish. The proprietor is very friendly and helpful with good information. We went to the end of the Robe Peninsular and did some walking \xe2\x80\x93 very spectacular views. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t really fault it, we were very comfortable though it\xe2\x80\x99s at the more expensive end of motel pricing. Good wifi."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"Friendly front desk. Clean and comfy rooms with some special decorative touches and splashes of color ! Excellent and most convenient stay. Within walking distance to restaurants and shops is an added convenience. </DOC> Nice and friendly staff, good choices on breakfast. A higher price for a weekend night was more than I expected. Flat screen TV was nice, remote works well and internet a bit sporatic. Only problem in this hotel is the A/C/heat unit blew on my neck when I used my computer at the desk; I got chilled but so far, not sick. </DOC> This hotel is a must stay at on our trips south. Clean, comfy and welcoming. The rooms are a nice size, have great TV choices and a strong WiFi. The rooms have a fridge and microwave. There is a laundry room on the second floor. Coffee and hot breakfast were tasty and hit the spot. Always a warm greeting from Mary and Nicky and always look forward to staying at the Sleep Inn in Smithfield. Also, plenty of dining options within walking distance. </DOC> There is a list of TV networks and on which channels but no TV Scroll on the TV to see whats on for the next hour or so for each channel. Heard 5 trains but not loud enough to awake you. Cant hear them if the TV is on. 4 soft bath towels. The mexican diner across the road has really good food at $. Friendly staff here and good coffee. It rates a 5 here for a good sleep but the lack of the amenityTV scroll means you flip thru all the channels, takes 15 min with all the commercials, each half hour, to see whats on. What a drag. </DOC> Three story hotel with finess center and lovely outdoor pool area. We requested and got a first floor room in rear. Good senior rate of $78 for king room with free wifi, fridge, microwave, and large flat TV. Large breakfast room serving eggs, sausage, waffles, bagels, cereal, etc. This excellent place also serves cookies in the evening. Excellent place to stay in Smithfield. </DOC> From the warm welcome to pleasant checkout after a hot and tasty breakfast, this visit was flawless. We have used this hotel many times, and we continue to be amazed how updated, clean, modern, and new this hotel looks. On checkout we were discussing how this hotel would rank in all the choice hotels in which we have stayed. We cannot recall another hotel that is equally appointed. Our room was immaculate: Clean, spotless, and neat. The carpet and decor appeared new. The common areas were spotless as well. Breakfast was hot, tasty, and well attended. When we travel, we plan our trip using this hotel as our overnight. </DOC> We normally stay at this location at least twice a year. It continues to offer fantastic rooms at great prices. Front Desk Staff is always welcoming and pleasant and the rooms are clean and well maintained. The hotel is near an outlet shopping center and restaurants. We definitely will return. </DOC> Having driven through a terrible snow storm and fighting thick slush for over an hour back in Virginia, needless to say we didn't make our planned destination of Lumberton, NC. We turned in at Smithfield and found this really nice, clean Sleep Inn. Great price using AARP. Large well apointed room with a large refrigerator, etc. Fantastic king size bed, great attractive bedding and room was super clean."

SUMMARY:  b'Runningm and i are so glad to have stayed at this hotel and would highly recommend and stay here if we are in the area and would recommend it to anyone who is wanting to go to the city and to see the fireworks .</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'This hotel appeared very nice when we first checked in, and they offered a manager\'s reception, which was nice at the end of a long travel day. The room was well appointed, and would compare to a HIE, with the exception of perhaps somewhat less expensive furnishings. Breakfast, however, did not compare. La Quinta (first time I\'ve stayed in one) has not discovered that serving drinks from a small pitcher will not allow you to serve large groups of people. The selection was pretty meager, and the layout was not terribly conducive to a big group trying to eat at once. The "feel" of the hotel is that it will be nice for a year or two, but will drop off quickly after that. I would stay here again, but would read reviews closely before I made a trip next year. </DOC> Nice hotel. Clean, welcoming, rooms have all amenities, ample parking, fitness centre and Indoor pool. Wifi works well and shower good. Breakfast ok and seating area sizeable. Unfortunately fitness centre was closed for repairs. Location is ok. But had to drive to a restaurant. Complimentary food and drinks between 5 and 7 was a lovely added touch. </DOC> We like this hotel as we travel with our small dog. They permit pets in any room on any floor and there is never a pet odor or evidence a pet has been in the room. The room carpets are starting to look a little worn but everything is very clean. Breakfast was different from the fold over eggs and offered French toast and sausages along with the other toasts, yogurt and fruit offerings </DOC> We arrived during a horrendous thunderstorm. Any shelter would have been nice but we were all pleasantly surprised with the quality of this hotel: large, clean, modern rooms with minimal noise. My only complaint would be the unhelpful staff when we asked for restaurant suggestions. </DOC> we had a lg king room with full length mirror always a plus breakfast good with many flavors of yogurt waffles sausage potatoes Front desk youngman asked if they could of done anything better nice touch i would stay here again very clean </DOC> Discovered this place back in 2011 when traveling from MN to Seattle. We do this trip infrequently, but when we do we travel with our dog and usually stop in Bismarck. We use the La Quinta here every time and have not been disappointed. Convenient, clean, comfortable. Great location, too. We stopped here 2X this month and will use this location again. </DOC> We had a nice room on the 3rd floor. however our dog did not like the elevator ride and this made it difficult to get her outside to meet her needs. Speaking of the elevator, it seems like it may be time for adjustments as it took excessive time to find the exact position at the floor so the door would open. </DOC> I stayed in this hotel for three nights recently. Everything was really nice from the decor to the breakfast. The lobby area is very attractive with a fireplace in the wall separating the entry from a lounge area. The staff provided excellent help. I\'d stay there again.'

SUMMARY:  b"this ranks it 's an older hotel with a little bit of a musty smell and decor but the staff members we encountered were very friendly and helpful .room was clean but breakfast was not the best in the area</DOC>"

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"We spent an evening at the Parkland with several friends and were very pleased with the experience. Our room was spacious, clean and overlooked the Bay of Fundy. We went to the Tides Restaurant which is within the hotel and had a meal that was simply fantastic. The stuffed steak and chicken were cooked to perfection. The salad with the feta and blueberry sauce was original and tasty. Finished the meal with their cheesecake and hummingbird cake - both were excellent. Service throughout the stay was exceptional - this included the check-in, bar and the restaurant. </DOC> I booked this motel based on tripadvisor reviews. We booked a 2 bedroom room that was very spacious and clean. The location is great but very noisy at night. Lots of trucks on the road and boats loading and unloading. We ate dinner at the onsite restaurant. The food was very good but the service was so so. The wi fi didn't work and the water pressure in the shower was very weak. We ate bkfst across the street (just inside a general store). It was less expensive and had a wider selection than the onsite restaurant. After leaving Alma we went down Fundy Trail and there were lots of quaint inns we drove by. Next time I would check out one of those. </DOC> Alma is a wonderful place to stop and stay to see the Bay of Fundy tides and this Inn is right on the cove where all the action is. We stayed in rooms 302 and 304 -- 304 faces the Bay and has a little balcony. The rooms were simple but very clean. The owners are great -- very friendly and attentive and made sure we had a good table at dinner. Loved the restaurant -- great fresh seafood. Make sure to walk out on the beach at low tide and watch people dig for clams and look at all the things that the tide has left then sit on your balcony and watch the white caps form as the tide comes in. Visit the docks when the lobster boats come in at high tide -- very cool. We also loved the drive from St. John. </DOC> We stayed in Ocean View King #204 on the second floor. All staff were great! The manager even helped schlep our bags to our room since there was no elevator. Hotel was quiet, clean, and comfortable. Our room was large with WiFi, refrigerator, and small TV. Downstairs at the hotel's Tides restaurant, I enjoyed superb Seafood Pie while my husband had the Seafood Platter while overlooking the Bay. Breakfast was not served so we walked a block to Kelly's Bake Shop for sticky buns. Our stay in Alma enabled us to visit Hopewell Rocks both at high and low tides. However, we should have stayed longer to fully enjoy the Fundy National Park and all the area has to offer. </DOC> Strange, I thought I had written this review. That's jet lag for you!A perfect location on the seafront- go for a sea view. It is an inn so there are hard work floors and a balcony outside. The restaurant is excellent and the continental breakfast okay. I had just arrived in hummingbird season too. My room had a separate lounge and free wi fi (why dont we have that in England as standard?). I would stay there again as it is a great base for Fundy National and Hopewell Rocks. Unfortunately it was too foggy the next day to do the scenic route around the coast. Next time! </DOC> We spent one night at the Parkland Village Inn before visiting Fundy National Park. Some of the positives: good location that is within walking distance to several restaurants & a couple of stores; the room was very clean; the bed was comfortable. A few things to consider: no A/C which normally wouldn't be a big deal but it was particularly muggy while we were there; our room was noisy at night (traffic and some sort of odd thumping coming from the downstairs); complimentary breakfast was very basic. If you stay here, request a room on the bay side, not the road side. We didn't eat at the restaurant for dinner but the menu looked interesting (in a good way!) </DOC> We stayed two nights in Alma and the inn is well located on the main street close to the fishing harbour and other shops and restaurants. We had a second floor sea view room with a compact balcony (two plastic patio chairs completed the balcony furnishings). This room did give a good view of the sea and the extent that the tide goes out in the Bay of Fundy. Breakfast was extra and was unavailable the first morning due to technical reasons with hot water. We went across the road and had a good breakfast. We did have breakfast on the final day and this was great. Parking is easy, in front of the hotel or just to one side. There is a small bar, but this usually seemed quiet. There is no air con but opening a window lets plenty of fresh sea air in and it seems sufficient for the local temperatures. </DOC> We had made our reservations months in advance and 3 days before our scheduled arrival Tingo called to say they were fully booked. Fortunately, Tingo found us a room at the Captain's Inn just across the street because the location was important to us. I can't believe an inn could get away with this. They shouldn't!"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b"this was the last visit and we were pleasantly surprised with the location and the great views from the room above average and very clean beds are comfortable & the buffet breakfast is acceptable .all good for the price , good location , right off the highway but not much to do in the area , food & service is very limited ( no breakfast spread ) but an applebees ( we do n't know ) will be back</DOC>"

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"Did a two night break which included breakfast, a free three course dinner worth \xc2\xa346 one night, \xc2\xa320 to spend in bar, free tickets - we chose Bletchley Park worth another \xc2\xa335 - too good to be true I thought but it was all near perfect. We upgraded to a bigger room that was massive, great facilities, huge towels, fridge, real milk on request. Dinner and Breakfast were all good, bar cosy, big lounge with huge soft sofas....totally recommend. Knocked off one star due to checkout when had to argue to get \xc2\xa320 off bar bill, we were told we had to show the drinks voucher to get the freebie but on arrival we were told they didn't have the vouchers and they'd simply knock off bill. No Bicester shopping village vouchers given either but listed as part of offer. All in all though just really good. </DOC> Friendly atmosphere in this attractive county town hotel. Excellent room (110) nice big bed and and decor. Only downside is that there is no wifi in that area of the hotel. Nice bar and staff. Good real ales. Breakfast is really good too. Easy own parking in courtyard and behind the hotel. Well worth a stay. </DOC> We got married here and decided to visit for our anniversary meal. We had a delicious three course meal, the staff were so warm and welcoming, as was Jean, the fantastic hotel manager. They treated us to a drink and we got a card from all the staff. They put real effort in to make our night feel very special. </DOC> My husband and I dropped in here mid-journey for lunch. Luckily for us it was a great choice. The service was excellent regarding staff, time serving our drinks and food etc. We had chicken Caesar salad and club sandwich which came with chips. The food was very well presented and everything was good quality and very fresh. My husband had large lager and I had two black coffees which were cheaper than most but excellent tasting and presentation. Good value for money and pleasant, clean surroundings. </DOC> Stayed just one night after visiting National Trust properties in Warwick area. Trying to stay in every County town so this was a tick for Bucks. Good size room with large bed, two chairs and good size bathroom with lovely hot water. Ate in restaurant good meal and good breakfast choice. </DOC> Myself and my wife have stayed hear several times over the past two years. Every time we stay we are always greeted with a smile a genuine pleased to see you. The rooms are very comfortable and have a small fridge in most of them which means you can have proper milk in the morning with tea. The rooms are always very clean and all the staff right down to the cleaner's are always friendly and helpful. Out of all the hotels we stayed in this is my favourite. </DOC> Stayed at the Villiers by chance in a Saturday after some confusion with another hotel booking. The staff found us a room even though there was a function and they were very full. The room was clean and spacious despite being over the bar area the room was quiet . The decor of the room is quite old world but this did not bother is . The bed was very comfortable and I would recommend the Villiers as a good place to stay at the centre of Buckingham </DOC> The staff were excellent, and there is free wi-fi in all the bedrooms. My room was large and well furnished, with large bath and nice smellies. At \xc2\xa355 on laterooms, it was terrific value - you can eat out in the local restaurants if you don't fancy the hotel fare, and there is loads of free parking. Breakfast is cooked to order and was great (fish if you don't want full English). My only issues were the old style bedding (not duvets), hard pillows, and a very old tv set. Time to upgrade Villiers !"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:  b"nestled well with a great location and close to the town centre and the rooms were very clean and well maintained .lovely views from the window !however , we were told that they did n't have car parking so we could walk to the castle which was n't worth it .</DOC>"

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"We stayed for the third time in a year and enjoyed our stay. We found our room to be lovely and clean as usual. We stayed in the new wing which is situated conviently for the gym and spa and also the brassiere. The food was lovely, staff friendly, we will return again. We have joined the breakaway club and booked to stay at the hotel in York at the end of this month. </DOC> If you read my previous reviews of crewe hall you'll see I have mixed opinions but thos stay was amazing. It was really nice the staff were all great. We booked a romantic one night stay we have Lanson champagne, hotel chocolat chocolates, the room was nice and clean. We had evening meal in the brasserie which was again very nice. I enjoyed the breakfast but they only had fried eggs, I prefer scrambled but they did offer do me some which I thought was lovely. Keep up the good work Crewe Hall. </DOC> Agree with the negative comments already posted. Unfortunately I have to return for another 2 visits before Summer (my company must have got a good rate). Old building looks great and very interesting to look round. That's the end of the good comments. Found staff generally unhelpful and uninterested. Most of the rooms are located in the new part of the site and these are all of the boring business class style you could find in any business hotel in any any town in Europe. Rooms very badly lit. What are they trying to hide? Service pathetically slow in the Brasserie and portions unacceptably small. Breakfast of self-service buffet style and of service station quality. Not worth the money. </DOC> Stayed here for 5 nights on business and was thoroughly pleased. From check in to check out the service was excellent and the building is a fantastic mix of history and modern design. Pros: -Service was excellent -Breakfast was great standard -Rooms are good size. New wing have modern business rooms, old building has quirky spacious rooms. -Excellent gym and spa facility Cons -Need a car to get here </DOC> Beautiful building with many interesting features. Mostly rebuilt in 19th Century following a fire. Former home of the Crewe family. And it has a chapel! We stayed in the new extension in a spacious comfortable room. Very good night's sleep. Conference dinner food was nothing special. Magical place. Plenty of character . Imposing exterior. </DOC> My friend and I had a really delicious afternoon tea in the Sheridan Lounge. The surroundings are elegant, the service attentive and the food delicious. There is a good selection of tea which is frequently refreshed, and the finger sandwiches, delicate cakes and scones are a treat. Coffee drinkers are catered for and nothing was too much trouble for the waitresses. Highly recommended for a special occasion or a treat. </DOC> Second visit and will come back. Very well located for NW England and offers everything I need for a short business stay. Friendly staff, free wifi, lots of parking. large very clean room, comfortable bed, good range of light, great showers and very pleasant surroundings. Room service was fast and food great and good value. Breakfast good and varied selection on the usual buffet arrangement. Not yet tried the pool but hopefully will next time. </DOC> You cant help but be impressed when approaching this hotel.The setting is lovely. The checkin area in the old part of the building gives the feel of this wonderful hall. The rooms ( we were in the new part) were clean, spacious and had the usual tv, drinks, hairdryer, iron and a good selection of complimentary bathroom cosmetics.. We attended for a christmas party the food was good and the service excellent. We visited the spa and pool and all this area is to a high standard. Breakfast is buffet and has a large choice, again all very nice. Tips for the hotel management : If you have a party for 300 people you need a dance floor that is larger than a postage stamp. You also need a dj that can inject some life and enthusiasm into a party. Anyone can push buttons on a laptop all night."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"We've stayed at this hotel on numerous occasions and since Lakeland Hotels acquired it the standards have got even better. Great public rooms, super food, and delightful grounds. We always take a lake view room and they are very comfortable, well furnished and good bath/shower rooms although not the largest. Staff are very helpful although most in the restaurant seem eastern european so language can be a little bit of a problem sometimes. However, we will most certainly continue to go back as often as possible as we love the Lake District so much and this hotel enhances our stay. </DOC> This was our first time at The Ladore and we were very Happy.All the staff were first class and every effort was made to make our 2 day stay a very enjoyable one.Excellent value as a special 2 day break with Tea and scones on arrival.The indoor pool was very good for such a small hotel. The location is excellent at the edge of The Lake and entrance to The Barrowdale Valley which is well worth Exploring for it's beautifull scenery.The Honister Pass is superb as is the Honister Slate Mine which is well worth the exhilerating drive or walk if you are very fit. Our room was very clean and well serviced and the food was first class.A nice touch was that the hot breakfast was served to your table normally only done at 5 star hotels. Well done to The Ladore we will return. </DOC> The hotel is in a fantastic area and the food that is served in the hotel is fantastic,as for the price you pay your better of flying to scotland it would cost you less and you would get a whole lot more for you money,the hotel is getting very tired and as for the lift you can just get two people in with a squeeze and the bedroom upgrade for a lake veiw and you get a room thats out of date with basic coffee and tee,so i guess it would be fair to say its over priced and you can go 100 yards up the road for 70% less. </DOC> This place is in a lovely location overlooking the lake, great for walking around Derwentwater & has the Lodore falls within the grounds. Staff welcoming & the hotel is dog friendly, but you can only sit in the library area, not the bar. Our stay was DBB & the food was excellent </DOC> We have always wanted to stay at the Lodore and at last we had the opportunity. We were so impressed, we had an absolutely lovely night and want to return. Staff all friendly and helpful. Room beautifully decorated and superb view of the lake. The whole hotel is luxury, sitting in the lounge looking out on the lake drinking aperitifs, was just bliss. Evening meal, most courses excellent but sea bass overcooked, however the whole experience was just so lovely. Breakfast was extremely good, lovely fresh fruit. We really loved it and our favourite so far in the Borrowdale valley. </DOC> We really enjoyed our stay in this beautiful hotel in a fabulous location. Our suite was stunning and spacious with beautiful views of the lakeland fells and Derwent water. The bar areas were busy and had a lovely warm atmosphere. As mentioned by other guests the hotel is undergoing an extensive development and I would love to go back later in the year to explore the new facilities. The only let down for us was the restaurant dining in the evening.The restaurant itself is newly refurbished and is beautifully decorated. We were seated at our chosen time of 7pm but had completed all three courses by 7.45pm. It was like speed-dining! Unfortunately for us the lasting memories were not of how enjoyable the meal was but the fact that the pace was so fast we were unable to savour the experience. </DOC> We booked the Lodore Falls hotel with Travelzoo,and for the price we paid everything proved to be perfectly adequate. Don't expect Michelin starred food here as it's all very production line quality and the restaurant lacks any sense of intimacy. The rooms have been tastefully decorated and the beds are very comfortable. Not sure we would stay here without a deal,and certainly wouldn't dine here if it wasn't included as a package. </DOC> Just back from our first walking break in the Lakes. We stayed one night and found the hotel very comfortable. Beautiful lake view room, wonderful bathroom. Upon our return from walking we were welcomed and enjoyed a lovely evening meal in the restuarant. The menu was different with a choice of 4 main courses, none of which were what we would normally order, but chose goose and it was lovely. There is a small indoor pool, a beauty salon, an outdoor pool and tennis court and lots of lovely comfortable sofas with plenty of reading materials and fires to relax by. I think we'll be back."

SUMMARY:  b"this ranks our last visit to the hotel we were very happy with the location and the fabulous views and lovely grounds and the great hotel staff are so friendly and helpful .do n't mind the price of the hotel but it is not worth it ..but it was n't worth the price paid for it ( the two nights we stayed at the resort ) and it was a bit of a rip off ( but not worth it ) only 3 stars would be a little more</DOC>"

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"Just stopped for a drink and found the staff very friendly. Great location with some lovely walks on the door step. Menu looked nice but we didn't have anything to eat. There is a pay phone for use as no wifi in the area </DOC> We stayed here for one night when walking across the Lake District. No problem for a one night stay, drying room for our very wet boots and a very nice bedroom with wonderful views. The evening meal, taken in a busy bar so take up the offer of a reserved table, was superb with several vegetarian choices. Breakfast and packed lunch equally good. </DOC> In good pub guide so, must try ,truly at the end of the road, interesting menu ,roaring fire,and homely atmosphere. Light lunch, Duck terrine and Avocado and Cray fish salad with a glass of Crabbies, all delicious Felt slightly guilty,rolling up by car, as this is obviously a fell walkers hostelry . </DOC> Spending Easter weekend in the Lakes and meet up with my Mam and Step Dad and wanted a traditional country pub to eat at and this looked to fit the bill. We arrived early and as the table was still occupied we went through to the bar for a drink, the place was busy and had a great atmosphere. staff very good and worked hard but food was poor - large cod and chips at nearly \xc2\xa3 16 was just not on when clearly not fresh and covered in copious amounts of old batter to hide the fact ! The chips were re-heated. There was no comparison to meal we had next evening at a number one hotel where we paid the same amount for a main course . Think this place has a bit of a captive market as in middle of nowhere next to a campsite - maybe campers have no other choice ! </DOC> This traditional pub in a very small village is a surprise. Extremely well renovated with modern ensuite bathrooms and rooms that have been tastefully decorated. Friendly staff, good meals wish I could have stayed longer. Highly recommended. </DOC> A comfortable stay on the coast to coast walk in a beautiful location. The hotel was clean, rooms well decorated, and beds comfortable, with a good breakfast. There was no TV in the room (which may be a positive to some- but I missed getting the breakfast TV news as I was preparing for my next days walking) but instead a smallish TV in the guest lounge which also had a PC that guests could use at no charge for e-mails etc. The food was good- I chose a battered haddock, which was large, and nice without being spectacular, and priced a little on the expensive side compared with other pubs eaten in on the coast to coast. </DOC> While in the area I came across this pub totally by chance - desperate to find somewhere for dinner I just followed a pub sign which led me along a narrow lane to this pub. Only now have I seen the last few reviews and am surprised by them as my experience over what became three successive evening meals was the exact opposite.....so much so I've been thinking this pub has been the best for me in the UK for outstanding food and I have to say - very friendly service. I'm no pushover and I expect good customer service wherever I go, and what I received here was 10/10 from all the staff including the two men behind the bar. That apart, the location is breathtakingly beautiful. Best to book a table in advance and they are closed on Monday's. </DOC> This is a charming and well run hotel with good food. From checking in to checking out we all thought this was an excellent place to stay. The service team who were predominantly Eastern European boys ( where will we be after Brexit!), were absolutely great, fantastic service from all of them with nice charm and sense of humour which you need after along days walking. Rooms whilst not large were lovely, clean and nicely and brightly decorated. All of our rooms had baths which for walkers is a big bonus. The restaurant has a lovely feel about it and food quality and service was excellent."

SUMMARY:  b"Marvelmiguel is a beautiful and well located pub next to the old town and very well maintained with a great staff who were courteous and helpful in the hotel .food was fine ...the view from the balcony could be better but the staff did n't know what to do and the breakfast was good</DOC>"

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"If you want to be right in the centre of town, this is the place to stay. It has a small car park but we managed to park o.k. The rooms are fitting to the hotel, which was built around the early 1900's to service the train station. We stayed in a four poster bedroom. The rooms are of an old fashioned style with old style furniture and fittings so if you want modern, I wouldnt recommend it, although the bathroom appeared to be recently refurbished. Breakfast was included in the price and was a really good freshly prepared with all the trimmings of a full breakfast. One of the best breakfasts I have had for a while in a hotel. We didnt eat in the hotel, but the restaurant looked really nice and the food selection appertising. Friendly greeting and helpful personnel. </DOC> Stayed for one night the other week whilst catching up with a friend and prior to a weekend at Alton Towers. Really enjoyed it. The owner checked us in and carried our case from our car to our room. Really nice room with a very comfortable four poster bed, couch and clean, large bathroom. Great selection of tea, coffee and biscuits in the room, also bottled water. Breakfast was cooked to order and was first class. There was a good selection of cereals to start but the cooked breakfast was more than enough for us. Will stay again very soon. </DOC> The hotel is lovely old school, it's not a Holiday Inn. Lovely setting across the road from the Tissington tunnel which is a lovely walk. 2 miles up the walk is the lovely pub called the Old Dog. The breakfast was very good with everything you would want at a high quality. The rooms were all different including a couple of 4 poster beds. Ashbourne is a very nice place to visit and a good base to visit Dovedale </DOC> A group of us stayed here for a night. The welcome we received was lovely. The owner was so friendly and instantly we knew we'd made the right choice. The rooms are all different. I had a four poster bed with a beautiful view. Whilst the floorboards are a little creaky, it's part of the charm of this place. Nice breakfast too. Would stay here again. Good value too. </DOC> Conveniently located in Ashbourne, not far from Dovedale, Ilam and other attractions. A large room, well-furnished with sofa and four post bed. Friendly welcome. Very good breakfast. Good value overall. Shower on top floor low water pressure but the owner says they will be investing in refurbishments. The bed was a bit squeaky but I slept really well. I would certainly stay there again. </DOC> We stayed for one night in October 2010 in a mixed group of 7 visiting Alton Towers. The hotel was very well located (20 mins to Alton Towers) and the manager couldn't have been more helpful. Breakfast was well prepared, presented and served and we couldn't really have hoped for more. Free parking was also available at the back of the hotel. I'd happily stay again. Ashbourne itseld wasn't inspiring - a few pubs for dinner and drinks but as a 'get-away with mates' stop you'd be pushed to find better. </DOC> We stayed at The Station Hotel for a night whilst we were house hunting in Ashbourne. We have now moved here and the friendly nature of this hotel is symptomatic of the town itself. Set in a building with character, the hotel offers a great central location, clean comfortable rooms and a good breakfast. It is well priced and we found the manager to be friendly and welcoming. Recommended. </DOC> Stayed here for two nights and enjoyed our stay the staff really look after you. Being lactose intolerant we had informed the hotel that I had a problem with dairy products and after we arrived they phoned the room to check whether I needed any special products that they could get for my breakfast. On the second day I ordered a boiled egg for breakfast and they asked how long I wanted it cooking for, great attention to detail. The hotel is situated about two minute walk from the centre of Ashbourne and is well placed for visiting other towns in Derbyshire. It has a relaxing lounge and bar area and the whole hotel has great character with the choice of furnishings complimenting the building."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"This Hampton is much like the others in the chain and is all that is expected of it. Great location; the staff was excellent, and the rooms were up to par. Biggest Positive - Staff. All the staff I encountered were excellent and were very willing to help and serve Biggest Negative - and this is just to be picky - the breakfast lacked a little. It was good, but maybe i was looking for a little more out of a Hampton (again, I'm just being picky). Would certainly stay at this location again next time I visit the Cleveland area on business. </DOC> Family overnight in Cleveland. Hotel was just what you expect from Hampton (don't they all look alike?) Check-in was friendly and helpful. Room was clean, comfortable and quiet. Breakfast was good. Played it safe for dinner, but had many options in the area. Convenient to downtown (1/2 hour away). Only complaint is the wimpy hair dryer in the room. </DOC> The Hotel is easy to access from the highway. It is easy to see the sights of Cleveland making this the home base. It was clean and serviced properly during the stay. Good sized room and bathroom. The breakfast was good, with some variety. Staff was great and always ready to help. Recommend this Hampton if in Cleveland. </DOC> This property was in area only 30 minutes from downtown and was the most convenient for my trip. Easy freeway access with good restaurants near by. Staff was friendly and very helpful with needs. Will stay there again if in Cleveland area. </DOC> Chose Hampton over the usual group of hotels for a conference simply because I find them more reliable than the rest of the group and I was not disappointed. Arrived in heavy rain and left in 3+ inch deep snow and as soon as I got into the lobby everything warmed up. Usual quality room and facilities, satisfactory breakfast and papers and all that. Happy to choose Hampton and will do so again. </DOC> We almost exclusively stay at Hampton Inns when we are traveling and are rarely disappointed. This property did not meet our expectations for two primary reasons - noise and poor mattress quality. We thought it was odd that there were complimentary ear plugs on the night stand and then figured out why when we could hear the neighboring room's television and very early in the morning heard their shower. Also, the mattress was very soft and in obvious need of being replaced. The location of the hotel is convenient to the highway, the breakfast buffet is adequate and the staff were friendly. Next time we will either stay across the street at the Courtyard by Marriott, which we have stayed at before, or go across the highway to the Embassy Suites. </DOC> This Hampton was one of the best I have stayed at this year! New clean and fresh. Staff was very helpful. Would love to stay there again if in the area. Just ask for a room opposite the freeway I think thats the even #'s. I had 604 and it was very nice </DOC> Was booked into the Hampton by my company for a four day business trip. Had never been to the Cleveland area before so knew nothing about the area. The hotel is located in the suburbs of Cleveland and located in a newer area with other hotels and restaurants directly nearby, The locations i very convenient. The hotel staff was very friendly and the room was clean and comfortable. Coffee bar 24 x 7 as well as a full breakfast included each morning is a nice amenity. The hotel has everything a business traveler could need . Definitely recommend it."

SUMMARY:  b'Marvelmulr motel is a great place to stay and have a few shopping malls and restaurants in the area and a few places to eat nearby and the reception was very helpful and allowed us to check in early .the room was ok but was not up to the hilton standards in the area</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"Nice, new, neat. Great location for univ. Hosp., Cleve clinic and case western. Rooms are beautiful and spacious. Bathroom shower is awesome.The downside is valet parking only. Walk to little Italy for dinner and pastries. Lovely weekend. </DOC> This is probably the most upscale Courtyard I have ever stayed in. I was immediately recognized as a Platinum Elite member and was given the extra Rewards points and a choice of anything from the market, a nice touch. The one problem I have with this hotel is the mandatory valet parking at $20.00 a day. An idea would be to provide free parking for Marriott Platinum members. The rooms here are awesome and they is plenty of restaurants choices within walking distance. The Cleveland Clinic Med Ctr is just down the street. </DOC> A great hotel at a convenient location. Room was immaculate, staff was professional. Breakfast at the Bistro was quick and convenient. An option for self-parking would be nice, but the parking staff provided quick and efficient service. </DOC> This is a relatively standard Courtyard Marriott. Pros of the place: very convenient location to Case Western campus, many nearby restaurants and attractions, very quiet, good size rooms that were laid out with an eye to comfort and convenience for working. WiFi worked well. Cons: Was surprised by the lack of attention to cleanliness. For instance, very clearly neither the toilet in my bathroom nor the floor of the shower was cleaned. There is no room service which can be inconvenient if you've arrived late and want a bite to eat. Have to pay for valet parking. </DOC> While attending a wedding in Cleveland, we stayed at the Marriott Courtyard in University Circle. It is very near Case Western and multiple hospitals. You can conveniently walk to many attractions including museums and music. The building is new so it was disappointing to see the rooms and public areas already starting to show some wear. Our room was one of their larger ones but it had only a shower and no bathtub. The only parking is via valet with the drop off and pick up area too small to handle the traffic flow. If you can do without a car and walk to your destination, the location can't be improved. There are many places to eat nearby so you can forego the onsite, ordinary, bistro. </DOC> Good location to Case and Cleveland clinic. Wonderful complimentary shuttle to take you to clinics, restaurants. Don't eat there, service is too slow. There is a Starbucks across the street for breakfast and great restaurants in nearby Little Italy. The hotel could use microwaves in the room and a functional fireplace as well. </DOC> Too pity that it is a courtyard but not full Marriott. Basically, this hotel was good: the location is good the staff was helpful, however the swimming pool was a joke and it is a pricey hotel Parking is valet only and $18/day. Call them in advance if u need your car. There are not so many options for the breakfast, but I waited 30 min to get my food. Only 2 staff was working at the counter and I believe one of them was a trainee... She was struggling to handle all requests.. There was big park nearby which may holding weekday concert in summer night. That was very cool and there was some yummy French restaurants nearby. </DOC> This is a relatively new hotel with excellent amenities and very friendly, helpful staff. There's a nice lounge/restaurant area with good options for breakfast and dinner, plus a Starbucks next door and several other restaurants within walking distance. They also offer a nice shuttle service to the museum and other spots within a 2-3 mile radius. Overall a wonderful place to stay at a reasonable price."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'When I checked in the person who took me to the room said "It\'s a Marriott, everything is as it usually is". I agree. It was a typical Marriott experience. Everything was as usual. Nothing to criticize in the room (except that I could clearly hear people coming and going in the hallways as I was trying to sleep), but also no wow. However, the lobby is currently under heavy construction and it\'s noisy, dusty and confusing. </DOC> Beautiful hotel in great location. Good weekend deal including breakfast Room was spacious and clean, bedding luxurious and bath products high quality Staff were very friendly and added to the stay Would recommend to anyone </DOC> Something went terribly wrong at check in. Still a mystery to me as I was a part of a group reservation and provided my Marriott Rewards card and my credit card. The hotel security attempted nearly successfully to break into my room at 1:30 in the morning. The hotel did their best to make it up to me. I am still at a loss as to how this could have happened without as much as a phone call prior to attempting forceable entry. </DOC> I cannot remember when we last stayed in a Marriott, but this turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. The hotel was completely full being Labor Day weekend, the air show, and numerous weddings. But the staff was a delight and we even snagged a lake is room. The room was nicely furnished, had a really good shower, and the view and downtown location was perfect. Plus the very reasonable package included tickets to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, parking and breakfast! I was impressed and It was a perfect start to a two week driving trip. </DOC> Well located in Cleveland with easy access to riverfront, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The hotel public rooms are undergoing some refurbishment at the moment and perhaps the rooms will follow. Our room was fine; the standard Marriott comfort but in the older style. Staff were very helpful and courteous. Valet parking is the only realistic option and that worked well \xe2\x80\x93 always adds significantly to the daily rate but worth the security. We were only here one night on our road trip across the US and our sole task was the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame which was an easy walk from the hotel. Mission accomplished! </DOC> Stayed there for 3 nights on business. Nice hotel, well setup room with exception of the entrance to my room. There was a wall right inside the door, so you had to open the door all the way to enter. Since my meetings where a block away the location was great. I would stay there again </DOC> This hotel is convenient as it is located in the Key Bank building and everything is within walking distance. The staff was so nice, friendly and helpful. The rooms though are nothing special. Comfortable but there is nothing about them that was memorable. If it was more expensive than any other hotel downtown I would not say it was worth it. However, the staff did make it very enjoyable. The Starbucks accessible via indoor access to the Key Center lobby was nice given how cold it gets in Cleveland. </DOC> This scored among the Top 25 in Trip Advisor\'s Travelers\' Choice for 2010 for the US. I thought it was very good for the money. I saw that some of the negative reviews referred to concerns about valet parking and a questionable neighborhood. After booking, I asked management about it and they a) responded and b) promised I\'d be satisfied. I was. Since we weren\'t going to the Hall of Fame, I didn\'t take that package, which was a better value than the one I took that included breakfast and parking. Still good deal.'

SUMMARY:  b'nestled in the hotel is a bit difficult to find and was tricky to find as i had to go to the front desk for a few days and the staff were very helpful and friendly .room is spacious , spacious and clean but the worst part of this hotel is the location , not a great option for the price</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'I\'m really becoming a huge of fan of these places. This was our final stop before moving into our new home in about 20 miles away. This property is located in the Grandview Heights section of the city but close enough to downtown that it\'s easy to drive to most places. It\'s a lot of quality amenities for your dollar. This is a fairly new property that is well maintained. Rooms are a very good size for a family of four and nicely decorated and functional. Breakfast here is a cut above similar type competing properties. Staff were courteous and helpful. This place has a nice indoor pool with huge doors that open out to a patio and while we were there they were open. We ate dinner in the patio while swimming. If you are in Columbus and need a great place to stay this is it. </DOC> Spent 2 nights here at the Hyatt Place and had a great time. Close to everything we needed. Walking distance to OSU. Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Great covered parking right across the street ( a big plus if the weather was poor!). Clean, new and overall just great! </DOC> Stayed here for a quick 1-night stay before an OSU football game and would definitely come back. The hotel is very new in an industrial part of town that is being modernized. There\'s nothing nearby in terms of a neighborhood or restaurants, but the hotel itself is beautiful. It\'s a very short drive to the OSU campus or to the Short North neighborhood for restaurants. Our double queen room had a large sitting area with a desk. The sink is outside of the bathroom which is a feature I always appreciate. A very nice hot breakfast was served including breakfast "mcmuffin" sandwiches, fruit, yogurt and cereals. The hotel ran a shuttle to OSU game. </DOC> This is the hotel we stay at when we are in Columbus for medical care. It is quiet and still very close to the hospital. Breakfast is plentiful and varied. Wish the coffee were hotter! WIFI works well! </DOC> Stayed here for one night and meeting. Room was excellent with new or nearly new appearance and very appealing layout. Bed was comfortable. TV was very large for a hotel room. Breakfast was complimentary and was the standard faire for free breakfast buffets. Not particularly impressive but there was something for everyone and the eating area seemed to have plenty of room. I didn\'t use the pool or exercise facilities but the pool appeared nice enough (indoor). Parking was under cover across from the hotel (short distance). There was a restaurant right next door. This is in a new area of construction and so there isn\'t any particular views. It is close enough to OSU to gather traffic for big game days. It is also close to downtown relatively. There are nearby areas with good restaurants beside the one next to the hotel. Short drives to those. </DOC> My husband and I frequently visit Columbus and have stayed in Polaris and the OSU area. I chose Hyatt Place due to its location to our daughter\'s apartment and downtown Columbus. It was the perfect choice! The location couldn\'t be better to downtown, campus, etc. The hotel has a very nice staff, easy and quick check-in, awesome rooms, and a very nice complementary breakfast, as well as snacks for purchase. The hotel offers covered parking, too! Though close to the Short North and downtown eateries, there\'s a fun OSU bar and grill next door as well as a deli. I highly recommend this hotel. We will be back! </DOC> The room and amenities are on what one would typically expect for a Hyatt Place--that minimalist modern look. The bed was firm but comfortable. The hotel rooms were nice because we met up with friends who were also staying here to go to a restaurant and the layout meant it was comfortable for everyone to congregate in one room without feeling like we were encroaching on the sleeping areas of our friends. The breakfast was pretty stellar. I loved the English muffins with the ham and cheese on them, best complementary hot breakfast ever! </DOC> I stayed at this hotel three separate times this summer while in Columbus for work. The location was convenient for me, near both downtown and OSU. You can walk to eat at Jason\'s Deli, Hofbrauhaus, or the Buckeye Grill right next door. The hotel was clean and well maintained. The a/c worked perfectly. The internet was sufficiently fast. Breakfast was good as usual at Hyatt Place. My only issue was a long wait to check in upon a late arrival for my last trip, but that\'s a minor issue and not enough to drop my rating.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"The lobby, the rooms and the restaurants are well appointed and maintained. This is probably the niccest hotel in Longyearbyen center... I found the breakfast to be OK, but not as nice as the buffet of the Radisson (where I stayed on my last visit)... There is no minibar, no rooms service and no access to anything to eat besides peanuts when one is hungry at night, that was a rather disappointing issue for me as I was hungry on one eve as we had returned from an excursion where only a light dinner was served. Wifi was much slower than at the Radisson. Other than that, was fairly happy with my stay. </DOC> I have stay for one night at Svalbard Hotel during my one day visit in Svalbard. The hotel is clean and the staff was great! We also have breakfast but it is served right across Svalbard Hotel, at Svalbard Lodge! By the way it is more than enough! Svalbard is really an one life time place to visit! Yes it is very expensive but you must try to be there! </DOC> We stayed here before and after our adventure cruise of Svalbard. The good things are the breakfast and the large comfortable rooms. Staff were friendly as well. It's actually split into 2 buildings and the annex is across the road. Only problem is you have to drag bags across deep gravel which is a pain...literally. </DOC> Great location in the middle of the village and a short walk to everywhere. Very modern room and bathroom. Nice place to have coffee and biscuits whenever you like. I went down early in the morning and sat around in my pyjames (sorry to all the other guests who saw me!) Breakfast across the road is very reasonable. Free wi-fi. Service by all the receptionists was very friendly and helpful. </DOC> The small hotel is new, the rooms with bathrioom are fine, however, most of TV channels only in Norwegian (but who came to watch TV to Svalbard anyway...) and the location is just downtown. The minus is that there is no fridge in the room. The abundant included breakfast is served in another building. Eat a lot, so you will survice to the evening. In the dark time (Nov-Feb) the reception is opent only between 8 am - 4 pm, so take your chance to chat with the helpful personnel in the morning. I think the price / quality is fine to the Svalbard context. </DOC> We stayed here for one night, arriving as most do at about 0130, and left the following afternoon. Everything was very nice including the well stocked buffet breakfast. The rooms are well equipped and there are blackout blinds, which you probably need if you travel in the summer. </DOC> The hotel is nestled inside the Main Street of the town with easy access to the pub and shops, the check-in process is easy and given a keycard with the room code on. As the rooms where not ready there is soup and bread available to warm up. The hotel staff are friendly, the rooms are very well decorated and in good condition and the food is delicious. If your going to Svalbard stay here and book the tours as a package. </DOC> This is a very comfortable hotel on the main street in Longyearbyen.Close to shops and restaurants and the COOP supermarket. Nice rooms , very comfortable bed, good bathroom. Good size and good wifi. Nice buffet breakfast and good restaurant. Very friendly and efficient staff. Well recommended."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'Check-in was on slow side even though there was no queue!! We had paid for an upgrade to king size bed but what we were offered was a double bed in a bulk standard room with a sky light window...not happy. Duty manager sorted out the problem without fuss. The porter (Harry) was very helpful and a good ambassador for the hotel. Our new room in the \'old\' section was fine....although still no king size bed!!! Dinner was excellent and the hotel treated our party of 6 to complimentary glasses of Prosecco a nice gesture. Breakfast was fine and the staff were pleasant and courteous. Dinner on our second night again met our expectations and good quality food. The grounds are pleasant to stroll around. Spa facilities OK . The staff we encountered were always pleasant, friendly, helpful and professional. </DOC> We stayed as two couples (and a Border Terrier) for one night midweek and had a great time. The staff were all extremely friendly, helpful and efficient. The hotel itself is beautiful with loads of wonderful nooks and crannies to explore. I\'m not a history buff but still found it all fascinating. We used all the leisure facilities and they are excellent. The food in the restaurant was sublime - best meal we\'ve had in ages! Certainly a place we\'ll be returning to. </DOC> Attended a Conference on a wet, cold & rainy October day , Meeting room well signposted, Room itself well equipped & roomy , only problem No Heating , very cold. Had a 3 course lunch which was excellent , all of the attendees were positive about the meal . After the conference some of us stayed for a bar meal , \xc2\xa315 for a beefburger & chips is pushing it a bit , nothing special about the meal , no condiments offered , sauces etc. Chips smothered in salt for some reason. Didnt\' spend the night , but for a conference it was OK. </DOC> I\'ve now stayed here for a 2nd time on business. 3 nights this time and I booked a standard Spa room. This was much better than the room I had last time, very nicely furnished and comfortable. The pool is great for a hotel, but the new jacuzzi was a bit weak. I found the restaurant menu expensive for my budget so ate in the bar which was good and reasonably priced. </DOC> Stayed a few times ,nice location beautiful front to hotel then typical boring modern extension at the rear where most rooms are . Some colleagues had noisy pipes making racket all night. We were a group of eight and though the restaurant was almost empty service for dinner was dreadful . Food poor at best with things lukewarm then our table was not cleared for nearly half an hour . Breakfast rubbish , cheap sausages overcooked bacon mushrooms looked a week old and scrambled egg tasted like made of powder . Could and should be much better for a hotel this attractive. </DOC> very enjoyable stay with a good dinner included and the bonus of the spa (swimming pool slightly small would be the only gripe!); we loved the exterior Jacobean architecture and the one real disappointment was that inside there is little evidence of historic fabric </DOC> My first thought when I first saw Redworth Hall was that it looked like a castle in a beautiful country setting. The grounds and gardens are beautifully landscaped. We were given a warm welcome and a very nice, comfortable room that overlooked the courtyard. The hotel is tastefully decorated - I felt like in was in a "Downton Abbey" episode. The bar was a great place to have "Happy Hour" before dinner. Our meals were delicious and service was excellent. I was sorry when we had to leave the next day. </DOC> Got a great deal on the new Puma website for a weekend away. We stayed in room 606 which was an upgraded spa room. The furnishings were excellent and of you can afford it try and upgrade. Breakfast was okay, the usual cooked selection and staff were attentive. Apart from breakfast we didn\'t eat in the hotel but I would recommend both pubs in the nearby village of Heighington.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'This was our first visit to a Premier Inn and I\'ve got to say we were impressed. Room was a good size and very clean. All the staff were very friendly and efficient. We opted to have the breakfast and again it was good. Good value good selection. Would definitely consider staying again. </DOC> Had a one one stay. Room was quiet, clean and comfortable. However there is no control over the temperature and you can\'t open the window. We had breakfast at the hotel which was hot and the buffet serving dishes were small which meant that they had to be constantly refreshed with further supplies of hot fresh food instead of food which had been sitting there for a long time </DOC> Stayed for one night whilst local on a business trip. Room looked fairly recently refurbished, plenty of space with desk and sofa. Was a little overpriced at \xc2\xa380 but not many good options in the local area. </DOC> This is a fairly new inn so everything is in good condition but then it has always been like that in the inn,s I,ve been to the only thing is it\'s the first time I,ve been to one with the restaurant in the same building as the rooms usually it\'s a pub next door although the food was lovely you couldn\'t,t really spend time in there after your meal and if the place was full you would have to go out for a meal as they wouldn\'t, be able to cater for everyone </DOC> You know what you get at a Premier Inn. Good value, comfy beds, good location, helpful staff. Can not complain about anything here. Stayed a couple of nights-not far from the seafront, nesagents down the road and not far from centre. </DOC> Great on site car park. Rooms well planned. Comfortable bed. Restaurant good for breakfast.. not sure about the "bar area" Staff all very good friendly but professional service . So would recommend this hotel. Would return as well. </DOC> Premier Inn always offers a good sleep in familiar surroundings. What is always interesting is the added value of the particular hotel. This one offers a very big and slightly set aside from the road car park, really friendly staff and a good hotel layout. The breakfast had a good range and the specially requested poached eggs were perfectly cooked. Good espresso from the coffee machine also. A good central location near the beach, public swimming baths and a wide range of restaurants. Highly recommended. </DOC> This is a fairly new hotel. Very clean and tidy. Staff were friendly and helpful. Good size free car park. Situated close to the sea front and town center. Ideal as a base to drive to nearby resorts and attractions. Problem with the TV during our stay. Breakfast was disappointing. Food was warm. Not a great choice for the cost. Seats in the lounge area were uncomfortable after a short time.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'I stayed for one night, B&B, as we were attending a Wedding in the nearby Castle. The room was clean but tiny. Smaller than the smallest of rooms we\'ve ever stayed in New York. A city known for its small rooms! The ceiling was so low, my husband felt he couldn\'t stand up straight. In the shower, he had to crouch. The bathroom was equally tiny. The shower gel was lovely though. The bed was big and very comfy. For once, after waking ridiculously early, I managed to get back to sleep. Result! The breakfast wasn\'t that varied but very tasty. It\'s really only a 2 minute walk to the castle, wedding venue so it\'s perfect for wedding guests. </DOC> A difficult place to find if youn have a "Nissan" and rely on their satnav - it takes you to the centre of Coleford several miles away. The hotel confirmed that we are nowhere near the first to experience this problem. Having taken the trouble to find the restaurant we were pleased with the quality of the food / service although it is an expensive lunchtime menu </DOC> We went their on a secret escapes deal, so was good value. We were given an upgrade to their cottage, which is a delightful little bolthole. The rooms are spacious and well fitted out. Facilities and amenities were good. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was excellent. Plenty of parking. Would stay there again, and recommend it to you too. </DOC> My husband and I attended at wedding in Clearwell and we stayed at the Tudor Farmhouse. The property was lovely and the staff was so pleasant and helpful. I requested a room on the ground floor with a shower since I have limited mobility and my request was honored. It was perfect! </DOC> I stayed there as I was working close-by and I must say that this hotel has been very relaxing. Not sure I should call it a hotel as the ambiance is more like the one of a good guest house. You feel at home and I had the impression that my room was the house of Snow White ! The diner was very good and the breakfast was also great with local products. If you are looking for the kind of 5 stars international hotel, this is not your place. But if you are looking for a very charming place, go there ! </DOC> On arrival, we were warmly greeted by the receptionist, who showed us to our lovely spacious room. The taster menu was very good. We finished our one night stay with a hearty breakfast of porridge, followed by scrambled eggs and smoked salmon on crumpets. There is plenty of parking and the room was very well maintained. </DOC> This is a delightful small hotel in the middle of the village. Rooms in differing styles, sizes and prices are scattered in various buildings, all close to the main building. We were in the main building and the small room had charm and character. The very small bathroom was compensated for by the nice large fluffy white towels. The cottage garden made a lovely place to have a delicious cream tea in and then drinks later. Dinner was good too, one night my duck breast was quite exceptional. The staff throughout were excellent and very helpful. </DOC> This has been a \'bolt-hole\' for us for six years now and every stay is more lovely than the last. The staff are wonderful, the food magnificent and the accommodation (we are gradually trying every room) is second to none. Book with confidence and enjoy! (just leave a room for us too)'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"good value for money and decent for a night stay. nothing terrific but again went to see the match and had fun. </DOC> i stayed i night and i thought \xc2\xa328 wAS GOOD VALUE when i got to the hotel in neon light the price was \xc2\xa318 the car park was locked so i had to park my car far far away and yank a heavy suitcase to the hotel. when i complained the front desk said that the ramada hotel next door had locked the car park.this i accepted till a young girl raised merry hell about the carpark being locked and lo and behold the front desk opened the car park BUT I was tired after a long plane journey i left the car where i had parked it but checked out very early as i was worried it would be clamped </DOC> It was clean, smart, and you got what you paid for - nothing more. Its a bit remote but if you have a car than its easy to get to other places, and of course you have the Salford Quays Tram stop across the road if you want to get into the centre of Manchester. Only minus points - room was too hot - couldnt get the air con to blow cool air, so had to switch it off and have the window open - the noise wasnt too bad I wasnt on the tram side. And not sure why you need to pay for parking, its not like its in the centre of a city - so persume its to make money....... </DOC> Well all I can say really is that you get what you pay for and budget means budget. It's very near Salford quays metro station (12 mins from Piccadilly). Bed not particularly comfortable and dinghy toilet cubicle but clean and also friendly staff. Cold breakfast \xc2\xa35.50 additional although there is a BP garage nearby where you can get a bacon roll and coffee for \xc2\xa32.65 (greggs). Fine if you are a single business man and need to save your client money! </DOC> Staff were friendly.. this is all I liked about the hotel it is more like a hostel. The room was too small, the shower had a terrible smell and the tram ran under the window. It was on the second floor even though I had requested a higher floor. It was too far out of the way for us, it just didnt suit us, we had to get taxis everyplace. </DOC> If you're main focus is going to Old Trafford (cricket or football) and don't need 5 star luxury then this is a good hotel to book. It is very basic but very functional (hospital room-like) and the staff are extremely friendly. The only downside I would mention (but an important one) is that the beds are very hard! </DOC> The Ibis is ok for just a night. Room was clean,bathroom/shower tiny but the shower itself was excellent. Seperate toilet. For the price we was satisfied and you can park on site. Small breakfast area. </DOC> Hubbie has stayed here loads for work and this last couple of weeks I've joined him. It does what it says on the tin, it's clean, comfortable and perfectly adequate for what you need. Only one real gripe, it MUST be designed by a man as there is no power anywhere near a mirror. You need to take your own hairdryer but then can't actually plug it in anywhere near a mirror. also the higher up the building it seems the traffic noise is much louder. Overall though, it's great."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'The spa was great, an enjoyable treatment followed by a swim, steam and sauna. Our room was good and had everything we needed, Not a fan of showers in baths and shower curtains it certainly dates the facilities. </DOC> I was very disappointed with the staff in this hotel. The girl who checked me in could not have been more patronising. Her slow monotone tone coupled with the manor in which she painfully explained things was well, painful. The room I had was nice, a good size with personal touches such as milk and robes. The spa facilities looked a little hit and miss so I gave them a miss. I got dinner in my room which was nice but again served by a boy who needed to comb his hair and perhaps wake up before he came to work (odd). All in all a nice hotel but needs to have a new recruitment drive recruiting enthusiastic people. </DOC> I enjoyed a 9 night stay on business, also making use of the Conference facilities. Very good snacks and proper coffee in the "Conference Cafe". Excellent service throughout. Utilized the bar for a variety of evening meals. Staff were attentive and helpful. Room was large and very well appointed - clean and everything working. Free WiFi thoughout. Large car park - free. Hotel owned pub next door with Thwaites ales and all charges able to be booked to room. Lovely fluffy bathrobe in room! I should be using this hotel on several business occasions this year and look forward to this. </DOC> I stayed on business here in January but returned so that I could bring my wife for a leisure break at this great hotel. Service was excellent by the staff who assisted in making this a pleasent long weekend break. All aspects of the hotel were very good, from the food, the pool, the spa team, housekeeping and bar staff. My wife did say however that the room above was a bit noisey with them in and out of the bathroom all night. I did sleep through it all - must have been contented. The complimentory fresh milk and a bottle of water in the fridge were a welcome change. Well done to all involved and thanks </DOC> I stayed here on business, so didn\'t use the spa facilities. The hotel looks lovely from the outside, the interior is very pleasant and the bedrooms are comfortable and well-equipped, with a fluffy bathrobe and nice toiletries. Service from the reception is efficient and helpful. The only let down for me was the food. For a spa hotel, the menu is not exactly healthy, and as a vegetarian there were not many options available for me. For two nights in a row I ate nothing at all. It\'s a shame, as the rest of the experience is nice. More vegetarian, healthy options please! </DOC> Came here for two nights, needed a base for exploring the area. Wanted comfortable room with tub and free parking, check on both. As s scandinavian I\xe2\x80\x99m not used to or a fan of all the carpets everywhere, but this is typical english. Basic breakfast (might be good, depends on what you compare with and in comparison with norwegian standards this was very basic). Would recommend the place if it has what you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for. </DOC> The hotel is located near Whiteley business park, but is not really near anywhere else. There is a pub next door which will charge to the hotel room. Parking is plentiful and free. The wifi works well. A nice touch was the fresh milk left in the fridge - for tea and coffee. On 2 occasions my key card had to be re-set : annoying when you return from a long day. The bathrooms could do with updating - still using shower curtains. </DOC> Had a one night business stay here. Impressed with the place, nice and great staff. I would however avoid the pub that is part of the hotel, very locally and loud. I opted to go for a solo dinner in the pub leaving the couples in the restaurant but wished I hadn\'t. Despite being a relatively new building inside it has a nice feel and they have attempted to give it a bit of heritage. Based on the edge of a business park you\'re not really going to go for a nice country walk but seems like a decent location to base yourself on the south coast. More couples than families I would suggest.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"Thoroughly enjoyed our two day break at The Grove. We stayed as a package and visited the Warner Brothers studio where they made the Harry Potter films. Couldn't fault anything. Everywhere was spotlessly clean, and all staff members we encountered were friendly and very efficient from the concierge to the staff in the restaurant. Lovely room, with mini bar and tea/coffee making facilities. Whole atmosphere very relaxing. I loved the beach and the potting shed, and we spent a day in the spa chilling out. Changing room was even equipped with hair straighteners! Restaurant food excellent and the fact that the locals use it and regard the place so highly speaks volumes. This is one place that I wouldn't need to be asked twice if I'd like to return to! </DOC> The decor might not be to everyone's taste and it's size might put some people off but it doesn't bother me at all. Our room was huge and well appointed, clean and very quiet. Sitting outside on the terrace with a drunk in the afternoon, watching the people come and go was a delight. If you're looking for a small, intimate country house hotel, this isn't for you but if you're not The a Grove fits the bill perfectly. </DOC> Stayed after a corporate golf day. The Hotel and Service is Fantastic the staff excellent in all departments. The course is in excellent condition and always well maintained. Food is excellent so my tip is if you haven't been yet give it a try. </DOC> Stayed here as a business treat weekend with partners. We had a spa/golf package, which was not cheap! Have to say though the whole experience was great, service, food, golf, spa etc etc. We ate in Colletts night one, very nice 8 course taster menu, then The Stable night two, which was also very good apart from the screaming kid! The golf course is amazing, couldn't fault it even after a 24 hour deluge of rain. </DOC> Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been to The Grove for a while and was pleasantly surprised by the experience. Lovely lunchtime buffet with a wide selection of foods for all tastes. And decent attentive service too. Well recommended. </DOC> Had a one night stay to break up a long drive for an early morning meeting. The setting and the grounds are very nice indeed. Check in was fast and efficient. Room was spotless and had ample space and a great bed. I left too early for breakfast but did return for lunch (Stables Restaurant), which was ok but not fantastic. The biggest (and only real) negative was the time it took the valet to collect my car in the morning - I reckon I waited around 15 minutes and I didn't really have 15 minutes to spare. It wasn't the valet's fault - he was working flat out. However, there was easily enough demand for two valets and it's a shame that this let the place down slightly. </DOC> Can't complain about this place. Which is rare for me. Staff, room, cleanliness, gym and general atmosphere all amazing. Room (had the lowest category) was still spacious, well equipped and clean. Only complaint would be that the window (overlooking the drive) could use a shade or blind so you could have some light AND privacy versus drawing the curtains fully. Room service food was excellent and on time! Would return. </DOC> We've stayed in the Grove 3 times already, the first time was in 2012. We do love this place. The hotel is perfectly located to visit the Harry Potter studio in Watford (only 5 min drive). It is in a stunning park with great walks. Children are more than welcome. And the outdoor pool is fabulous and heated (did not exist the first time we stayed there). We were slightly disappointed with the breakfast this time as it used to be amazing but we found there was less choice than before and not as good as our prior visits. We had cream tea which on the other hand was delicious. It is a fun and beautiful hotel."

SUMMARY:  b'Marvelen and his team are fantastic and the staff at the front desk were very helpful and we were given a room on the ground floor facing the beach with a view of the beach .food was not the best but the best thing is the biscuits and gravy .hotel is a little out of the way but worth a visit !</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"stayed here for fa cup semi final. hotel does show some signs of wear and tear and would benefit from some redecoration however price is excellent at weekend breakfast was excellent and service friendly and efficient only down side was that the corridors were noisy at night rooms have excellent new hd tvs. i would certainly stay here again and the railway station is handy for london </DOC> stayed here bank holiday weekend good room excellent staff three adults dbb for 134 pounds good food in evening excellent food at breakfest one of best hi breakfasts i have had highly recommended pool nice too and excellent tv </DOC> This is the third time I have stayed at this hotel, and I must say that I have never been disappointed. As has been mentioned in other reviews the breakfast buffet is excellent with a wide choice and plentiful. The staff are very helpful and efficient and friendly, which makes a very pleasant change. I am sure I will be staying here again. </DOC> Reception and bar staff is the friendliest I've come across! It's in an ideal location, food is good and there's an M&S a few steps away if you fancy something different. Rooms are probably due a refurb but you can't beat a Holiday Inn bed, regardless. This is my 'go to' chain! Prices vary wildly as they have a huge number of corporate clients but if you can get it at a good price, don't hesitate. </DOC> Often stay at this property & have always found the accommodations go be clean, tidy & well presented. As normally with colleagues we tend to dine away from the hotel so cannot comment on the restaurant. Leisure Facility is very good and I often make use of the pool. Avoid arriving/leaving around rush hour as it's a nightmare - although nothing the hotel can do about that! </DOC> Great staff well informative and efficient Really nice welcome Room was good clean and nice bathroom tiled differently but more modern than many ive stayed in Well recommended Didnt eat here so cannot comment on this </DOC> This hotel is conveniently situated just off ghe M1. The parking is good and there's a good car registration facility on a tablet based on the reception desk. There are plenty of tables and chairs for informal business discussions. </DOC> Looking at negatives first: Its an average holiday inn .. nothing more.It may be slightly tired looking in its fittings and carpets .Smaller sized rooms. Positives : -very close to motorway junction -Very polite staff - combination of the Asian check in staff, African/ Chinese/white eastern European hard working restaurant staff and cleaners. -Room Service was spot on and quick! - champagne breakfast served on x mas day. manager visited restaurant to make sure things went well. -The breakfast is well priced and Children eat free. Omlettes and haddock cooked to order included in price. -Next door has a marks and spencers food outlet and pubs close by. -Pool shut early on x mas day but was of good standard expected at Holiday inn level -large car park"

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"Nice room, comfortable bed, good breakfast, very pleasant surroundings in the Astor Wing and helpful staff. Add this to the free to roam facility within the castle and grounds and this became a very memorable visit. Just remember there are no facilities other than breakfast and tea coffee in the room. A pleasant 15 minutes walk will take you to the local pub where food is served. </DOC> Checkin was very friendly and efficient. The room was fantastic with a great view of the castle. The bathroom was large and very clean. We loved the fact that you could turn the shower on remotely and it would indicate when the water was a your desired setting. The bathroom had an electric heated towel rail but the bedroom was on the main central heating circuit which was turned off for summer. The room was a little chilly for us but an electric heater was supplied on request and we spent 2 wonderful nights at the castle sleeping in a very comfortable bed. The WiFi was excellent. There was plenty to see and do during the day and at around 6pm every day we had the castle grounds to ourselves. The included breakfast was first rate served in incredible rooms. There was a good pub for evening dinner just in front of the main entrance. We loved our time at Hever Castle. </DOC> We visited the weekend before Christmas when there was a winter Farye. The castle looked beautiful lit up night and together with the Christmas lights made a spectacular scene. We stayed in the cheapest room class but we still got a four poster bed which was really comfortable. The bathroom was a good size too. We stayed in the Astor wing which had a lounge and snooker room which we had all to our size. We came by train which was a good 20 minute walk to the castle which wasn't a problem but you need to be careful as there are no pavements. It could also be useful to have a torch for night. On its own this would be quite an expensive break however access to the castle and grounds is included on both days of your stay which makes it more reasonable and the grounds are truly wonderful. </DOC> We really liked our room and the comfortable bed. The room though was quite dusty and there was only 1 small shower gel for 2 of us. Breakfast wasn't as good as we expected - there were very few seasonal strawberries, raspberries or cherries and I ordered a full English and it arrived without an egg - they did bring me another breakfast which was nice but it seemed to us that they were not cooked to order as listed but kept warm and assembled to order. My wife's omelette had shell in it and was undercooked - it didn't have any colour at all. That said - what a lovely place </DOC> Just stayed here to attend a wedding, fantastic location and we had the whole place to our group so it felt very special. The staff are fantastic and so welcoming and the rooms are lovely, spacious and bright with comfortable beds. The breakfast the following morning was high quality and tasty. The only (slight) negative was the check in/out times, the rooms are very expensive and the experience felt rushed, we\xe2\x80\x99d have liked more time to chill and use the room, we also asked for a socket extension for our room which never materialised but small moans really in what was a fantastic stay. </DOC> It is certain a unique experience to stay on the grounds of the castle- not only for historic reasons, but because as a guest you have 24 hr access to the beautiful gardens. I loved this aspect, as for most of my walks, I was the only person in sight! The Hotel even offers wellies to use should it be muddy. The room was nicely appointed and very comfortable. The morning breakfast was plentiful and delicious. I highly recommend staying here. </DOC> Stayed for 1 night celebrating my mum's birthday with some family, it was incredible. Rooms - Stunning, clean, comfortable. Billiard room to keep entertained and a lounge with fire. Staff - Friendly and helpful. Breakfast - Good selection that they cook to order. Pastries, cereals, and drinks you help yourself to. Castle and grounds are amazing and open to guests to look around when closed to public. The free tour of inside the castle we had in the morning was very good. For dinner go to Henry 8th pub just outside the grounds. Only regret is that we could only stay 1 night as had flight next day. Highly recommend this place. </DOC> What a lovely place and such good value for money. We stayed in the Tulip room which was huge. We managed to take a peek into some of the other rooms, all looked lovely but if you can book the Tulip room you won't be disappointed. The fact that you get complimentary tickets to Hever Castle is a big bonus as you are able to enter early in the morning and stay later in the evening after everyone else has left. My only grumbles were the fact that there were no robes or slippers and we were not sure how to alter the heating, so we slept with the windows open. Breakfast was good. Our stay was a silver wedding gift from my mother in law and I cant thank her enough - wonder if she'll pay for our 26th anniversary?"

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"Upon arrival it\xe2\x80\x99s not a great sight. An oblong grey concrete box, looks possibly like an old office building. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t filled with much hope. Had a room up on the top floor overlooking the golf course. Was a lovely view. Room well equipped and was quiet. Walls were solid in the rooms and so was the floor so there was very little intrusion from other guests. Over the few nights I was there I really enjoyed my room. Breakfast was reasonable food and brought to you rather than the common buffet style which was lovely. Staff friendly too. The only downside was there was little or no atmosphere and just felt bit of an \xe2\x80\x98odd\xe2\x80\x99 place. Would stay again tho! </DOC> Stayed here for two nights in a superior room. The bedroom was fine but the bathroom needed some attention. Had a good night on the first night, but the second night was disturbed by a wedding party with quite loud ?music? until 23.30. Breakfast the first morning was a fiasco with people queuing for a table. The second morning it was better as it was served in a larger area with more tables. The food was good both at breakfast and at the two dinners we had. </DOC> We love this place so introduced our friends to it, as they were from the area and wanted to visit. It took some persuading to get him here as he recalled the place in the past and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look much outside. We arrived at about 2.30 pm and he was closed convinced before he\xe2\x80\x99d seen the rooms as the receptionist was so friendly and welcoming. The rooms were spotlessly clean and comfortable. The lounge comfortable and the bar very reasonably priced. The staff in this hotel make it an excellent place to stay, they are all polite and friendly and nothing is too much trouble, we will be back again soon we hope. </DOC> Stayed here in March and have to say the room was nice and large. The staff on reception were happy to help with any questions and requests. I was staying for a social occasion in the evening but I have to say the food was a letdown for me. I expected better. Maybe it was the fact it was catering for a large group. Would be willing to give the benefit of the doubt and would stay again. </DOC> Booked a table for 8 people for an evening meal. The restaurant only had about 10 tables, which for such a large hotel, surprised me. The food was excellent. The service was very good indeed. The price was right. Alas the bar was in the same area, and a party of about 40 people descended on the bar. They were eating in a function room. Whilst they were at the bar all conversation at our table had to cease as we could not hear anything that was said. It was not for that, I would have given this a five discs, but other diners need to be aware. It is a very poor design. </DOC> I've learnt not to judge a book by it's cover, though when I pulled up to this brutalist monstrosity I was fearing the worst. However, the receptionist couldn't have been more helpful, and upon check in I found the room to be immaculate, with balcony overlooking the golf course and a superb comfortable bed. The breakfast was outstanding, so if you're ever in Grimsby this is the only place you should stay. </DOC> It might come as a surprise, but I consistently find this hotel the best in the area. Modern and clean, the rooms and bathrooms and public areas are great. Reception staff are helpful but the rest of the waiting staff NEED a lot more training. Service at breakfast is frankly awful as are some of the staffs appearance. They need to be tidy and fresh and at least look interested in their job! This time attended a private event in their ballroom and the food was shocking and again useless service. Overall good accommodation but service lets them down, especially for \xc2\xa3118 per room. </DOC> the hotel has recently been modernised and the decor and ambiance is positive and pleasing. room on the top floor overlooked the golf course and was spacious and generous in size and quality restaurant for dinner had a great choice and freshly prepared and served - breakfast was great with good cold and hot selections again all waitress served"

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'Nice pub, that takes dogs. Popped in for lunch and found Good simple food. Tasty sandwiches and fajitas and also very good beer. Nice place for a simple lunch. Friendly staff made us very welcome and very central. Would certainly go back again </DOC> Two nights here. No lift and a lot of stairs up to rooms 12 and 14. Nice \'bistro\' location for evening meals and breakfast. Bar dining also available. Restricted car parking. Staff are helpful but definitely Yorkshire - ish, make up your own mind. Really good location for walking into Richmond. No loud music so popular with the more discerning locals. Could do with some upgrading. </DOC> family dinner for 6 after seeing the panto next door before we drove back down the A1 varied menu. Portions sizes great. The largest fish I have ever seen or had when getting fish and chips so large I couldnt eat it which is unheard of. Every one seemed to enjoy all their meals which included curry, chicken roast and beef roast. </DOC> Was taken here to celebrate my wife\'s birthday with family. Small restuarant but attentive, quick service and good food. Small - so if you\'re with children in buggys/strollers be aware you might need to fold them up. Quick service. Main courses around the \xc2\xa310 mark. An amount of food between plentiful and sparse. Enjoyable. Smiled at the seat in the window that has a small plaque that says "please vacate for musicians" </DOC> Arrived in Richmond hungry and happened upon the Black Lion. All three of us ordered fish and chips and were very impressed with the quality of everything in the plate. The local beers were delicious and staff professional, friendly and helpful. Would go back in a flash. </DOC> Location, location, location.....this Inn, has to be a gem in Richmond. Parking is a nightmare so having their own car park is brilliant. Staff really helpful and friendly. Loved our room even though bathroom was across corridor....not a problem, it was private and dressing gowns provided if needed. Very warm and comforting throughout. Dog friendly (able to eat in bar area and snug area for breakfast) Richmond in general is a lovely, friendly town. Well worth a visit </DOC> Our own hotel didn\'t look very welcoming for dinner so we walked a short distance and came to the Black Lion. Very clean and welcoming. We were early so were offered the early bird menu. Excellent selection and the food was very good. Add in the very friendly service and our evening was well and truly saved.. </DOC> Asked a local for a recommendation for Sunday Lunch. Inside it is traditionally decorated. Because we were there at 12pm, we were able to get a table, although many who arrived later had pre booked. Sunday lunch was tasty, hot and the puddings were great too. Would recommend it.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"The hotel is conveniently located for road access with a big car park. My room was clean and had plenty of space, with a comfortable bed and extremely (too?) powerful shower. The building could do with some work to bring it up to date and feels rather old fashioned. We were awoken by the fire alarm fairly early in the morning - perhaps someone showering with the bathroom door open? Breakfast was very average and the coffee tasteless. </DOC> This hotel just needs a bit of investment. Tired rooms, scruffy carpets and grubby paintwork spoil what could be a pleasant and useful business venue. Restaurant limited but good breakfast and bar serves some good wine. Staff work hard and are helpful and pleasant, they deserve some investment. </DOC> The staff were very friendly and the rooms were of adequate quality, the beds are comfy and the shower was good, all in all a god place to stay to conduct business in the nearby areas. Tea and coffee making facilities in the room with biscuits and free wifi was a bonus. </DOC> This was our 3rd stay at the Four Pillars & it was excellent yet again, the price we paid was very reasonable and the food during the weekend was really good & when we checked in we were given 2 25% off vouchers for the restaurant. The staff are very attentive & very obliging, there is plenty of car parking spaces and the grounds are nicely kept. We had an event in the conservatory on the Sat nice & the food was again excellent. </DOC> Stayed for one night and found the rooms to be clean and tidy with a comfortable bed.. Reception staff very friendly and helpful providing a quick check in and out. Disappointed with the food offer as I ordered from the bar menu only to be told that they stopped taking orders 15 minutes ago from the bar menu and I would have to order from the restaurant menu which had a limited selection. </DOC> Popped in here today for a working lunch with a business partner, service was prompt, price was reasonable and quality was good. I had a chicken fillet burger with salad and fries - it was very good. Didnt stay over so cant comment on bedrooms </DOC> Hotel is only 3 star but the staff at this hotel are certainly 5 star - so welcoming, so friendly and nothing too much trouble. Immediately made welcome from the moment I checked in. When I couldn't make the heating work properly someone appeared as soon as I put the phone down. Room was clean and adequate though could do with some redecoration. Meals good value for money and a well cooked english breakfast. Great for travelling en route to Oxford and surrounding areas on overnight stay. </DOC> My last visit to this location was a good one. It has improved. The rooms remain as they were, which is good. Breakfast was fine. The big difference was that we had dinner there this time. The dinner menu was very good, indeed, better than expected. It remains a good option for an en route stop over for families and is ideally located for business travellers. Prices were reasonable too with free wi fi in all rooms and plentiful parking. There is even a fuel station next door !! Recommended ? Yes."

Parking is a lottery with no organisation . bit far out from gatwick need a taxi. This is a britannia group hotel say no more.!!! </DOC> A really nice looking building from the outside. Inside there is quite a lot of work needs doing on the maintenance side. We stayed with National Holidays in a 4 bed room which had torn lace curtains, very dim lighting and little wardrobe space. Having said that it was clean and tidy. The hotel boasts acres of grounds to explore but what they dont tell you is most of the grounds are full of airport parked cars. The restaurant is on the small size and the buffet food was only ok in the evening. Breakfast again was everything you would expect but only lukewarm. The evening buffet was priced at \xc2\xa312.50 and the breakfast at \xc2\xa39.50. Were they worth the money..........no!

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"Wilderness Village is right across the road to the Cradle Mountain information center. Nice cabin. We booked the studio and ended up with a larger cabin with kitchen (fridge/microwave), living room with TV, bathroom with heat lamps, 2 bedrooms (one with queen and one with 2 sets of bunkbeds), electric blankets on the bed and all rooms with heating. Private back deck surrounded by trees. Guest lounge with view of Cradle Mountain and the bush as well as fire place and stocked bar (honour system), board games, book exchange, cd lending library and tourism info. There is also a DVD lending library at the front desk (closes at 6pm). We didn't ask about wifi or try to go online so I'm not sure if available. Cabins seemed to go on a sale online the night before if vacancy. </DOC> Very comfortable and spacious room with a well equiped kitchenette. Lovely and quiet and although we didn't use the spa, it would be lovely to sit and look out at the bush. Even though we visited in January, it was quite cold and we loved the fireplace. None of the rooms have a view of Cradle Mountain but apparently none of the hotels do anyway. </DOC> Had 2 nights in cabin11 in April. Was comfortable and worked well for us as a couple. Great setting and had everything needed for self catering. Acceptable value at $180 a night but would not want to pay more. Cradle mountain area itself fantastic </DOC> Next time you visit Cradle Mountain, stay at the Wilderness Village. I've stayed here every time we go to Cradle Mountain. All accommodation is cabin style - we had the spa one. You have a wonderful view of the bush. Breakfast is continental (you pick it up at dinner at Hellyers restaurant at the hotel) and is delicious. The cabin is so charming. The kitchen is large and there is a gas fireplace, although it took a bit of working out how to get it working! The bedroom is large, as is the en suite. </DOC> Stayed in a 2 Bedroom Villa which had 1 queen bed in one room, and 2 sets of bunks in another. Room was clean and functional, great for families with young kids, will need some updating soon. </DOC> Good location, very near to the visitor centre and entrance to the reserves. Simple and dated rooms, it's clean though, won't complain if it didn't cost so much... Kitchenette has 2 stoves, microwave and a small fridge, simple cooking is possible. Better to visit a Supermarket before head up there, very limited choices once you are in the mountains... </DOC> Fair-sized cabin in isolated, natural environment. Bedrooms just about big enough, especially if a a lot of luggage to cope with as well. Could do with a lot more coat-hooks to hang things up. Toilet is in the bathroom, so may need to plan bathroom usage especially if one or more in the party spend a lot of time in the bathroom! </DOC> We stayed overnight in a very spacious cabin which was more like a small house.It was clean & warm which is what we required.Its a short walk to the visitors centre & we found service & food at the restaurant to be excellent. We were very happy & would recommend this place."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"Tried to check in (noon) early (silver elite) request and no clean rooms available. Came back later and checked in. Went down for breakfast and couldn't get anything since it was a long waiting line. Not enough help in breakfast area. No coffee was available twice. No waffle mix. Really kind of a bad set up design for the breakfast. Never was thanked or greeted like a normal Marriott. Coffee in room was old. No manager could be found just front desk agent. Needed more help in lobby on weekend. Requested extra pillows & towels and the pillows & bed didn't seem like good quality. </DOC> This hotel looks like a Fairfield Inn concerted to a SpringHill Suites. Staff was friendly and rooms were OK. It is back from the beaten path behind the Towne Suites. The TV lineup is very limited and the internet nothing to write home about. AVERAGE. </DOC> Mattress had blood spots on it upon inspection. Dirty socks in closet. Turned around and checked out immediately. Was appalled at the condition of the room. I am a Marriott platinum member. Better options with Marriott elsewhere in the area. </DOC> Despite complaints from other reviewers, our room on the 4th floor was clean, free of mold, reasonably updated, and had nothing else objectionable. I've stayed in much better and much worse Marriott Hotels. I'd put this one right at average, and above other brands in the same price range. The indoor pool was an added benefit in the winter. Parking is plentiful. Restaurants and shopping are within 1 half mile. Access to the interstate is a little far - about a mile on busy roads. </DOC> We booked this hotel As most Springhill suites are very nice. This one was more of your run-of-the-mill. The hotel did meet all our criteria. It\xe2\x80\x99s just it\xe2\x80\x99s not as nice as I\xe2\x80\x99m used to from Springhill in a pinch I would stay here again. The property is hard to find as it\xe2\x80\x99s tucked back in trees and the sign is covered by trees. If you need to quiet this might not be the place as the interstate roars by. </DOC> Booked this hotel at last minute. Have stayed at a SpringHill Suites in downtown Indy before and had a great experience. There wasn't anything horribly wrong with the hotel, but it definitely wasn't up to the standards of the one in downtown Indy. The room had a slight smell to it and we had difficulty sleeping with the sound of traffic all night. It seemed a little muggy, too. Come to find out, the window had been slightly cracked all night. The bed wasn't horrible, but I have slept in better. Breakfast did have lots of options. Overall, just an average hotel. </DOC> Nice space. Plenty of room to work. Large bathroom and nice sitting area. Smaller TV and the Internet did not work during peak hours, but that is pretty commonplace in hotels these days. My room was even numbered and on the end which made the highway noise very noticeable. Thermostat was nifty but I was never sure what temperature I had set it at... Friendly staff and nice breakfast. </DOC> I have stayed at Sprinhill Suites before so knew what to expect room wise. I like having a separate sitting area and a fridge and microwave. When I checked in the staff recommended some restuarants that deliver as I wanted to order in. Monday morning I dropped a diamond earring down my bathroom sink drain so I was very releived that they hotel sent someone to retrieve it for me promptly. They were kind enough to call my cell and give me the good news. There are a lot of restaurants, mostly chains, and a Whole Foods within a short drive. A good spot for a business traveller as the desk is a decent size and the wireless is reliable"

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"Front desk staff is helpful, Hotel is clean and quiet. All the usual things you would expect at a Courtyard. I stay here quite often for work. Some of the rooms could use a little freshening up for things like peeling wallpaper and cracked sinks in the bathrooms. Good option for the price. </DOC> Due to work I've traveled frequently to Cleveland and the Courtyard Marriott has become my home away from home. It's what you'd expect from a Courtyard, big rooms, comfortable beds and extreme cleanliness. They've recently renovated and now that the new carpet smell has gone away, it's even nicer. In addition they have a good-sized pool and a newly re-modeled workout room. The best part is the staff. They are always friendly and helpful. I'll be eternally grateful to them for helping me last spring when during a cold spell my car wouldn't start. Maintenance was called and within minutes met me to jump start my car. I was impressed by how quickly they took care of me. That's how their service always is, efficient AND with a smile. </DOC> My husband stayed here for one night to the Rock Roll Museum in the area. The rooms were clean, and parking for the motorcycles was good. The hotel was located near the airport, but it was quite and safe area. We would recommend if passing through Cleveland. </DOC> I think this is probably the best Courtyard I have ever stayed at. The rooms are updated and very trendy looking. Also, they are very clean. The staff is wonderful. The front counter staff is SO friendly and would do anything you asked of them. The shuttle will take you to restaurants within 5 miles of the hotel which is a nice perk. Although, the location is really good with a short walk to many good restaurants. Normally, I'm not a fan of Courtyards because they don't offer free breakfast, even for Platinum members, but I can overlook that with this hotel. </DOC> You have certain expectations of Marriott branded hotels; Courtyards were there to please business travelers and keep costs down. The new Courtyards are far beyond that and the redo of this location tells the story. The Rooms: all redone within the last 6 months; the hallways to the room and the rooms were of a much higher quality and standards than you would expect from a Courtyard - really nice, up to date and comfy. The Lobby- simple, neat, great seating area and food to order with a bar! Nice touches. We have stayed in many updated Courtyards by Marriott and this is one of the nicest. Lots of hotels by many brands in this area but I would highly recommend you try this one. By the way, staff was very nice and accommodating! </DOC> Recently stayed here before vacation in order to use park and fly Front desk staff are great Indoor pool was clean Rooms clean and well appointed Convenient airport shuttle Easy access from highways Only 5 minutes to airport Rooms were stopped coffee makers There were plenty of parking spots </DOC> The hotel is modern with all the necessary amenities. Staff is courteous and helpful. Lobby area is comfortable, clean with television and local information for things to do, weather, traffic, etc. Rooms were also clean and most had a balcony. Hotel is close to Interstate Highways to get you quickly to Cleveland's entertainment and close to Hopkins airport </DOC> Stayed here one night after a long day of travel. Staff was very nice and room was perfect. I slept sound.Made it in time to grab a cold beer and relax in my room to wind down. Would stay here again when in Cleveland."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"The other reviews are dead on, the staff and the hotel is great. During my 4 night stay I only had one problem with my frig in the room and they had it replaced in 30 minutes. I have never seen a cleaner pool or hot tub, ever! The maid service is top notch and everyone is super friendly and helpful. With over 90 Marriott stays this year, this is rated in the top 5. </DOC> This is your typical Courtyard. The property is in good shape. The common areas are well kept and clean. The rooms are clean and comfortable and very low noise. The water pressure in the shower left a lot to be desired. The fitness center and pool are very nice and all the equipment seems to be in great shape. </DOC> We were impressed by the Courtyard by Marriot where we stayed for a night while visiting the Football Hall of Fame (which is five minutes away). The room was comfortable, nicely furnished, clean and spacious. It seemed particularly well set-up for business travelers (good workstation and free internet). The staff was very friendly and helpful. The indoor pool looked great for families with younger kids, and the fitness center was nicely outfitted. </DOC> The rooms were more than adequate and clean and well appointed. The staff was awesome. They were so friendly and very attentive to your needs. The location is close to lots of restaurants and shopping, including the Football Hall of Fame. Only had breakfast and found plenty of choices. </DOC> located just off of I-77, is a very solid Courtyard. Well kept, efficient and very friendly staff. rooms are neat, comfortable and well-maintained. front desk staff was super. i would stay here again. if road noise bothers you request a room that does not face the highway. was not significant but there is a bit of low-level noise at high traffic times </DOC> I did an event for work, a banquet for about 20 with half of the folks spending the night. It went very well. I was on a budget, but the food was very good and very well presented. Making the arrangements was easy and the staff was great to work with. Location can be tricky to find (it's like a Cracker Barrel, easy to see from the highway but difficult to get to). </DOC> The brand lived up to my expectation from having stayed at other Courtyards. The room was spacious and clean with the standard amenities. Personally I thought the rate to be a tad high but with the help of an AAA discount, it was very reasonable. In the lobby there actually was a large bar area with several televisions. This was an unexpected touch from other Courtyards I have stayed in. The location itself, is ideal. Directly off of the highway and in the middle of many restaraunts and shopping (Belden Village Mall is directly across the street). While a little awkward, finding the location is not a major exercise. Just know that once you exit the highway, it is immediately nearby. You will enter a drive for other business and the property is set way in the back. Service was perfect and I woud certainly stay again. </DOC> We stayed two other times at this Courtyard, and our latest visit did not disappoint. The location is near the freeway and convenient to all of the places we needed to visit in Canton and Massillon. Our rooms were comfortable and quiet (we faced away from the freeway). My husband noted that the elevator seemed small for such a big hotel, but otherwise, we had no complaints. The price was reasonable for the quality of the hotel."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'I stayed here in August for a classmate reunion nearby. The hotel is located in about 20 miles from Cleveland downtown, in a very nice and quiet town called Solon. It\'s also near Chagrin Falls. The hotel is new, neat, well designed and standard for a suite-hotel. The breakfast was good too. They have bacon made from beef. It was a new experience for me. I\'d expect the price a little bit lower than what I paid. But overall, I like my stay. </DOC> What a great hotel, conveniently located near the National Park and Ski areas. The staff was super friendly. The hotel provided large clean rooms. The pool area was clean. The morning breakfast was good. Stayed during a winter storm and appreciated how they provided window scrappers and brushes to borrow. Loved the area and hotel and will stay here again. </DOC> Very impressed with this Springhill Suites. Very friendly a efficient front desk staffClean, nice room, the pool was great for the kids. It was warm and clean. The hot tub was also great. We just checked in today, so we\'ll check out the breakfast in the morning, but if it follows suit it should be great. </DOC> Frankly, I couldn\'t wait to get back home and pen a review of this excellent hotel. From start to finish our three days at the SpringHill Suits in Solon, OH, was an absolute pleasure. Every aspect of this hotel -- staff, recently remodeled structure, breakfast, evening snack, beautiful suite, crystal-clear 42" LG, pool, workout room, location -- I would grade at a "10". To cap it all off they offer rooms at a very competitive rate. I could go on with more details but if I started then paragraphs would follow. If you need a hotel in the Cleveland area that is superbly run, strategically located near major travel arteries, in a safe and pleasant locale, and all at a good price, then look no further. Thanks for making our stay unexpectedly wonderful. Keep up the good work. </DOC> As I write this I am sitting by the pool of this wonderful hotel. The check in staff were very friendly and helpful in giving us ideas for things to do. Housekeeping staff very friendly as well. This hotel is very clean and has spacious rooms. They served appetizers in the evenings that were delicious, and breakfast was very good as well. Lots of space in the dining area. Beds were comfortable, air conditioning worked well. My only negative was the hot tub jets were broken during our stay. Our kids really enjoyed the pool too. I tend to be picky about hotels and rarely give 5 stars-but this hotel really deserved it. As my husband put it-these people rock! Would definitely stay again. </DOC> Was in town visiting family and this was the closet hotel to where we needed to be. Lobby was clean, staff was friendly and breakfast is free & plentiful. Room was okay, but apparently it was prom weekend. Just a tad bit loud late into the evening and the lobby became very crowded. Staff really did not do much to keep it under control throughout the hotel. Probably would stay again due to convenience...just need to make sure there are no events being held. </DOC> Pros: very friendly staff typical springhill suites rooms amazing gym good network connectivity typical springhill suites breakfast selection Cons: higher end of cost per night of other springhill suites in the midwest area </DOC> We stayed here just one night (wish it had been more!) and really enjoyed this hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and the hotel itself is beautifully decorated and in great condition/very clean! Breakfast offered several options, from eggs/sausage to cereal/toast, plus the evening reception with beer/wine was a nice touch. Beds were comfortable, and room was large - four of us stayed comfortably in a room with 2 queen beds plus sofabed. Location made it easy to get to Cleveland to visit the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. If we\'re back in the area in the future, we\'ll definitely return - highly recommend this hotel!'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"This Hampton Inn offers nearly all of what you expect at a Hampton, but at a GREAT price. The staff was very welcoming. The only amenities missing were the whirlpool, and in room bathtubs. Of course, there was an indoor pool, and fine working showers in the rooms. While prices may vary with the seasons and events, at least in March, this Hampton Inn was half the price of most, making it a truly great value. It is also located in a fascinating town that has preserved much of its history. </DOC> My only complaint is the 1st room we walked in and it was not made up at all and looked like a disaster (but we did stay Jan 1st, 2012 and were told it was sold out for New Year's and not all the rooms were cleaned). 2nd room was made up but fridge was broken so the 3rd was the charm. That fiasco cost us 30 minutes of running around when we just wanted to get something to eat and sleep for the night to get home but it all worked out in the end and was very quiet and nice clean comfy room. </DOC> This is a pretty solid Hampton Inn and a Category 2! The room was clean, the staff was helpful with dinner recommendations, and the hotel was conveniently located to the Interstate. The wifi was a bit intermittent. Would certainly stay here again. </DOC> My son and I stayed here while on a mini road trip. I expect only three things from a hotel like this: hot shower, clean and quiet. We were put on the first floor right next to the breakfast area. I expected it to be loud in the morning, but we are early risers so that was acceptable. Unfortunately, it was loud the entire night. Banging us and banging on both sides. Ugh. We were given a our welcome goodies and we are Hilton HHonors. Overall, it was a poor experience. After realizing that we left my son's favorite stuffed animal. I called the very next morning.. Although polite on the phone, no one got back to me nor could anyone find anything. I will never stay here, again. And I will do my best to avoid Hilton's altogether. There are too many choices out there with positive experiences. </DOC> Stopped here for one night on our way to California. Hotel is located near the highway so it was easy on and off. Check in was quick and staff friendly. Rooms were nice, beds were comfy. Bathroom was large but could use a little updating. Fitness room was small (1 elliptical, 2 treadmills, free weights and bench). Breakfast area was nice and staff was very friendly .. food was pretty standard. We did not explore the area but seemed nearby casinos were abundant. We were pulling a fifth wheel and did not want to unhook to go find food. Unfortunately, we found there was nothing nearby within walking distance and no Ubers, cabs or even casino shuttles. Another night of snacks! \xf0\x9f\x98\x9d </DOC> I've stayed in almost every hotel in the Miami/Grove/Vinita area, and the Miami Hampton is easily the best of the bunch. It's a Hampton Inn, so it's not exactly luxurious. But the staff is efficient and genuinely friendly; the rooms are comfortably equipped with good tv, good internet, nice work area, and adequate lighting; the cleanliness is above average; the beds are good. I'd like better towels, a larger tv, a nearby restaurant, and a more hygenic breakfast plan, but I'm pretty picky. </DOC> Easy to get to off I 44. The Inn has has had a lot of remodeling and is very nice. The staff is friendly and the price is right. the breakfast is typical Hampton Inn and well stocked. We would stay there again. </DOC> We based our stay here on the Hampton reputation for cleanliness and quality and were not disappointed. A great rate didn't hurt either! :) We usually stay in Springfield, MO on our trips to Arizona, but switched to Miami,OK because the hotels were so much cheaper. We will use this hotel from now on-very clean, quiet and comfortable. I can't say that Miami, OK is some traveler's dream destination, but we were happy with the switch."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'I needed a good hotel after a long drive from Amarillo and this fit the bill. Being close to I-40 it is a bit noisy though. The noisiest thing in room 428 was the toilet. When I flushed it it kept on refilling: the valve didn\xe2\x80\x99t seat correctly. Fortunately I own several homes and I know how to fix this, so I did. Saves water. The bed was really comfortable, I slept very well. Room was nice, the girl who checked me in recognized my status and I\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to stay here again. </DOC> If you are traveling to the FAA\'s Academy in OKC, this is a wonderful option. New, clean, convenient, free breakfast, great I-40 location. The service is top notch. No bike in the exercise room or they get a perfect score from me. </DOC> I stayed here with my wife using Marriott Rewards points prior to catching an early flight out of OKC. This is a typical Springhill Suites property - relatively new, very clean, and very comfortable. The location is great - very convenient to the airport and the west side of Oklahoma City. The hotel is comfortable and you will get what you pay for! There was some renovation taking place in the common area where breakfast is served but it isn\'t inconvenient. Recommended. </DOC> Stayed at theSpringHill Suites Oklahoma City Airport for four nights on business recently and loved the hotel. Check in was a breeze, the room was very large with a separate living room area with a couch, microwave and mini fridge. There was a daily breakfast buffet and a nightly small dinner buffet that I usually skipped, but at dinner they did offer complimentary beer and wine. The indoor pool/hottub area was nice if a little small. There was also a small excerise room. It is convienent to the FAA academy and they did have the Government per diem rate available. About the only thing that would have made it better was if the hotel was located in Bricktown so I wouldn\'t have had to drive 10 minutes to get there. </DOC> This hotel was probably the cleanest hotel I have ever stayed at!! Housekeeping was excellent and all the front desk clerks were very nice and helpful. I forgot my laptop when I checked out on a sunday so first thing monday morning they overnighted it to me and I received it at my house tuesday morning. Very prompt service. This will most defiantly be my regular hotel choice when I am in Oklahoma City from now on. </DOC> I stay in OKC area 4 times a year. I recently stayed here on a \'rewards\' certificate and was quite pleased. It was a clean and well kept hotel. Keep in mind, you\'re paying for a discount hotel, and not a full blown Marriott, so the amenities/quality are going to be at that level. I would definitely consider this hotel the next time I pass through town. The only negatives about this hotel - The furniture is a little worn inside the rooms, and showing some of its age. Location - I\'ve read many reviews about the location of this hotel - I will say it is in a horrible part of town, like all airport hotels. If you\'re looking for a nice area, Bricktown is where you want to be. But again, I didn\'t ding the hotel for this </DOC> Springhill Suites are usually very good. This one excels. Besides being brand new, super clean, and modern decor, the staff know the definition of customer service. In addition, it is one of the only Springhills that offers an evening light dinner with free wine/beer, and the breakfast is above the Springhill average. The only minor quibbles are it took a long time to get the shuttle at the airport on arrival and the location is not ideal- although very safe, it is right behind a Jack in the Box/Panda Express and next to a Ryder Truck Rental place - across a strip mall with Wal-mart. Although convenient shopping, the surrounding atmosphere is "parking lot". These flaws are, however, minor and are far surpassed by what goes on inside. Keep up the good work! </DOC> This hotel is just off the I40 in west Oklahoma City and near the airport but there was no airport noise. It is an old style Springhill Suites with a dividing wall between the sitting area and the sleeping area. Good breakfast and very nice, clean rooms. Staff is helpful. A good choice for a stop on a driving trip along I40'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'We recently stayed here to attend a family funeral. I choose this hotel as it appeared to be the best option for a full service hotel near where the family lived, and I tend to gravitate to Marriott brand hotels. We chose a room on the concierge level, as these rooms are often nicer, and your have the services of the concierge lounge. The room was mostly comfortable, but I found the bathroom to be unusually small for this level of hotel. The d\xc3\xa9cor was a bit dated, and the concierge lounge offerings for breakfast and afternoon/evening snacks and drinks were the skimpiest I have experienced at any full Marriott hotel. </DOC> i stayed here for an overnight business trip. I had recently been upgraded to Gold Elite status with Marriott rewards, so I was upgraded on my room and given concerige service. The hotel was very nice and clean. Parking is on the side of the hotel. It was busy that night, so the elevators were crowded and a bit slow. The room was comfortable and clean. Nice place and I\'m sure I will stay again. </DOC> A great hotel, has nice restaurants and bars. Very good service as well </DOC> This hotel was a very good example of a basic quality. Especially the cleanness of the rooms and hotel facilities. The location is perfect for me and the hotel location is also pretty close to several restaurants. Personnel is very helpful and dedicated. The breakfast was great (Jeanette is very sweet.) A great hotel for a business traveler. </DOC> Everything about this hotel is first class. The parking is more than ample, the lobby is elegant and inviting, the front desk staff is friendly, and there are several dining options if you don\'t want to leave the hotel. The rooms are spacious, with a comfortable bed, a large bathroom, a 37-inch HDTV with pay-per-view movies and many channels, and a refrigerator with temperature controls, which will chill your beverages rather quickly. Some will say it\'s a little too far from downtown and many of the city\'s attractions, and they may be right, but if you want to stay in a luxury setting and be treated like a king, there\'s no better place than the Southern Hills Marriott. Give it a try. You won\'t be disappointed. </DOC> I stayed here for two nights. There is plenty of free, close parking and the room was clean and comfortable, but looking a little dated. There were signs in the lobby that they are in the beginning stages of a remodel. I had dinner and breakfast, both meals were good. The breakfast was included with my rate, it was very good, the staff was a little unenthusiastic. The dinner was very good and my server was very good. My only issue is I dried my hands on a towel in the bathroom on day one and left a makeup stain. The next day, the cleaning lady, left the dirty towel hanging there and even applied the folded fanned out wash cloth to the top of it. Seemed odd to "fancy" up a clearly dirty towel, but it was my dirty hands, I guess. </DOC> Great hotel in a good location. Every single staffer I ran into was amazing. Lobby area is newly redone. Rooms are showing age but beds were comfortable and the entire place was very quiet. Note there is no longer a hot tub in the pool area. Gym facilities are nice. Will stay again. </DOC> This hotel is always reasonably priced. Since it\'s full service I stay although it\'s not close to food, etc. Only complaints - no USA Today (just WSJ and local paper), the tvs in the gym don\'t work, and location. Room is clean, nice - standard Marriott. Concierge lounge is very nice as well.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"We stayed on the road side of this hotel. I never heard a car speed by!! I was amazed at how well insulated the window and wall was. I enjoyed the King suite, or Studio suite. I liked the feel of the room and the service was fantastic! </DOC> It's a nice place to stay. Place looks pretty new and rooms and hotel is clean. There is sufficient lighting in the room and a great desk set-up to work. Wireless is pretty good as I was able to do al my work using the hotel internet. Rooms have a kitchen as well. The offered food items in the pantry to heat-up in your room is limited. Also breakfast could be better and certainly be more variety as for the 3 days I was in the hotel the hot breakfast selections were exactly the same. To get to the gym you need to walk outside which is weird and little annoying when you need to walk in the cold to return to your room. </DOC> Well kept clean \xe2\x80\x9cvintage\xe2\x80\x9d Townplace Suites Marriott property in a quiet part of Bend OR. Easy walking distance to local restaurants (not downtown). Typical Townplace free breakfast starts at 6:30am weekdays. Friendly folks delivering friendly service at reasonable prices. </DOC> My wife and I used our points for a great 3 day weekend, super location and the staff was very helpful as this was our first time to Bend and were looking at properties. They are building a new OSU campus right next door, there is already some bad traffic as folks going to Mt Bachelor will only get much worse. </DOC> We stayed here just one night on a road trip between Oregon and Colorado. We have stayed at most of the different Marriott properties in the past but this was the first time at a TownePlace Suites. This would be perfect for an extended stay with the large rooms and kitchenette facilities. They are pet friendly and this was one of the reasons that we stayed here. There is breakfast available in the morning and a nice pool. There are at least two nice brewerys located nearby, Deshutes and Cascade. Very impressed with the property and the spacious rooms! The front desk staff were helpful and really nice. </DOC> On a bluff above the Deschutes River. Near the Old Mill. Pros: Clean, high quality rooms. Fair price. Negatives: tv and phone didn't work. Desk clerk said he'd put in a work order and it would be repaired the next day, but we were checking out. </DOC> This was our second experience staying at a TownPlace Suite. We chose this one because of its close proximity to our family. I can see how the concept that TownPlace employs would be attractive to certain travelers who appreciate staying at what essentially is a studio apartment with refrigerator, range, sink, dishwasher etc. For us, the concept is not that appealing. This location does have a very nice breakfast and eating area at the entrance and the staff supporting the breakfast process is very attentive and responsive. This location is also exceptionally welcoming to travelers with dogs. Not being dog people, I would say this is somewhat of a negative for us. </DOC> Typical Townplace Suites. Room was spacious, location was good although a bit from the downtown area. Room was nice and clean, no leftover cooking or fridge smells. Could use more selection at the on site shop and at breakfast. Cooling/heating unit was loud."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"Ended up here by chance while traveling thru. A most unusual location, almost on the water, but with a major highway on both sides. We were in an upper floor room, accessed thru a passage-way and inside corridor. The room itself was clean, but looked tired. Bed was comfortable. Pool and spa were across the parking lot in a different wing of the hotel, and although we didn't use them, the facilities appeared to be clean. Breakfast was quite a bit better than some other Best Westerns, with adaquet food and choices, and constantly being refilled. Front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. </DOC> Had some points to use for this stay, did think that the pictues of the hotel look slightly better than it actually is. we were in a king bed room that had a small fridge & microwave in it. Room was clean and bed comfortable tv was of an older style, internet connection good. Found the choice on offer for breakfast to be extremley good with plenty to choose from. </DOC> I am always hesitant staying at Best Westerns but this one was great. The room was big and clean, comfortable beds and large TV. It was facing the main road so the traffic was a little loud (only noticed because I was sleeping during the day). The staff was very friendly and the breakfast was above average, a lot better than several hotel breakfasts I have had at hotels. </DOC> Love this Coos Bay hotel, very reasonable and always clean and tidy. I love their pool and hot tub. Simple breakfast in the morning and the staff have always been great. You can't go wrong here for sure. </DOC> It actually is in the middle of the road, Highway 101. Surprisingly quiet considering the traffic on both sides. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Their breakfast is superior to most Best Western offerings, The breakfast area is open and bright and helps to get your day started right. </DOC> We were on a winter road trip down the Oregon coast and Coos bay was an opportune layover. This hotel is right in town so it is close to stores and restaurants (the Blue Heron, reviewed elsewhere). The location is kind of unusual, sandwiched between two main thoroughfares, so there was a concern that it might be noisy. We got a two room suite that overlooked one of these roads and there was a little bit of noise but nothing that disturbed our sleep. It was room 278. Clean, comfy, typical Best West standard. Highly Recommended. </DOC> We requested a handicapped room and were very pleased with the room. It had a large roll-in shower with a shower chair. The room itself was very clean and spacious. The staff were very helpful in finding a good restaurant as well. Great place. </DOC> Good motel with friendly staff and exceptionally good breakfast. There is some road noise as it is situated on the main highway between the north and south branches. The traffic does however quieten down a lot at night, so we were not disturbed. The waterfront is only a few yards from the motel and there is a selection of restaurants - we liked the Thai restaurant along the street. The roms were clean and comfortable and we would not hesitate to stay here again."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"We booked an executive room and were delighted with it. Spacious, modern, spotlessly clean with a balcony overlooking the river. We borrowed bikes from reception and thought they were great, especially as they were free. We rode along the waterfront which was great, and later we walked along the waterfront into Hood River for dinner - about a mile, no need to drive. There's a proper Starbucks about 50 yards from the hotel. The outdoor pool was lovely with a jacuzzi, and breakfast the next morning was great, oh and to top it all the staff were very helpful and friendly. Top drawer. </DOC> We arrived at the same time as one of the other reviewers unless the key card making machine fails on a regular basis. Again we were let into our room which turned out to be a suite near the highway and bridge. This was slightly noisy and did not have a view of the river which was not a major disadvantage. Key cards were picked up from the desk. It is quite a large hotel extending along the river but the fittings are modern and work well. Our suite was large and part of the building was offices. The dining room had a good view but the food was unremarkable and was standard burgers etc. Breakfast was fine and freshly cooked. We were surprised that there was such a good hotel in such a rural area but it is a bit impersonal. </DOC> Notable positives - nice balcony overlooking the river, excellent restaurant and staff (breakfast included), very clean rooms, nice grounds. Notable negatives - no in room safe, refrigerator took up much of closet space (an odd location to have it), noisy air conditioner. Would definitely stay here again. </DOC> We've always wanted to stay at the Hood River Inn on our trips to and from Portland, Oregon, having stopped for breakfasts and dinner previously. This time we stayed so that we could get to the airport more easily and we are delighted that we did. We had a very comfortable king room facing the Columbia River. Very quiet and attractive. Dinner in the Riverside Grill was wonderful and the view was gorgeous. Free breakfast was excellent. Highly recommend!! </DOC> We decided to stay at this Best Western in Hood River for our 28th anniversary. We spent the day doing the fruit loop and got to the hotel mid afternoon. We were not disappointed! We had a room on the third floor with a view. The Columbia River was beautiful! The room was clean and had everything you needed. Unfortunately, the doors to the rooms down the hall kept slamming closed up until 11:00ish, when it finally quieted down. However, it started again around 6:00. If it would be possible to find a way so the doors closed quietly, that would be great because other guests tend to forget that there are others on the floor. That is the only negative thing about the hotel (and unfortunately, it is common in many). Regardless, we would definitely stay here again, if we are in the area. </DOC> Spent two nights here and loved it! We had a view of the Columbia River from our room which was large and spacious! The room was very clean. A free breakfast is offered which was a bonus for us. The waitresses were all very nice. Would recommend this as a great place to stay. </DOC> Arrived at Hood River after a drive through the Columbia Gorge from Portland and very pleased with room location, overlooking the river itself. Restaurant on site was a key factor in us booking this Best Western and pleased to say service & food excellent as was the large pool and associated facilities (which were also a draw for us). Only downsides would be the price being comparatively more above average than the facilties and the limited choices for the included breakfast at the restaurant (albeit quality & service remained high). </DOC> This is a very nice motel with well equipped rooms. We had a real high def tv with multiple HBO channels. Many of the rooms have beautiful views of the Columbia River. The breakfast that comes with the room is a coupon for a fully cooked meal in a very pretty setting. Would certainly stay here again."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'After a long drive it was nice to have a comfortable bed to sleep in. The room was very clean and quiet. The toilet has a slow close lid and great water pressure in the shower. My husband used the workout room and said it was clean and organized. The breakfast was not bad. Much better than at the Hampton Inns we\'ve stayed at. Very good value. </DOC> Got a larger than usual room. Unusually helpful staff, including breakfast staff. Walk to lots of restaurants and shopping. </DOC> Stayed here for a week. It was a very pleasant stay. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any issues, and it seemed like every interaction with the staff was pleasant. Loved the breakfast in the morning. Check in and check out was easy. I\xe2\x80\x99d recommend this hotel to anyone who\xe2\x80\x99s in the Klamath area needing a great hotel. </DOC> This hotel is brand new and very nice. My room was very large with a microwave and fridge. The bed was really comfortable. The bathroom was not huge, but it was modern. There is a business center with 2 computers, although they do charge for printing which I did not like. There is a small gym and an indoor pool (which is also small) and a hot tub. Breakfast was adequate with hot and cold choices. There are stores close by and although the hotel is on a main street, I heard no street noise at all. The hotel is only 3 miles from the airport which is also convenient. I would definitely stay there again if I was ever in th area. </DOC> This hotel gives the impression of being relatively new, being modern and well-maintained. My room was large and comfortable with all the facilities I needed. Check-in and check-out were quick and easy, thanks to friendly and efficient front desk staff. Breakfast was the usual HIE selection. I would happily stay at this hotel again. </DOC> My friend and I recently stayed at the Klamath Falls Holiday Inn Express while taking care of some family business. It was a last minute trip and we were able to get in on short notice. Everythng about our stay was excellent, the room, the ameneties, and the breakfest. There is a reason their cinnamon rolls are called "the worlds best cinnamon rolls". While the reason for our stay was not a pleasant one, our stay was a very pleasant one. </DOC> Again Holiday Inn Express gives us a great stay. The room was very comfortable, nicely furnished and very clean. The service at this hotel was especially good. The breakfast had many good selections. I highly recommend this hotel! </DOC> Glad we picked this hotel. The room was spacious, had a micro/fridge. The bed was very cushy, soft and just plain wonderful...........which is really the MAIN point of a hotel, isn\'t it? Water pressure in the shower was good, bathroom was spotless, interntet connection was very good. I was very happy with my stay (2 nights) and would definately use this hotel again.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"Older motel with large rooms close to the freway. It looked like the rooms had been recently remodeled.There is no elevator to second floor, so be sure to request a first floor room when you make your reservation. Standard cold breakfast. Good value. </DOC> Upon arrival, the front desk staff were extremely friendly and outgoing. We got a complementary upgrade to a suite which was much appreciated as we were weary travelers. The staff gave us map to a local restaurant which had good food in abundance. The bathroom amenities were first class. The suite was very clean and well appointed. The property was in a very quiet location and the bed was very comfortable so we had a wonderful sleep. The breakfast room was bright & cheery with a good variety of items. The mini-waffles were great as there were 4 to share. Good selection of fruit, scrambled eggs and healthy choices. We would not hesitate to recommend this property and will return again. </DOC> Our first go to chain for hotels is not Best Western, but we might have to change that. This one was great. I don't like heavy blankets and duvets where you are either too hot or too cold. This bed had a light sheet spread and light blanket and a heating/cooling system that was did what it was it was going to. Nice breakfast buffet, including chocolate for the oatmeal. :) No styrofoam which always wins points with me. The pool was a little cool but the hot tub was perfect. </DOC> Stopped here in the way to Seattle. Not much choice of hotel in Le Grande. Picked Best Western, it was pricey at $152.00 per night but they have a captive audience next to i84. Room was clean, bed was comfortable and breakfast was tasty but the hotel feels cheap and tired. </DOC> This place seems to be recently renovated and it shows. The rooms are mostly nice with good beds, very nice desk chairs and good TVs. They skimped a bit on the bathrooms, which although decent, are quite small (and the shower is not the greatest). Still, the location is good and easy to find and the breakfast is solid. I would stay there if I returned to La Grande. </DOC> We liked this place well enough to be return customers and once again had a very pleasant stay. The rooms are reasonably updated, beds comfy, linens crisp and clean, staff friendly and professional and the price is competitive for such amenities. What more can you ask for? </DOC> The room was very clean and nice. Beds were comfy and lots of pillows. The shower head in bathroom was great. We had a nice sized fridge in our room. As my title says the two ladies at the front desk were extremely helpful. Gave us directions to a Safeway nearby, as well as a recommendation for dinner. It was a Sunday and quite a few of the restaurants in the area were closed. The breakfast in the morning was pretty good. On the day we stayed there were scrambled eggs, sausage patties and potatoe patties. We were on the first floor and it was very quiet. I would stay here again if in the area in the future. </DOC> Our stay at tis BW Plus property was very nice. We arrived shortly before check-in time, but they soon found us a clean room. The staff was very courteous and helpful. Our roon was very quiet even tho they had a good amount of occupancy. Although we were close to the pool, we did not hear any of the usual noise from children having fun. the breakfast was beter than average for sure. The food was warm, a good variety especially for someone with c elia and not able to eat any wheagt products."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'I booked direct over the phone about a month before my trip. On arrival, the woman at the counter recognized my name and said she was the one who made my reservation. That\'s personal. The hotel from about the 80s and shows some wear. However, this is also from a time when the rooms were bigger. I enjoy the space. I reserved a queen but got a king (lucky). The room has a full desk, fast wifi, microwave, flat TV. Outside the room was a spacious garden with rhodys in bloom. I was able to park near my room. I\'d stay here again. </DOC> This has become one of our go-to stays while traveling the Oregon coast. The property is a little long in the tooth, but has been clean with nice service on each of our stays. The breakfast was easily the best we had during our holiday road trip (we\'re suckers for biscuits and gravy). A nice, affordable option while driving the 101. </DOC> This hotel is a very large property. Plenty of room for families and business folks. We really appreciated the fact that we were able to back our truck up to the door of our room and unload our shopping. There is a strip mall next door in the "same parking lot" that makes shopping and staying here very easy. The staff was fantastic and the breakfast was perfect. Very impressed. Thank you very much, Ken N. P.S. This hotel is not attached to the mall. </DOC> Older hotel but very well kept, clean rooms,large rooms,comfortable beds and quiet. The front desk staff were very friendly and informative. The only thing to pass along to other travelers is there is no elevator. </DOC> Had few reservations about staying at this property based on the reviews, but I\'m glad I stayed three days. This is an older property that is now a Quality Inn. While it shows it\'s age in a few places, management is making changes to make the Inn as good as newly built property. The room was absolutely huge, spotlessly clean, and very inexpensive compared to other properties located near the ocean. The staff were friendly, helpful, and professional. The expanded continental breakfast was as good as most Quality Inns. Readers of Trip Advisor should have no qualms about staying at this Quality Inn - as I will be doing so in the new future. </DOC> This hotel is older, but it is clean and everyone is friendly. I probably would not recommend it for a long stay, but for a short visit it is fine, and the price is right. I just needed a place to sleep on my way back from the Southern Oregon Coast. This fit the bill perfectly! They do have a free breakfast (the usual choices...boiled eggs, waffles, bagels, cereal and milk), so that makes the deal even better! </DOC> Stayed here the first week of September. We got soaked for $115.00 including taxes for a maximum $70.00 room. The room was standard and relatively clean although there was a musty smell to contend with. I will bypass North Bend and Coos Bay entirely next time and stay somewhere else. The woman ahead of me was checking out and paid $79.00 for her room - that rankled even more. </DOC> More like 2 1/2 circles. I could not give it 3. Not up to the Choice Hotels Quality line. Definitely more of a Econo Lodge. This is a dated hotel and it looks like they are trying to make it better. Bed was springy and sleep was only ok. A lot of rooms in several buildings across from a shopping center that needs work as well. The highlight was in the parking lot just in front of the hotel, The Human Bean drive through coffee hut. The breakfast helps get the rating up. An odd find in a hotel, the living area was all Pergo style hardwood flooring. Makes the room feel a little cold. There is a multiplex cinema within walking distance of the hotel.'

SUMMARY:  b'nestled in the country is a little pricey but this is a hotel with a great location and view from our room was just ok and the beds were not comfortable . stayed here twice while visiting family in the area and have to say my opinion , i have to say that this is a good hotel .would stay again if i have a business trip to glee , or for the price</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"A slightly better Fairfield in a good location. The room was clean and typical for a Fairfield. Breakfast was also typical but satisfactory. The staff was very nice and helpful. The rate was very good. Nothing exceptional but you really don't expect that in a good budget-type Marriott property. I would stay there again. </DOC> We\xe2\x80\x99ve stayed here a couple times because it\xe2\x80\x99s a hardly place to spend the night before an early morning flight. We\xe2\x80\x99ve decided it\xe2\x80\x99s time to select a different hotel for these stays. The hotel is worn and dated and the desk help just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to want to be bothered with serving guests. </DOC> This hotel delivers on what it purports to be: clean, pleasant but basic accomodations. The hotel felt relatively new. We found the front desk staff to be particularly pleasant and helpful. Our room was spotless and comfortable. The breakfast was good. We also liked the location in that we were minutes away from Cascade Station- a new shopping center with several restaurants. We had dinner there. We also enjoyed looking around the huge Ikea. Though navigating around this area is a bit challenging though that isn't unusual for an area near an airport- with various highway entrances and exits and one-way perimeter roads. </DOC> Room was nicely appointed but on the small side. The shower and tiolet were in a separate room that even with the fan running could keep the moisture from running down the door. Vanity had very little counter space. Other than those small issues the hotel was very nice. With walking distance to a few dining options. Good bed. </DOC> I stayed here recently for 3 nights and had a most pleasant experience. I had stayed here several years ago while in Portland and enjoyed my stay at that time as well. It does appear that the hotel has had some fairly recent remodeling and it has improved some areas. My room was immaculate as was the bathroom. Carpet looked clean in the room, in the hallway and in the lobby. Front desk staff were very professional and helpful. Location is perfect as I was flying in and out of the airport and traveling into Washington state. There are many restaurants nearby this hotel and a rapid rail station (Cascade Station) very near the airport. Also, a shopping area is near the rail station which has some nice stores if one wants to do some shopping. I will definitely be staying here again. </DOC> I have stayed at this Fairfield Inn on a number of occasions in the past when flying out of Portland Airport and have never been disappointed. The facility is attractive, rooms are comfortable, bedding and towels are topnotch. Wi-fi is complimentary, easily accessible, and dependable. Complimentary breakfast is generous. The complimentary shuttle to the airport is a clincher. This is a great choice for air travelers. </DOC> We had a nice, large room with two double beds (we would have preferred a queen or king, but they were outside our budget. My wife's bed was rather soft, so she did not have the best night's sleep. Mine was firm, so I was OK. Do understand that the hotel is a long, long way from downtown, but convenient for the airport. </DOC> We parked for 16 days and then spent the night upon our return to PDX. Fairfield Inn staff at both ends of our trip were friendly, helpful and responsive. Room was nicely decorated, with a comfortable bed, all amenities and an impressive breakfast buffet the next morning. Quiet setting, easy to sleep and recuperate from our jet lag. All that, including parking, for about $100! Next time we fly out of PDX, I plan to stay here!!"

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"The hotel looks almost new. The bedding was really comfortable. Even though I got the hotel on a discount site, they gave me a very nice room. The room was spacious and was well equipped. The only down sides were that the doors are thin and conversations on the hall were noisy. (This tends to be the case at most hotels. so I wish people would save their conversations for their rooms). The business lounge was really lovely. The restaurant had better quality food than most hotels. I don't care for the location. It is in an industrial area near the Portland Airport that is challenge to find or leave. You can't walk anywhere. This hotel is great for folks who want to spend a night before or after a flight at PDX, but don't stay here if you are on vacation and visiting Portland. </DOC> We found the Radisson very nice as a place to campout the night before an early flight. The rooms were large and the bed was very comfortable. It had a small restaurant which we did not use, but It looked adequate for the purpose. The front desk was efficient and the shuttle service was very good - it was scheduled for you with a pass when you checked in and was based on your flight time - a very short ride to the airport. My only beef was that the internet seemed to have limited range, but really didn't matter as we arrived later in the evening and needed to call it a night because of the flight. I'd stay again before a flight. </DOC> The room is updated, the bed is really comfortable and the sheets and bedding are lovely. The restaurant is pretty good for a restaurant at a hotel. I highly recommend this hotel. The staff were so helpful and treated us really well. The wifi was the best I have experienced at a hotel all year. </DOC> Stayed two nights on way up to Seattle. Plenty of free parking and a very busy hotel. Okay facilities and large room. Clean modern and tidy. Not tired. A little confusing to find the first time. Our hire car rear ended and staff helped to coordinate tow driver to pick up car with min fuss. No complaints. </DOC> The Radisson at PDX is one of the nicer hotels I have stayed at in the area. The property is quite loved and well cared for. The parking lot was quite large. All the doors are secured for your safety. I found the rooms to be large and well appointed. We had a pair of sleep number queens beds that were extremely comfortable. My buddy was also able to use the Iphone doc to recharge his phone. We both enjoyed the fridge and microwave as we brought snacks and beverages too. I will look forward to my next stay at this location. </DOC> This hotel is a great choice if you want to stay near the airport. It's got a very fast shuttle connecting to it, which you can grab at any time or book to be sure you're making it on time. Rooms, service, and parking were all very good. They also have a good restaurant, though it was pretty crowded when we were there (the day after the 2017 eclipse, so it's understandable). </DOC> We stayed here for four nights while visiting our daughter who lives in Portland. It only took us 15 minutes (or less) to drive to her house northeast of downtown. Parking was easy--staff was helpful. One of the strengths of this property is its restaurant and bar. Will definitely stay here again when visiting Portland. </DOC> The good - service quick and professional, they even had a freshly baked cookie at reception for guests checking in. Room surprisingly spacious. Bed comfortable. Lots of parking on site and a shuttle bus available. Friendly bar staff. Competitive pricing. The not so good - restaurant meals adequate, but not great. Given its an airport motel people are up and about very late and very early making a good sleep a challenge. All in all a good offering in a good location."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'I stayed here two nights. Even with my gps and visual spot of the inn I took a wrong turn and it took me another 20 minutes to get back to the hotel. The access is the worst I have ever seen for a hotel. The Marriott should have insisted on better access when it built this multi-property complex. Otherwise, it was very good. The staff were excellent, though the room renew was very late. I ventured out the first day at 7 a.m. and my room was in progress of cleaning at 4:30 when I returned. There were no plastic cups, only coffee cups, which was not very nice in hot weather when I wanted a cool drink. The air conditioning worked well, but is a below window unit and is noisy if left on overnight. </DOC> This review is written by a business travel who frequents Hilton and Marriott-branded properties throughout the world (primarily North America). Summary Great choice of hotel in the Portland area - relatively close to shopping and downtown. Opened on May 14, 2008. If this is the vision for Farifield Inns in the future, the future looks bright for the Marriott Brand. Pros - New hotel - new carpet smell, fresh! - Great bathrooms with marble countertops, curved shower bars. - bright areas throughout each room and suite. - Good service. - Close relative proximity to shopping and downtown. - New LG 32-37" LCD TVs. - Fresh, soothing decor throughout. Cons - Little confusing to get to the actual road that leads to the property. </DOC> This Fairfield Inn provided a reasonable stay with nothing outstanding to make it stand out. Here are some of its weaknesses: (1) it is hard to find, being hidden behind other Marriott hotels on a narrow street; (2) the heat control in the room did not work: (3)the food in the dining room often ran out. The beds were comfortable and the staff was friendly. It is worth an average rating as compared to other similar hotels. </DOC> I stay here for business often, very often. At least 2 or 3 nights a month. While not the fanciest or best hotel I have stayed at, it is what I compare al business hotels to. Nice lobby, good business center, free continental, clean pool, clean rooms, and wifi that actually works. The place was always quiet and the staff are helpful and nice. My only complaint is the hotel is next to a busy road and the interstate because you can definitely hear every semi truck that drives by. While it does not bother me, I can see that as a big minus to some. I sleep with the fan on high. I recommend to get a room on the parking lot side of the hotel. </DOC> Check in was fast and friendly. The room was clean. Good shower pressure. Plenty of hot water. Curved shower bar. Comfortable bed and pillows. Microwaye adn fridge. Breakfast buffet was fine. But two MAJOR issues. 1) Wifi was non-existent on Sunday night. Monday morning it was working OK, but absolutely terrible Sunday night. 2) It\'s a few yards from the on-ramp to the highway. They supplied ear-plugs. I didn\'t think anything of it UNTIL 5:30 AM Monday morning, when trucks and cars were non-stop until we checked out. Really loud. </DOC> We stayed here one night. The hotel is new-ish and in the same area as other Marriott hotels (think there is a Courtyard, Residence Inn in the same large lot). While the hotel was alright and the staff pleasant enough, we did not care of the location-looked sort of industrial, and there are major roads nearby (lots of noise) and the night we stayed there seemed to be a traffic jam. From what we could tell, there were no restaurants in the area (except the pizza place, and a sandwich place in the large parking/shopping area of the hotel). If we are in the Portland area again for leisure, we would skip this hotel and select a different location. </DOC> Just checked out after a one-night stay at this hotel. The Fairfield Inn, the Residence Inn and the Courtyard share the same neighbourhood. Portland is just ten minutes drive. At first we were really impressed by this hotel. Very new and fresh, a nice room and bright common areas. But the following day we realized that some services were too poor concerning the size of the property and the potential number of guests. Maybe we were just unlucky since it was Friday and the hotel seemed to be sold out, but we weren\'t able to find a free table for breakfast, we had to wait a lot to get the only one elevator and, checking out, we couldn\'t find any available cart since the only two were being used elsewhere. So in the end a very nice property but spaces and services could have been planned in a better way. I would be back anyway. </DOC> This hotel was okay. It is not the easiest hotel to find. Thankfully, we arrived during the day and could see it once we exited the highway. Ask for a room on the quiet, parking lot side. The other side of the hotel is near I-5 and there is a lot of traffic including many 18 wheelers. The room was clean and the shower was good with plenty of hot water. The free wi-fi was very reliable. Breakfast was good with enough variety. Overall, I recommend this hotel. Just be aware that it is more difficult to get to than typical Fairfield Inns.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"This hotel is nicely situated. Plenty within a walk distance. During our a the elevator was malfunctioning. Taking us to the basement. Unfortunately the stairs were only usable in an emergency? Not sure why that restriction. The room was nice. However the switch plates and electrical receptacles all we left behind during the reno, so although the paint is fresh, the switches are old, beige and dirty. Nice place but a lot of money for what you get. </DOC> I've been a Kimpton fan for a long time, so when we were choosing a place for our 35-person company retreat, I was already inclined to choose a Kimpton hotel. And the Riverplace Hotel did not disappoint. The fact that we could have both rooms in the main hotel, plus condos next door for our employees with families was great. The food was unusually good, the communal tables in the bar and restaurant worked well for us, plus plenty of fireplace nooks and other areas where our team could hang-out. We also used their conference rooms for our meetings, and the staff provided excellent service for our whole 3-day event. Highly recommended. </DOC> Place is a class act. Want a bike? Complementary...just ask. Great meal? Three Degrees.....or walk a few steps to a dozen other choices. Drinks with a view. Grab a rocking chair on the porch, looking down the Williamette toward all the action. Room are great. Look for special pricing. Rack rates are too high. </DOC> The RiverPlace Hotel was our first stop of a 5 week trip through the Pacific NW. We had a King Corner room looking over the park. Very spacious, bed super comfortable and bathroom just fine. All staff were terrific. Loved the bar area and the restaurant, though we only ate breakfast there. Great location as well. Would stay here again. </DOC> Recently stayed for brief stop in Portland and enjoyed a very good visit. Location is great, right on the river in downtown. Room was a good size and well equipped. Bed was comfortable, room was quiet and sleep was great. Bathroom had good amenities and towels were good. Overall a very good stay for a short business trip. I would return and stay again when in Portland. </DOC> What a great hotel. Beautiful rooms, excellent service, great restaurant with happy hour specials. Nice King Size pillows on the bed - woo hoo! The ONLY negative is that the location is between two bridges and there are railroad tracks across the river which can make for a noisy evening. But if you don't mnd that - then this is the place. I would return just for the pillows! </DOC> We spent two nights enjoying the location of the RiverPlace. Loved the art everywhere, the wine at 5pm and the warm cookies! Thoughtful lemon water always available in the lobby as well. Our large room was beautifully decorated, with plenty of electric receptacles all over. Luxurious bath towels and amenities! The negatives would be: poor lighting, and the thermostat really didn't keep the room comfortable. Staff was friendly. </DOC> I had always wanted to stay at this hotel and finally decided to do so. The view of the river was terrific and was the room and amenities. It had a very comfortable bed and large bathroom with tub and shower. The room service was excellent as was the entire staff. They were helpful in arranging travel and outings around Portland. There are some great Restaurants with in walking distance of the hotel. This hotel is also pet friendly for those who are looking for this option with their trip. I plan to use the hotel on future visits to Portland."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"Not a hipster in sight. No brew pubs within walking distance. Why on earth should you stay here?!? We were in town to do some hiking in the Columbia River Gorge and wanted to have a short drive each day. Location was perfect -- far enough from the interstate to be quiet, close enough for quick access. Room was spacious, QUIET and comfortable. WiFi worked great and lots of plugs to charge our ever-growing collection of electronics. Room also had a fridge and microwave. Breakfast was more than cold carbs . . . . bacon, biscuits and gravy, et al. Needed to hike to burn off those calories! Staff were friendly and helpful. </DOC> The Best Western Troutdale is a convenient drive to the Columbia River Gorge, Mt. Hood and Portland City and Airport. Troutdale is a small town east of Portland but it has a Walmart and many nice local restaurant. The staff here was extra nice and we had a clean room with free Wi-Fi and breakfast. Hotel is about 2 minutes from I-84 so you do not get any highway noise. </DOC> Drove in from salt lake and arrived late. The front desk guy seemed a little overwhelmed by a German family so we had to wait a very long time to check in and then he charged me extra for my son and his wife. I guess that's the policy but after waiting so long it might have been a nice gesture to let that go. The hotel was nice and very clean </DOC> Great place to stay in Troutdale/Gresham. Newer property beautifully furnished, Easy access to freeway. Room was huge and nicely furnished. Very clean quiet and bed very comfortable. Breakfast adequate nice selection of items, well displayed. Definitely will stay here again. </DOC> We stayed here one night on our road trip and on the way to Multnomah Falls. Everything was pretty good, average to be expected for a Best Western. The front desk service was ok, it took a very long time to check in, the line was very long and there was only one person working. Overall, it was an average-decent stay and we would stay here again if in the neighborhood. </DOC> I can't believe I never wrote a review for this place as we've stayed here 3 or 4 times in the last several years--most recently last year on the night before Thanksgiving. It's a nice proximity to Portland, easy to get in and out of and ample parking. Front desk is always friendly and helpful. Plus, breakfast is usually pretty decent. We almost always get upgraded to a larger room due to my Elite status, which is great when you have a toddler to have more space to move around. Overall, I recommend this place and have had family stay here as well. </DOC> I appreciate the consistent level of service. Always clean and comfortable. Not fancy but your not paying a fancy price either. rooms nicely furnished with comfortable beds. Clean and quiet with a nice selection of items for breakfast. </DOC> This hotel is in a good location, east of Portland, Oregon. It is convent to interstate 84, but far enough from it so you don't hear the noise. The room is very nicely furnished, the bath is modern and very clean. My only negative is that the in-room coffee maker didn't work. Breakfast was ok."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"This was a convenient stop during our drive in between CT and Detroit. It was easy to access off I-80 and had high marks on Trip Advisor. We had high expectations for $149 per night. Room was clean, neat and comfortable. Beds were comfortable. Parking was easy and plentiful. Check in was easy. Although across the street from the hospital we didn't hear any noise even though our room faced that side. A typical Hampton Inn positive experience with the exception that for being in a small town in Western PA we found the room rate too high. Would find another hotel in a different town at a cheaper rate next time or hope this one is in the$109-119 range. </DOC> Hampton Inn delivers again. We always know when we are traveling that a Hampton Inn is a good choice. Well-appointed, immaculate room with comfortable bed. Complimentary breakfast could be better, but it is adequate. </DOC> Each year on our way home we stay at this hotel. The price is right, the rooms are always clean and comfortable and the staff is very friendly. It's a great half way destionation between our home and that of our family in New York State. Again this year, we were not disappointed. NOT the Ritz Carlton, but a great place to stay at a reasonable rate. Several decent restaurants close by. </DOC> This hotel is clean and comfortable. I can recommend staying there. My only complaints are: 1. Only one clerk with no help after 4 pm. Having a pool, I feel that is very dangerous since they are uncomfortable leaving the desk unattended. They need to periodically check it no matter what disclaimers they have. They also need to be able to leave the desk if a guest needs help. 2. No fridges in the room. 3. This is not this hotel's fault, but I am not crazy about the vinyl floors Hampton is having their franchisers put in. All in all, if i were in the area, I would stay again. </DOC> The property is located with easy access. Upon arrival I found everything in order, clean and ready for my stay. I used digital check-in which was wonderful. Use it all the time. Room was as expected, clean and smelled fresh. </DOC> The hotel is conveniently located off the highway 80 and about 3/4 of the way from NYC to Cleveland. The room was clean and large with two queen size beds. The staff friendly. A warm breakfast including eggs, waffles, cereals, yogurt and fresh fruit offered. If you have AAA they have a reasonable rate. Not much to do in the area. </DOC> My wife and I decided to stay here on our way to Chicago and this hotel was superb. All of the staff members were friendly and helpful. We paid a fair price here. Our room was big and spacious and clean. The bed was comfortable and the sheets were fresh and clean. The hotel is easily accessible from I-80 at Exit 62. And there are a few stores and restaurants nearby for added convenience. We will definitely stay here again </DOC> Stopped here for the night on the way home from a business trip. Great access from Route 80, not much in the area, a walmart, McDonalds, seems a bit depressed. Friendly front desk staff, clean room, no refrigerator though....kind of strange for a Hampton. Don't stay in a room with an adjoining door, EXTREMELY easy to hear your neighbors and mine were load after midnight. Breakfast was great, as always.....free cut fruit needed some help (if I need to find something to complain about)."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"This hotel has just moved to Best Western from another brand. The hotel is relatively new. We stayed there while on moving south to Maryland. The rooms are good. The hot tub is great, and much appreciated. The breakfast is good. Our only problem was a large group of teenagers that descended upon our floor in the evening. They decided the hall was an extension of the room, with much noise until late at night. I told them to stop, with some success. The hotel had to intervene as well. This is tough for hotel managers, as they usually do not have the tools to deal with moderately rowdy visitors. </DOC> We stay here every year in November. Breakfast is great, room is wonderful, and staff is always friendly & professional. It is only 10 minutes from the Farm Complex. The Irish Pub attached is convenient and the food is excellent. </DOC> A bit below the average Wingate. Though rooms seemed clean, the upkeep was below average - grout and ceiling in the bathroom needed attention. The breakfast area was a mess and poorly stocked, and the gal working there was moving slow and uninterested in her job. There's a motel adjacent to the property that looked like a great location to hide a meth lab. I don't think saving about 30% by staying here vs nearby hotels was worth it. </DOC> The staff was wonderful, we came in to town for the RV show in Hershey. Corey accommodated us at every turn. Our shower water was unbearably hot and could not be adjusted, so Corey sent up a key to the room across the hall, where we showered. He also saw to it that breakfast stayed open just a LITTLE longer, so we could get there after the shower debacle. Breakfast and the breakfast staff were very pleasant. All in all, we would return! </DOC> I arrived at 4pm and was told my room wasn't clean yet. Why not? The wifi was spotty on the 3rd floor center (near the elevator). When it did work it was very slow. My room was not cleaned on 2 of the 3 mornings I was there. My work associate had all his towels taken and not replaced. Breakfast was OK. They have waffles and carbs with 1 protein. If you like cereal bring your own. They use the real cheap stuff that tastes like sawdust. Mediocre hotel at best </DOC> We stayed here 2 nights & there were very few people but we found the hotel & room to be above average. Free parking,breakfast & internet. Our internet service was very good. We liked our location....10 minutes to downtown Harrisburg, 15 minutes to Hershey. Staff was friendly. Rooms were big & clean. I'd stay here again. Mattress was a little too soft for our liking. </DOC> We stayed in this hotel from November 8 till 11 in room 222. When we entered the room, there was no remote control. The young guy at the desk had to come back twice before he found one that worked. The pressure in the shower is poor. The first morning most of the items in the breakfast room were missing. Apparently a large group took everything early in the morning. The man responsible for breakfast was alone and had to process the supply delivery that came in at the same time. We expressed our concerns at the manager. The second day the problem with the shower pressure was fixed. We were compensated for the this. </DOC> Last minute trip to take the kids to Hershey. Hotel is about 20 minutes away which is not bad, Clean appearance with plenty of parking. Nice reception area and check in was simple and flawless. Room was very clean, with comfortable beds and accessories. Wifi worked great, bathroom was clean and shower had good pressure. Breakfast was very good with a good selection of hot and cold and they kept it stocked. Would definitely stay here again and would recommend to anyone looking for a nice hotel while visiting the area."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"We took the family, 3 children 20 to 26 and boy/girl friends for a post Christmas spa day. The facilities offer a 16m pool, spa pool, sauna and steam room. There were not many other guests so there was plenty of room. The hotel has about 45 rooms, but we did not stay. We each had one treatment and the massage was very good, with a large room which had two massage tables, some nice background music, and a very pleasant masseuse. We also had lunch of sanwiches and banana smoothies which were very good. Afterwards we had high tea in the library, a very nice quiet area with plenty of seats. The tea was excellent, lots of sandwiches, scones and cakes, and very good value. All in all a very nice boxing day treat. </DOC> We went for the gala meal with a large group of friends.welcome was good with champagne and canap\xc3\xa9s. Food and entertainment were great, only downside was the lack of bar staff, 20 mins to order a drink and bottle of wine... Not acceptable. Then they had no champagne glasses so resorted to washing one up in toilets...really?! Apart from that though we had a wonderful evening and would go again. \xc2\xa399was good value for money for what was experienced. </DOC> Never fails to disappoint and what value for money! Visited with my son and played golf on what is a great course. Evening meal was great as usual and already looking forward to our next visit! Lovely staff and luxurious d\xc3\xa9cor through out. </DOC> Myself and my partner came here for our anniversary. It was a great place to pick, being close to Bath, and also being situated in beautiful grounds, which we went walking in. The rooms are lovely and clean, the bathrooms modern and stylish, and there are even homemade cookies for you on arrival. The meal we had in the restaurant and the breakfast was delicious, with a vast choice of food. The only letdown was that the wine we had with our meal was not great, and for \xc2\xa335 it should have been! The spa and swimming pool area was lovely. The bar was well stocked, and the barman was very knowledgable and friendly. I would recommend this for a romantic getaway. </DOC> You want a spa , a round of golf , serenity in the English countryside , with a decent menu and attentive service , with hotel rooms that are just about right .....or a mix of the above , well Bowood has to be up there. The golf course is lovely , challenging , set in a rolling landscape , and well looked after. The hotel rooms well appointed , comfortable , no more or less than expectations , ok , slightly better than average for the price. The restaurant is the surprise : pigeon breast ; pea risotto ; turbot ; and a cheese board of distinction , plus a wine list of balance of range and choice...........there must be someone in the know behind all of these elements. Whoever it is , bravo or bravada. A great venue for couples , corporates or golfers. If you are all three , perfect. </DOC> Stayed with a friend for a very overdue catch-up and what a treat, our room overlooked the grounds/golf course, the weather was beautiful so we explored and took advantage of a free pass to Bowood House. Room wonderful, lovely spa, 5 star food and wine !!! we shall return. </DOC> I stay here every month and this place retains it's excellent standards. Always a lovely welcome on reception. Rooms are perfect Menus changes regularly and breakfast is well cooked I'm not a golfer, but the course looked well maintained with great facilities </DOC> Easy to understand why this place is so well reviewed. The hotel, food, service and leisure facilities are excellent and the golf course is great too! Spacious well equiped bedroom. No wonder this was not my first, nor hopefully last, visit! Good value"

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"A gem of a find. A great little hotel right on the High Street (free parking outside - though a 2 hour restriction applies during the day). Rooms are chalet style, spacious and well decorated.The bed was extremely comfortable. Bathroom was modern and clean. Alongside the usual tea, coffee, etc there was complimentary bottles of mineral water. There's also a great bar and restaurant. Breakfast was excellent (especially the sausages). Serving staff were a little surly especially in comparison with the jovial receptionist. The only negative was the slightly slow wi-fi. </DOC> We stayed just over a week ago on a Saturday night. We had two rooms at the front of the hotel overlooking the High Street.We were warmly welcomed at the check in desk.Lovely modern room with tea/coffee/bottled water. Excellent en suite bathroom with nice toiletries. Bed very comfortable with good bedding. Also in room fan, iron and ironing board. Good breakfast- freshly cooked for us. We liked it so much that we have booked another visit for December. (Good location for local walks) </DOC> My fianc\xc3\xa9e and I stopped here wk before Xmas and had a lovely time. We stayed in the new accommodation out back which was top notch. Had a fantastic meal in the restaurant too. Very pleased. We werereally looked after from the moment we walked through the front door. Only negative would be breakfast did take about 30mins to come out which isnt great if you have a meeting to get too but I am been picky here </DOC> A very nice welcome when I put my head around the door to see if they were open for coffee. A great building - lots of history - with attentive staff who came and put logs on the fire every 30 mins or so. Super atmosphere and we sat and chatted very comfortably. Stayed for lunch and I have never seen such generous sandwiches! Home made soup was thick and very tasty. Lovely food and great staff. </DOC> The Angel Hotel is an old building with a modern wing, where I stayed. Large comfortable and extremely clean room, modern spacious bathroom with shower, flat-screen TV, and good, free Wifi. There is also close free car-parking - overall an excellent place to stay. Best description: cosy. Then there is the breakfast - fresh (farm fresh) ingredients cooked individually - one of the best hotel breakfasts I have had in years!! Friendly and helpful staff complete a perfect stay. Moreover, the hotel is centrally located - close to the remarkable Town Hall. </DOC> This is my first visit to the Angel although my husband has stayed here many times on business and has always rated it highly. Lovely room in the old hotel with every comfort. Service good even though they were absolutely packed. Didn't have time to use the pool but it looked very inviting. I would be happy to return! </DOC> Heard that the Angel has a great reputation, its now back in Arkell hands but seemed very good on all levels. Loving looking establishment from the outside and a great blend of old and new inside. Menu is varied in range, good presentation and quality matched with good service. The prices are top end for lunch and seemed much the same for evening, but you cant fault anything so I would suggest it money well spent. I will return and highly recommend. </DOC> I stayed at The Angel for one night whilst visiting friends. Note there is no parking for the hotel, but there are parking spaces directly in front of the hotel on the High Street, as it was a Sunday there was no charge up till 10.00 hrs on Monday. My room was in a block at the rear of the hotel, it was large and comfortable, no A/C so it was too warm for me. There is free WiFi,free view TV & tea/coffee in each room. As you are centrally located there are plenty of bars and shops less than 1 minute away. The pub/restaurant is popular so it can get busy. I only had breakfast which was of good quality and used locally sourced food. The staff were friendly and the room rate is good, I would stay again."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'I should have read more reviews before booking! Great if you want a lads night out with no sleep and a so so breakfast - not great if you actually want to sleep interrupted. We got "upgraded" to move us away from the disco but the room was pretty shabby, the bathroom door didn\'t fit and the overall impression wasn\'t great. Got woken twice during the night while party goners roamed the hotel trying to find their room. No hotel staff around to assist. Breakfast was included and was OK, staff weren\'t particularly friendly or helpful in explaining what was on offer. Definitely won\'t be returning. </DOC> My friends and I stayed at Bredbury Hall on 16th July; we also booked a table for eight in the restaurant. The rooms were a bit rough and ready but good enough for the one night we stayed, and the food in the restaurant could not be faulted. The Disco was also very good with a great mixture of music, this goes on until 2pm. Everyone then descends into the residents bar where there is Karaoke, I think this is supposed to start at 2am, but by the time the guy finishes messing about it does not start until 2.30am which is a bit late for most unless your too drunk to bother. It would be much better if the Karaoke started at 1am as the residents bar is dead with hardly anybody in this room as nothing is happening, not even background music, when we were in there people were having a sing song between themselves. </DOC> Posted from my iPad whilst staying at property, in a Deluxe Room. The reception was frosty. No \'Welcome\', \'Nice to see you\' or \'How was your journey\'. Just two words, \'Surname please\'. Similar to the welcome in my local Doctor Surgery. I bought two drinks from the bar, a Barcadi & coke and soda water with a dash of lemon. \xc2\xa37.20. My last visit here was in 1996, the bedroom looks exactly the same except for a flat screen TV, the bathroom has not been changed either. Towels are good quality, as are the toiletries. The bedroom is spacious and worth paying \xc2\xa310 extra. Not my favourite hotel in the world by a long way. </DOC> Parked on the very outskirts of Manchester this hotel is very easy to get to if your coming from the south or east, we stayed on a Friday night and were only charged\xc2\xa360 including breakfast. We had a huge room on the third floor with the biggest and fluffiest towels. The hotel also has its own night club but its situated a short walk from the rooms therefore those, like us, who were too tired to boogie are not disturbed by it. Staff were great, bar prices very sensible for a change and the buffet breakfast was as good as it gets. </DOC> Stayed between Christmas and new year while visiting family in the area. Reception and bar area have been nicely refurbished and look very fresh. Room large, clean and above all in a quiet spot as I had requested. Staff very pleasant and helpful. Lovely open fire in the restaurant. Breakfast fresh and great value for money. Just wish bar service was quicker. Maybe a call bell for quieter periods would help. Really great hotel though and I recommend it. </DOC> I had the pleasure of staying at The Bredbury Hall Hotel & Country Club for just one night before a conference the following day and unfortunately could not use all of the hotels facilities. This hotel and grounds are like a Tardis there is so much to see, you really need a map to get you around the hotel, but it had excellent standards. My bedroom was a mini suite with large four poster style bed, Jacuzzi bath and more than ample furniture, only complaint was the TV was not working correctly. The bar and restaurant was very friendly and well stocked, both the dinner and breakfast were of good quality and cooked to your own liking. This was my first stay but will not be my last. </DOC> Always use this as a base when visiting family locally. Rooms are fine. Large and with everything you need. Public areas looking a bit tired. I always get a good nights\' sleep. Reception staff in particular extremely helpful. Paul Savage is especially professional. He dealt with an issue I had positively and constructively. He is a model of how customer service should be. Breakfast experience pretty sloppy by comparison. They have given up on setting tables so you have to even collect your own cutlery and get tea from a flask. Salt and pepper pots dirty. What a shame. The restaurant seems to be going from bad to worse. Difference between reception experience and catering is worlds apart. </DOC> I am writing this review in retrospect, as I stayed there April 2013. The hotel is very nice, and the check in was smooth and without issue. The Bar was good, although they did run out of San Miguel! I didn\'t rate the restaurant much - the food was okay, but I didn\'t find it amazing. There was an issue on checking out, in which the bill from the restaurant hadn\'t appeared on my bill. Being honest, I pointed this out, and this was paid on my credit card and a receipt sent on to me. I stayed here with work. If I had to travel again, I would stay here again.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"First time I've stayed in this particular Premier Inn, have been in both better and worse. Rooms were the usual standard, but checking in was tedious and slow. Not sure if receptionist is new and didn't know the system or whether being awkward with a colleagues room, however it took far longer than seemed necessary to resolve. Also, for some reason the receptionists seat is very low so you are peering down on them, never come across that before. No one around when I wanted to get some extra milk and couldn't be bothered to wait. So, it did the job but wasn't my best PI experience. Free parking is nice though. Whitton station 5 mins walk away, stadium about 15 to 20 along the road. </DOC> The main reason I booked this was that it was 1.1 mile from Twickenham Stadium and it meant we could walk backwards and forwards for the rugby. The staff were lovely and helpful and the rooms really good as usual. </DOC> Just had 4 nights at this Premier Inn whilst working nearby. Since my last visit more rooms have been added, and the remainder of the hotel completely renovated. Very pleasant rooms, and very clean, with very friendly staff. It's a great shame but I would not choose this hotel again purely because the attached Fayre & Square restaurant is absolutely shocking, and there is not a wide selection of local restaurants to use instead. Do not pay for a Premier Inn breakfast, which is served in the attached pub, as it's inedible. Even the coffee is cold. I know the Fayre and Square brand is not owned by Whitbread, but this pub will destroy this very pleasant hotel by preventing people staying there. </DOC> A bit mixed feelings; potentially good for a quick short stay and when looking budget stay in neighbourhood. Had problems to alter room temperature, or keep warm enough, if a pub nearby is closed (in our case was closed earlier than supposed in couple of nights) then the only option is automat in reception (takes only small cash, and reception could not or didn't want to change my 20\xc2\xa3 so did not have even water). Room cleaning average, though did not noticed empty shampoo-rack for two days even put that on display. Average breakfast - only instant coffee! </DOC> Bit of a dreary Premier Inn - the sort where we are happy paying \xc2\xa332 per night. However, market forces allow a rate closer to \xc2\xa3150 a night on match weekends. Hotel staff pleasant. Allocated quiet room as requested. Room ready for a refurb, but usual Premier Inn facilities. Pub next door provides Premier Inn breakfast. Pretty awful. Not enough staff. Horrible coffee, help yourself from flasks. No choice of tea. Many listed items missing (of course, explained in the small print). Chef could not cook bacon or eggs well. Raw fat on bacon, solid fried eggs. We mentioned to Premier Inn receptionist. He was clearly aware of the situation and refunded the cost of our breakfasts. Disappointing that Premier Inn sells inferior breakfasts, under the Premier Inn brand. </DOC> This is the first 'makeover/new style' Premier Inns we have stayed in. New decor - very 'on trend' as the TV programs would say..lots of dark wood, quality fittings and the same comfy beds. Friendly and helpful staff, quiet and well placed. Massive TV with all the inputs you need beneath, HDMI, USB and others - kettle that boils at the speed of light. All in all FANTASTIC ... Well placed for the stadium for the sports lovers and Whitton overland train station is a 10 minute walk via the back of the hotel. Can't fault it ! Will be here again for sure ... </DOC> Probably better than it looks from the main road ..... smaller than usual Premier Inn at a guess but friendly staff and cheerful interior. Pub / restaurant and breakfast across car park in adjacent pub (the Winning Post or something) which is decent enough and serves up a good breakfast. Rooms are being done out at time of writing, which will bring them all up to modern standard. I was worried there may have been a little noise from main road but that wasn't an issue at all. Only stayed a couple of times on business ....... my guess is that it is a good 20 - 30 minute walk to the stadium but would guess it is an atmospheric walk on a match day. Would stay again. </DOC> Travelling to Heathrow and wanted to stay over a bit closer. This was exceptional value and there is parking on site for the night. Next to a pub that serves reasonably priced food and drinks. Room at the back, which was quiet. It is on a busy road but we had no problem with the noise."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"We looked for a spa style Hotel that wasn't stuck up or too formal and were delighted when we found The Scarlet. This place is amazing for couples and its an added bonus that no children are allowed. The rooms are decorated beautifully, however, there was no separate toilet room, the shower and toilet are hidden behind a glass screen in your room which looks great but there is no privacy for the toilet. That's the only negative thing I can say. The food is fantastic and the location and view from your room is stunning. I would definitely recommend the double treatment for couples and the private hot tub experience. We stayed for three nights which was enough to relax and not get bored. </DOC> Wow, just wow. Words can't express how bloody wonderful this hotel is. They have nailed everything from the moment you walk into the hotel to the moment you check out. I could go on and on and on, but its not worth it! This is quite simply one of the best hotels I've stayed in.......Accommodation, Location, Design, Staff, food, drinks, spa.......the list just goes on and on. </DOC> Came back for another long weekend (see previous review) as we both loved it to bits. Worth mentioning: - this time the hot tub has seaweed inside it - the early morning yoga class was a must - eat as much of their home made bread as you can get into your mouth (DELICIOUS) - we both personally think the hotel restaurant rivals any of the michelin-starred establishments in the area - rooms are always immaculate - love the soaps from the cornwall soap co (they come in their own cute little bag) I could live in this hotel. See you soon! </DOC> Popped in to the scarlet for lunch when on hols in the area, good food despite nobody in the hotel receiving guests either in the hotel or the restaurant with guests wandering around being ignored. Amazing views this hotel has a fantastic position the outside pool is incredible. Lots of lovely places to sit and admire the view. Stunning design and decor but lacking in any local ambiance or character which is a real shame being in such a great location that the hotel feels like its been plonked from london on a cliff top. At fifteen they manage to bring some local vibe and atmosphere into the restaurant. Not sure I would want to stay there but would go for lunch again. </DOC> This is a truly outstanding hotel in a wonderful location with excellent service and very good food. Perhaps I haven't had the advantages of trip a and I haven't visited Borgo Santo something in Tuscany but I was very pleased with my stay here and I fully intend to return as soon as possible. We had a very short wait at reception and it was very pleasant to have someone take charge of the luggage and show us round the hotel before going to the room. We had one of the smaller cheaper rooms but it had a wonderful view and I enjoyed watching the sun going down into the sea in the restaurant. The breakfast was excellent and cooked to order. As I said before I am looking forward to the next visit. </DOC> This is the future for hotels! Eco-minded (properly), beautifully designed, contemporary and with great staff (in most cases). Rooms are gorgeous - the view across the beach is stunning and everything is lovely quality. Super-comfy beds! The bar staff were friendly but not wholly attentive. Food good in the restaurant and we liked the overall flexibility of the place. I particularly loved the swimming lake - freezing particularly on a blustery day, but so energising. The spa, however, was not good value and was rather disappointing. We paid alot for the spa package but we would have been better booking individual treatments. There was alot of hanging around! The cocoon hammocks, however, were heavenly. Id certainly recommend with the caveat of the spa. </DOC> No need to go abroad, all expectations exceeded on my October visit to this amazing UK hotel. Absolutely everything was perfect and I cannot wait to return. The team and the facilities are perfect in every way, you only have to check all the other reviews! So relaxed, indoor and outdoor pools, beach and great food. </DOC> my husband and myself went to the scarlet hotel for lunch recently and I have to say it was beautiful. three courses for \xc2\xa322.50 lovely good choices and for a lunch time nothing to heavy.the wine is very expensive but very nice our bottle was\xc2\xa338 . the setting makes it all worth while and I cannot comment about the staff enough very helpful ,happy people ,not snotty at all and not that kind of place where the staff thinks they are better than the customers for working there which I do find in a lot of places .they are closed January but after that re open give it a try and see for yourselfs hopefully you will not be disappointed"

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"The glass of port on arrival told us that we were in a very welcoming friendly place. Even though the property is quite old it is very well maintained and very clean. The bathroom in our room was very compact-but functional. Our room was well heated and the bed was very comfortable with separate electric blankets on either side. The highlights for us-apart from being in Bowral- were the meals in the Vida restaurant...the dinner and breakfasts were excellent. </DOC> We had a very enjoyable weekend here at really nice boutique style accommodation. The host Robert, is very welcoming and friendly, with the port on arrival a nice touch. The grounds are well maintained, the rooms are clean and quiet but probably the highlight was the quality of the breakfast which is included in the price. All the staff were great. The rooms were a little on the small side but this did not impact on our enjoyable. Very pleasant place to stay. </DOC> I stayed there for 2 nights recently. I was staying in the Links Suite which is supposed to be their best room. While it was clean and spacious, the bathroom was very basic and tired. In fact the bathroom was not cleaned after the first evening. The front gardens are tidy the back were not well kept. The restaurant was nice. I felt that it was expensive for what it was and as such may not return when I next head to Bowral. </DOC> From check in to check out this was a great stay. Michael at the front desk deserves a rating in his own right, the breakfast was worth the stay and overall this was a pleasant night away. The rooms are small as are the bathrooms but if you read the reviews you'll know that. Comfort is there in bounds as is character. Was it quiet? Yes it was and all the other guests respected that. If you're used to Best Western then you won't like it here but if you like B&B style homes then you will love this. Just make sure you get a glass of port, it is a good one. </DOC> Second time we have stayed here, last being about 18 months ago. Some slight changes since then with new management. slightly higher charges and no offer of a complimentary sherry on arrival. The included breakfast was also of a lesser standard. Despite that, we would consider staying here again. The rooms are spacious enough for a short stay and include a mini bar. Unlike motels and most hotels there is also a very comfortable lounge area with an open fire and a large range of books and dvd's if you wish to look at a movie in your room. For golfers, it is directly opposite the Bowral Golf Course. </DOC> We stayed the weekend with our 2 young children, we just loved the links. The staff were fantastic, the arrival port was welcome to offset frayed nerves from the car trip. The rooms were fairly small and the bathroom even smaller but they were clean and tidy and did what we wanted them to do. My only comment is that the walls are quite thin so noise does travel but that in no means detracted from our stay. The lounge is just lovely with a massive array of videos which was helpful. The included breakfast was fantastic and every request was meet by a lovely smile and a courteous of course. The gardens could possibly do with a bit of a tidy but that is being a bit fussy. Overall we enjoyed ourselves immensely and will be back. Special thanks to Robert for making our stay so enjoyable. </DOC> Stayed 2 nights in mid-winter. Rooms are nicely split into a bed and lounge area. They are quiet, comfortable, very well heated, and reasonably well-equipped. Small but modern ensuite. Staff were excellent - knowledgeable, efficient and very friendly. An excellent breakfast service. Lovely lounge areas with cosy ambience and great views. Good free Wi-Fi. Good value for money. </DOC> If you want a stay on the quiet side that won't break the bank, stay here. This is much nicer than a motel and perfect if you don't want to splurge at Milton park. (or save the money to go there for lunch/dinner as we did). Links House is quaint and atmospheric. Staff were super friendly and helpful. The bathrooms were a tad small, however given the year the hotel was built, that's not at all a surprise. One tip: We didn't realize that the restaurant was only open a few days a week. We arrived after a long trip and were looking forward to not having to go out. The staff were very helpful and told us where we could buy some cheese and wine, and gave us cutlery and plates to take to our room."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"You are always greeted by their friendly staff which is a nice first impression. Rooms are clean, complementary buffet is adequate and location is central to all of Johnstown. No issues here at all but I would recommend more machines or options in the work our area. Plenty of parking and side door entrances make it so most parking spots are good. </DOC> Very clean rooms and friendly helpful staff. Fitness center is adequate and breakfast is good though not healthy. Location is about 4 minutes drive from the school. We stayed using points however prices looked fair considering the area. </DOC> Hampton Inns are our preference and this one did not let us down. From the check in to the breakfast wait staff everything was fine. Our room was clean and quiet, and had all the features that a Hampton Inn provides. It was convenient to what we wanted to see and I would surely go back there again </DOC> My wife & I stayed on a Friday night. Room was clean and comfortable. Hot water was almost immediate (no waiting). Breakfast was standard Hampton fare (all good). Odd numbered rooms face the highway, but also have a view toward the valley. </DOC> This Hampton Inn was excellent. Staff was friendly and helpful, and room clean and comfortable. Bathroom vanity countertop was small. The bed was super comfortable, and the room was quiet. Breakfast was standard Hampton fare. Definitely recommended. I would stay here again if in Johnstown on business. </DOC> Five night business stay in one of the whirlpool rooms. Very clean hotel, good condition and for the location, surprised by an outdoor pool. The pool was a great place to sit and relax at the end of the day. Breakfast was the usual that you find at a Hampton with the added bonus of great staff. The staff were friendly and helpful throughout the stay, from the front desk to housekeeping. They helped with directions, restaurant recommendations. The price seemed a little high for the area but appeared to be worth it compared to other properties in the area. The hotel is up the hill from the shopping center and can be a little difficult to locate if your GPS is not up to date. </DOC> Highs: Large clean room and bathroom Plenty of towels Close to restaurants and shopping Quiet Chocolate chip cookies at the front desk Lows: What happened to the breakfast buffet? They installed a wafflemaker, but took away the cooked eggs, bacon, etc. What happened to the complimentary bottle of water and chips/cookies for HH members? No on-site fitness room Still better than the Holiday Inn, but next time I'm giving the Comfort Inn a try. </DOC> Staff was very nice ! Rm. 114 was clean, quiet and comfortable with nice size refrigerator and a microwave. Nicely kept little gym with 2 tread mills, elliptical and free weights. Outdoor pool. I rate the breakfast better then average because the area was big and clean, the staff was very friendly & they offered ham 1 day & turkey links the next along with the typical other hotel breakfast items. Free coffee & cookies at the lobby in the afternoon/evenings. Bottled water in the mornings. Good location with food options & shopping near by."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"The hotel is typical of all hampton inns. It is a small drive from I 80 to get to the hotel, and there is not a big variety of restaurants close by. But we did go to the one recomented by the hotel and it was very good. I would stay again. </DOC> I have stayed at both major brand hotels in Grove City over the last 6 months. This Hampton certainly gives the other brand a run for its money. Clean rooms, mostly quiet hallways, and a great breakfast line up make this Hampton a good value. I will be staying here again. </DOC> I would stay here again. Friendly staff, clean room, good location. If you need a place to sleep - stay here. Close to shopping, easy access to highways. Free hot breakfast and close to gas stations and McD's if desired. </DOC> Had a meeting here the other day and the staff was very accommodating. The facilities were very nice, hotel was clean, and the meeting planner (Tina) went out of her way to make me happy. She stayed in frequent contact and really made our experience very nice. I will use this hotel again! </DOC> I stayed here for 2 nights whilst visiting SRU. The staff were friendly, polite, and the room was a good size. I liked the fact that there was a fridge and microwave in the room as well. Clean, good location, and vast array of breakfast items including some amazing scones. WiFi worked well too. I would certainly stay there again when I next visit the university. </DOC> Stayed one night after a long days driving. At check-in they didn't acknowledge by hhonors gold status but I didn't bring it up. Rooms were clean although I agree the walls were a little thin. Bedding was clean and bathroom was good. Room had a fridge. Front-desk had a bottle opener for my beer (they've applied for a liquor license but not sure how that will work). Hot-tub was out of order and pool was good although my son said it had too much chlorine. Breakfast was typical for a Hampton. They had a hot egg/ham/hash option that didn't look very appetizing so I didn't try it. Location is just off the interstate and there are lots of other hotels surrounding it. Wi-Fi worked in the evening but was down in the morning. </DOC> Good choice between Erie and Pittsburgh. -- other than outlets -- not much to do -- although recommend a visit to Wendell August forge and store just down the road!! Good breakfast served -- clean room -- room was not very soundproof -- one night was noisy -- one night was quiet!! Staff very friendly!! Carts available to get luggage to room! </DOC> A pleasant hotel right just a little ways off I80. Our room was large, clean, and quiet, with a comfortable bed. The woman behind the desk at check-in was efficient and very friendly. Definitely recommended!"

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"Great staff! My room was like a sauna! I called which I hate to do and they sent engineering up. He said it should cool down within an hour. I was working and my face was red hot. It had not. I went downstairs to get a drink and ask the front desk about it. She felt my face and moved me to another room ASAP. I truly didn't know how hot my room was until I moved and the new one was so cool! Thank you Lillian! Great room service.......everyone was friendly and I like that in a team that works well together! I applaud you all! </DOC> We stayed here during the holidays visiting family. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was inexpensive and we were upgraded to a suite as Platinum members. There are some dated items like the carpet but other upgrades like robes and nice furniture. On the 19th floor we had a nice view of Mount Washington We walked to places downtown. </DOC> We had tickets to a Penguin's game and generally look for Marriott's if available. City center is a good choice in terms of location and overall appeal although it need some updates to the exterior and hallways. Rooms are nice but areas are starting to see some wear and tear. Staff was excellent from front deck to valet's and it's always nice to have a Starbucks in the lobby if you're a coffee drinker. </DOC> Although we live not far from Pittsburgh, anytime we come to town for a concert or just to enjoy the city, we stay at this hotel. The rooms are spacious, comfortable and clean. The service here is great, from the valet to the doorman to the front desk staff and housekeeping. They are currently renovating the lobby. The bar and restaurant in the lobby are still open. I love that there is a Starbucks in the main building lobby. Plenty of garage parking if you choose not to do valet, which is a plus if you come in the winter months. Close to mass transit. </DOC> Nice place to stay. Every single person I ran into was so nice. Everyone went out of there way to make sure my stay was so great. The lobby looks new. The room was very clean. Its right downtown so you close to everything. I will be back. Marriott is always a good choice </DOC> Nice big city hotel on a hill. Could see the train station out our window. Courteous staff, but indoor parking was $12. The street looked a little chancy. Room was large and comfortable. Had trouble getting good wifi signal. Bargain for under a hundred bucks on Priceline. Good walking city. </DOC> In town for the US Open it was a bit noisy the night the Penguins won the cup but it was a comfortable room with quick room service. The only negative was I had waived room service for the first day and the maid service never showed up all week- i had to call to get them to clean. </DOC> I stayed here a year and a half ago and was not impressed, but last weekend I returned and some renovations had made a big different. The rooms are updated and brighter. Little touches like bedside reading lamps and more outlets make a difference. I could still hear hallway noise, and the lobby looks the same, but just about every part of my experience had improved. I ordered room service twice and both times it was very fast and the food was good. I had the salmon with grilled veggies once and it was a good meal. The one consistent bummer was the elevators took a long time. When given a choice in Pittsburgh I chose the Westin, but I can again book the Marriott and feel good about it. The one warning is that with all the construction near the hotel, download new maps into your GPS or be prepared to spend a lot of time lost."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'I had a quick stop in Pittsburgh while attending a rock climbing competition with my daughter. The Fairmont in Pittsburgh is in a great location right downtown. The rooms are very lovely with city views. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was really nice, clean, and spacious. I enjoyed my stay at the Fairmount in Pittsburgh, and I would definitely return! </DOC> Andy\'s Wine Bar after dinner at the Habitat is a cool place to chill. The staff is awesome and will assist you with your every request. Offering great recommendation based on your expressed interest. Not to mention the appetizers and drinking are tasty. The vibe at the bar is lively and friendly. It is a great scene. </DOC> The Fairmont is the best hotel I\'ve stayed at in downtown Pittsburgh. The location is fantastic, near shopping, theater, PNC Park, restaurants and Market Square. Our room had a great view of the ballpark. We were part of a group meeting. The food was delicious with impeccable service. The staff handled the large group efficiently and the quality of the food was above expectations for a banquet type meal. Room service breakfast was delivered right on time and my eggs were still hot. The room and bathroom were generously sized for a downtown hotel. Staff was very pleasant. The only downside was dog hair on the sofa in the lobby so be careful if you\'re wearing black. There is a gentle, friendly hotel dog (yellow lab) that apparently likes to sit on the sofa just like my dogs at home! </DOC> As a Fairmont President\'s Club Member I try to stay at their properties whenever available. The particular Fairmont is stellar. The location is great, the staff professional, informative and very willing to "go the extra mile". There is not a bad view in the hotel-rooms are spacious, with up to date flat screens, ipod docking stations, ultra clean bathrooms with great rain showers and large bathtubs. The restaurant Andy\'s is fabulous incorporating "farm to table" local food etc. The museums, shopping and "the strip" as well as sporting stadiums are all near by. The only place to stay while visiting Pittsburgh-for business or pleasure. If you join the "free Presidents Club it will entitle you to many perks-including free internet room upgrades half price nights free in room exercise kits etc-well worth it. </DOC> I was thrilled to try the new Fairmont Pittsburgh. Beautiful building, centrally located. A wonderful, huge gym. I love that you can get clothing there to workout. Wish I knew this before I packed my workout clothing. Wish I had time to try the spa. Rooms were a great size. Great bathroom toiletries. </DOC> Hotel is located right at market square in the city center. Modern hotel with excellent service. A Spotless and clean facilty. The gym is world class for a hotel. Highly recommend this location for you next trip to the Steel city... </DOC> The Fairmont was a beautiful hotel; fits right in with the surrounding area glass & chrome-like look and feel. Could be used for a sci-fi set! Service was excellent: friendly, attentive and made me feel as if I was the most important guest at that moment. I would easily stay here again and recommend to others. </DOC> The hotel is well located in the city with an attractive lobby. However, the guest rooms and bathrooms are not representative of a 5-star hotel. They are similar to what you would find at a Hilton or Marriott. The room service menu is limited and the lounge might as well be an airport hotel bar. No food service after midnight on a Saturday. Service was excellent and while it may be the best hotel in Pittsburgh, it\'s a generic version of a luxury hotel.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'Convenient to Villanova University. Staff was polite and efficient and the price is reasonable. However, the halls and rooms are in need of updating. Some of the furniture looks somewhat updated but quite worn. The carpeting was worn and stained and the bathroom could use a refresh too. Our bedsheets were a little frayed and had a stain, and there were some crumbs on the floor. I saw the manager\'s comment that the hotel intends to redo the lobby first, but I actually thought the lobby was pretty nice - it\'s the rooms (or at least ours) and housekeeping that need the attention. The bistro setup by the lobby is also quite nice for a quick morning breakfast. </DOC> I recently stayed here 1 night for business travel. Very courteous checkin experience sets the right tone. I also received a free room upgrade as a Marriott Rewards member. I checked in very late, and it was the last room they had saved for me. They could have easily saved a regular room, but they kept the suite saved instead. This is great customer service. Very clean. Actually has a courtyard! And a nice indoor pool area that I did not have time to use, unfortunately. Room was quite large and comfortable. No problems with comfort or access to the internet. The room had large windows and a balcony. I had no issues at all at this hotel. I would stay here again for business or pleasure. </DOC> As a frequent business traveler (great than 6 months a year) , I look for comfort and consistency when selecting a repeat hotel option. The staff at this Marriott Courtyard provides a welcoming atmosphere and the rooms are comfy. A Whole Foods is across the street which is key! </DOC> This is a nice place, off the main road and convenient to Villanova and 476. I make one major suggestion: Do NOT charge for coffee in the morning. Hardly any hotels still do this. Our stay was good. Beds comfortable and room was quiet. </DOC> At least I got my points from Marriott! It\xe2\x80\x99s plain Jane hotel, nothing fancy. Staff is nice and not difficult to get too. Good restaurants in the area. It seems very dated and old looking but our room was clean. </DOC> Nice Quiet Marriott. Room was very nice and VERY dark which is what I like when I stay somewhere. Close to restaurants in the area. We ate at Bertucci\'s. Since we had been out birdwatching all day, we enjoyed the casual dining. Did not eat breakfast there as the cost was as much as we found at a nearby diner, Minellas, which we enjoyed very much. Free WIFI was another welcome amenity as well. Checked out the fitness and pool area and both looked fine but I didn\'t use. </DOC> I used points to stay at this hotel, because it would\'ve been too expensive to actually pay for it.. This hotel is clean, and fairly modern, but, is clearly built for the business person, and not the leisure traveler. There is a Kmart next door, along with a few restaurants nearby, and the King of Prussia Mall was a short drive away, but the hotel is tucked back within what looks like an office park, along with a bank. My wife and I just couldn\'t get past the whole " stuffy, stale" vibe we felt while staying there. There is a pool, and a bistro/bar area, but we didn\'t use either. At almost $180/night, its not worth it, unless you\'re on business and your company is picking up the tab. </DOC> Nice room, comfortable bed, good pillows, easy temperature control, easy access. There is a breakfast but it is not complementary. Coffee in the room, and downstairs they make Starbucks which is fine. There is a lobby eating area, but no one was using it. You can purchase drinks at night (particularly beer and wine) but it\'s really not a bar set up.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"Stayed here for one night in July. Hotel is close to the highways and makes it easy to get to Newport, the beach areas, and the Block Island ferry. Hotel itself is very clean with huge rooms, comfortable beds, and a decent free breakfast. There is a pool and gym which both appeared to be pretty small. This place appears to be a business hotel although I was told by one of the employees there are a good amount of kids on the weekends. I will definitely be back on my next Rhode Island trip. </DOC> While the entire property is not completely updated (hallways), the rooms are modern and comfortable. It is well maintained and clean. I tried a couple other Comfort and Hampton Inn properties in the Greater Providence area, and this one was the best. </DOC> It was clean rooms were nice but I just felt it was over priced. I stay at this chain of hotels a lot and this was the most expensive comfort I've stayed in it wasn't anything special. The Hampton up the street was cheaper I found out after the fact by 30.00 and they have nicer beds and comparable breakfast. </DOC> Located just off of I-95 on the far southern edge of the Providence urban area. Hotel is a little isolated as far as walking anywhere, but any food or shopping you want is less than 5 minutes drive away. Hotel looks very nice as you approach at night. Checked in quickly by friendly desk clerk, given my choice of cold drink and snack for being a Choice Privileges member. Asked for 4th floor room, assigned 3rd floor. My King Suite was large, clean, comfortable, and very quiet through the night. Looked and felt like a $200 room. Slept great and had a good breakfast in the morning. My one and only complaint - the shower water temperature was nice and hot for a few minutes then started oscillating between scalding and freezing. Otherwise, I really enjoyed my stay here and do plan on returning. </DOC> A very comfortable - pun intended - two night stay. All of the staff are excellent, especially Maria in the breakfast room. She takes great pride in her work. Everywhere is spotlessly clean, as if the hotel only opened yesterday. It is a credit to management and staff. Wifi was excellent. Breakfast was very good. The hot food was different each morning. Our room was great. Great sleep quality in a very comfortable bed. Bathroom was spotless. Chocolate chip cookies on arrival and a takeaway bag with water, fruit and a bar on departure were nice extra touches. Highly recommended - we would definitely return and I will check out the brand for future trips. Though I doubt any will match the West Warwick one! </DOC> Up to the best of Comfort Inn standards. Good breakfast and free WiFi. Comfortable clean beds and rooms. Pleasant staff. Location is in an office park, so it's pretty quiet, but you will have to drive for restaurants or anything else. Close to Interstate and not far from Providence--took us less than 15 min to get to Roger Williams Park for the zoo and it was extremely close to family (that part was lucky) as this was a family visit too. Would be happy to stay here again if our travels bring up back to Providence. </DOC> We were looking for a resonably priced hotel near Newport after the Newport Jazz Festival and we found it! After experiencing the wonderful but crowded jazz fest, it was nice to get outside of town and stay in a quiet area. Spacious rooms, very clean, quiet, comfortable. Friendly service and good breakfast. There are several good restaurants nearby and a large movie theater complex. It is right off of the highway and it was a fairly easy drive back into Newport. </DOC> We spent four nights here recently and were very happy with the standard of the hotel. The rooms are large & well appointed, the free Wi-Fi is quick (although unsecured), the free parking is plentiful. A complimentary breakfast is available in the mornings with very accommodating staff. The coin laundry is very handy & the heated pool is great. Just slightly out of town, the hotel's situation makes it very quiet - there is also a large open area outside for children to play (supervised by parents) - we also found lots of ducks & geese here."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'The room was very clean, comfortable beds, clean bathroom, the front desk staff was very helpful in suggesting places to go and to eat out. I would stay here again. The location was perfect to go downtown to the Historic downtown, harbour location. It was only 6 minutes away, also free parking, which would save alot of money. </DOC> We choose this hotel because we did not want to pay the rates that you do when staying in the historic area. We found the hotel to be very nice and we would do it again. It was about 10 minutes away and an easy drive. </DOC> This hotel is like all Holiday Inn Expresses, clean comfortable and reliable. The staff at this one is superb. The first floor did smell of tobacco even though the signs on all the rooms say no smoking. There is a grocery store across the street and a few restaurants in the area. It is a little far from downtown. For a night it is fine. </DOC> We stayed here in May for seven nights. The hotel suited us very well. A little way from Charleston and therefore more reasonable than a city centre hotel. The rooms were clean and comfortable, the Staff were very friendly and we enjoyed sitting by the pool after a busy day sightseeing. It was our first visit to Charleston and we loved it so much that another trip is planned. We will very likely stay at this hotel again. </DOC> Finding a toe or finger nail on the carpet...yuck. A hair on the toilet....double yuck. So they have to work on that. But as far as HI Express goes in general...this was a nice one. Breakfast was good too...the area too small but good. The TVs didn\'t work well...they told me to take the plug out and back in. But it was a nice place, easy to find, and near food. They need a "store" like the Fairfield, Courtyard do...they just have a vending machine. </DOC> Great stay - very comfortable beds, good quiet location (short drive from downtown and great restaurants nearby), nice breakfast selection. Can\'t think of anything bad to say about this hotel! Staff were helpful too, and although we didn\'t use the pool it looked very nice and clean. Tea, coffee and cookies always available. </DOC> Nice and quite, no real food places near, have to drive. Arrived at breakfast at 8:30 am - out of eggs. How does that happen? Plan better when you order! Hotel is upgraded, however they left a few of the old items in the bathroom. Used the old shower outlet and ecussion cover. Why? That is a $6 part. Left the old toilet cut off valve as well. </DOC> After staying at dirty hotels with no or little maintenance, this review is a pleasure to write. This Holiday Inn Express was the best hotel on our multi-state driving trip. It is really wonderful. The appearance is A+. Everything is so clean. The rooms are nice. The superb breakfast includes scrambled eggs (really!) and hot biscuits. The staff is very friendly. This hotel shows that nice hotels are possible and don\'t have to cost a fortune. Highly recommended.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"I feel very lucky to have stumbled upon the Inn for my recent trip. The facilities were extremely clean and comfortable, the staff friendly, and the complimentary breakfast one of the the best I have seen. The location was also extremely convenient for me, with lots of dining options nearby and beautiful areas to walk or jog on campus. I will definitely stay here again when in the area! </DOC> Nice hotel on USC's campus. Beds are firm. Room was clean. Hot breakfast is superior to most hotels with a waffle station and omelet station. Staff are very helpful. The old mansion that is the lobby is beautiful with a mission style interior especially the woodwork. </DOC> I am an alumni of the university and I am very pleased to stay there . The place is very clean and well managed , its elegant and classy . I used to stay in the same street when I was a student there and I am surprised to see how well kept and maintained the building is . If you have business to conduct with USC , this will be your best hotel to stay , if you are an alumni like me , you must stay in this hotel as it is so convenient that you feel like you are student again in the center of the beautiful campus. I will stay there again next time I visit my alma mater </DOC> Was at a conference which is why I was here - not sure I would go to Columbia otherwise. The area around the university is very nice but if you stray too far Columbia would not be my first choice location! However, the hotel itself was fine - good sized room and the facilites were perfectly adequate. My only criticisms would be: (i) there was nothing between the bottom sheet and the mattress - better hotels always put something in-between for hygiene and comfort reasons (ii) the breakfast room was a bit basic - it felt as if it should have been part of the university rather than the hotel. Outside the hotel, the Blue Marlin is recommended as a place to eat. We were warned by the conference organisers to take care at night in Columbia if not in a group. </DOC> The staff is terrific. The location is perfect for visiting the campus. The rooms are generous in size. What is a shame is the quality of the sheets and towels. Very Poorly chosen and need to be replaced. Breakfasts are fine, served in a dining room like you were on campus. All in all we chose for its location and for that it works </DOC> Due to the building and setting on the university, this seems like a B&B. The public areas reinforce this with lovely wood floors and antique furniture. The rooms have modern conveniences and my favorite--fridge and MW in each room. Public areas are great for ad hoc business meetings and the 24 hour beverages (coffee, hot and cold tea, lemondage) are a thoughtful and refreshing touch. Free parking and nice area to get out and walk around. </DOC> First the good. The front desk staff and shuttle driver are incredibly friendly and helpful. Good job! However, that's where it ends. My room was not clean. There was only one small trash basket in the bathroom and it was not emptied (I stayed two nights). There were hairs and other evidence of past guests in the room and bathroom, and incredibly two of the three lights in the bathroom were out. Don't you think someone would notice and change them? The toilet took more than ten minutes to fill to flush again. Also, the staff in the breakfast area were there to talk to each other and seemed bothered by the guests coming in. Overall, a huge disappointment for such a charming-looking hotel in an ideal location. Please, someone tell your staff to appreciate your guests more. </DOC> We almost drove right by the hotel, as it blends in with the neighborhood. It is a brick building with a nice front porch with rocking chairs. The lobby, and sitting areas are very nice. They offer hot and drinks near the front desk. The staff was helpful and friendly. The room was nice, beds were comfortable. There was some stains on the carpet, and the furniture was a little worn. The room had a microwave and fridge. The bathroom was small, and the exhaust vent was clogged with lint/dust, so that did not work. Breakfast is included. They offered made to order eggs, and waffles, along with other hot and cold choices. Fresh fruit, baked goods, yogurt, and a few different juices, coffee, and tea. Great choice when visiting USC."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"The chain has done a good job updating the lounge area and bar which looks nice. Location is good being near the mall and plenty of dining options. The rooms seem a bit dated but no complaints. If you are picky about your accommodations you may want to pay more for another Marriott that's closer to dtown Greenville. </DOC> Friendly and courteous staff. Rooms are clean but small and needs updating. The bottom fitted sheet did not fit well and kept coming off during the night. The.elevator. was slow and squeeky. The mall was xlose but not within walking distance. </DOC> Stayed here on points this past weekend while visiting friends in Greenville. It is an older property but well maintained and a good staff. The location is fine and puts you in Greenville and a short drive to the airport, downtown and Woodruff Road shopping and restaurant area. </DOC> We recently spent one night at this hotel. It has been been remodeled in the last couple of years. The rooms were like all other Courtyards, but it was very clean. The mattress was very soft, I do prefer a harder mattress. The staff was nice and friendly. It seemed to be in an older part of Greenville, but not that far from newer restaurants and shopping centers. It is very close to the Haywood Mall. We would stay here again. </DOC> Lobby is beautiful and service is great! However there is a lot of construction going on. Fans are running through the night too so bring earplugs. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily appreciate being woke up by staff discussing things in the hallway but I understand the construction. Hope y\xe2\x80\x99all can finish soon. </DOC> Hotel is in good location off I-385. You do not hear noise from interstate. Property seems like a renovated Residence Inn location - 2 long wings of rooms around a center courtyard. Room was clean if not a little small. Elevators in both wings very, very slow. Also, not enough car parking on our second night. Customer service was good. </DOC> I didn't see anything that made me think the room hadn't been cleaned, but the hotel could certainly use a spruce. It is showing its age. The staff were nice, but overall this is not a stellar Courtyard experience. </DOC> With room to spare. Very nice, comfortable bed, clean throughout. The staff was also very courteous and made me feel right at home. Overall a very pleasant stay. I would definitely consider staying here again if I get back to the Greenville area."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'Fairly new and yet they are upgrading it again. Nice to see a modern well maintained Courtyard as so many have become tired. Have stayed here a couple of times now and will do so again. Food decent but many restaurants nearby. Rooms nice. Lobby area very nice. Typical slow Courtyard elevators the only complaint. Keep it up! </DOC> This was my third visit to this Courtyard in Mt. Pleasant, SC. I think we had the smallest and worst room on the property but it was just fine. We had originally booked at the Residence Inn, a sister property, about a mile down the road but were notified that they were overbooked and if OK, they would switch us to Courtyard to include breakfast at no additional charge. Perfect. The hotel is very nice, lots of parking, friendly and efficient service and nicely located to shopping & dining... the beach is a few miles away. Happy Hour at the bar included wings and spinach dip with tortilla chips. The breakfast buffet was very nice and had everything to "eggs your way", fresh fruit, waffles, and such. I\'m certain that we will be back for another visit! </DOC> Spent three nights here and it was home away from home. the front staff could not have been more friendly or helpful. the room was roomy and quite. The AC worked well. there is a small exercise room. there is a pool and hot tub and outdoor sitting area. There are spaciously rooms off the lobby for relaxing, reading, watching TV or having a coffee/breakfast. Easy to get to the highway and located right on route 17 that will take you downtown in about 15 minutes tops. Also in the other direction is the famous sweetgrass basket highway with several shacks along the roadway where you can see woman weaving their basket, and displaying them for sale. pay about 1/3 less than the initial offering. </DOC> We stayed two nights and enjoyed the hotel itself. The decor of the public areas is very nice, with many local touches, and the staff was professional and friendly. But I don\'t see a reason to pay premium price for this far-out a location. My cost was nearly $475 all in for a standard room booked months in advance with AAA and Marriott memberships. I had been to Charleston previously but not to the Mt Pleasant area and didn\'t study the geography carefully enough, this is pretty far out even within Mt Pleasant. So in the end despite a positive overall experience I will look elsewhere on my next trip to the area. </DOC> Easy to get to from the airport, kind of tricky to get to the actual parking lot once there. It was a very clean hotel. They were updating some of the hallways when we were there. The rooms are clean and well appointed. The desk has multiple outlets for charging your tablets, phones etc. It also has a connection to the television so you can connect your devices to the television. The pool was small but serviceable. The kids liked playing in the pool. They have breakfast but it is not free. There are few restaurants for breakfast in the area. There are a few good local restaurants close by for lunch and dinner. The staff was polite, friendly and professional. </DOC> Most all Courtyard Marriotts are very similar. The difference are the employees. I have stayed 98 nights this year in one of the many! I was pleasantly surprised at the atmosphere of the hotel. From the front desk to the house keepers everyone was great. This is one of the few Courtyards that have a bistro and ba and separate bar. It is a great hotel for a family. However very quiet for the business traveler. Oh, you must have a drink at the bar with Tony! He is great! </DOC> Stayed here one night before setting sail for a Carnival Cruise. Awesome location, within a short drive to Charleston. Alot of restaurants and shops within a short drive which was a huge plus. Rooms were amazing, great color schemes. Check in process was quick and easy and the staff was very friendly/professional. Highly recommend this hotel if you are staying in the area. </DOC> I have expectations staying at Marriott. This hotel did not disappoint. As a gold member, I received an upgrade. Since we were there the night before a cruise, we needed late checkout for an hour as we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t board the ship until noon. We extended checkout an hour which was convenient for us and our group. The evening we stayed was a cool 60 degrees & our group enjoyed meeting and sitting around the fire pit. I would recommend and stay at Mt. Pleasant Courtyard again.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"This is a typical Hampton Inn, nothing more, nothing less. Upon check-in, the front desk employee was counting their drawer, I guess it was a shift change. Stood there for a few minutes, while they did this. Would have been nice just to be acknowledged, but I guess they didn't want to lose count. Parking area is kind of small and a little harder finding spaces late at night. Staff was friendly. Being a diamond/gold member for the past 12 years, I was not overly impressed but you'll get the reliable standard that you get from most Hampton Inns. I would stay here again. </DOC> We chose this hotel because it was a reasonable price and becasue it had easy access to downtown Charleston, Mount Pleasant and everywhere else we wanted to visit. The room was large with big comfy beds and quiet. Breakfast were OK, nothing special. Staff very friendly and helpful. </DOC> I stayed at the Hampton Inn & Suites as part of a group package. Check-in was a bit harried for the clerk, as several others arrived about the same time, but he was efficient, if not distracted. The room was spacious and well-appointed. It was also clean and quite. The complimentary breakfast was actually good. Nice place. </DOC> Facility is fairly new and very attractive. It was nice and quiet. Our only complaint is that it was not near anything. We had to drive about 5 miles to get to a grocery store or find a selection of restaurants. Staff did not seem to have a good idea of what grocery stores were nearby. It was about 20-30 minutes from downtown. </DOC> Another fantastic Hampton Inn which exceeded our expectations. What a beautiful property in all respects. Courteous and efficient employees throughout the facility. Our room was perfect, including a personalized welcome letter from the general manager. It is clear that the staff and management here have a goal of exceeding guest expectations. I would definitely stay here again and definitely recommend it to others. The internet service was reliable and free. The breakfast was great, served by a very courteous hostess. </DOC> We really enjoyed staying here. Was peaceful. Relaxing. And we were able to walk to Starbucks which was just across the street! There were so many little fast food places & a fantastic bbq place walking distance. Lovely sitting area just off the lobby. Thank you for a lovely stay! </DOC> Stayed 1 night on business trip to Summerville. The location worked well. It is close to the airport and a short distance off the Interstate. WIFI works and the room is quiet. The place is in very good condition. They have a nice size fitness room. The staff is friendly. The surrounding area is almost exclusively fast food places, so if you want a sit down meal you will have to drive into Goose Creek area. </DOC> Stayed here for 5 nights for a family vacation. Hotel staff is absolutely amazing! Very friendly and helpful. The hotel is super clean also. Location wise we were 25 minutes from downtown and 25 minutes from the beaches. This hotel is down the street from the mall if you want to shop. Nice pool on property too. Breakfast was good every morning. Highly recommend this hotel."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"1 night using highway coupon to save$10. Very clean and comfy. You won't find a flat screen but you will find free breakfast and free wifi and a nice clean comfortable room. Check in by I believe a fellow John was seamless. He could run a Hyatt he answered all questions efficiently leaving nothing to ask. I've been in travel for almost 40 years. He was very bright. They have a small pool and restaurants nearby ( minutes away) good pit stop on a road trip. Pet friendly as well. </DOC> This was our first stay in a Microtel. Our room was small but efficient. The bed was solid and sheets clean. Towels were thin but plentiful. Breakfast was OK... bread, cereal, waffles, yogurt, juice and a few hot items. Our room looked over the back of the property, which was pleasant. This is a pet friendly property with good outside space to walk dogs. There is a nonrefundable fee for pets, so call to confirm details. We did not have a pet but I witnessed an altercation between a confused and angry pet owner and management. So do your homework if you have pets. We stayed for under $80. That is about the value here. I would not pay much more. Not a luxury experience but certainly not low end experience either. </DOC> We picked the Microtel from the Hotel Coupon book based on the $54 nightly rate. It is just off the Interstate and the check-in process was seamless and efficient. The room was clean and had everything that we required. The WIFI signal was inconsistent at time. The morning breakfast was average with minimal selection. </DOC> Recently stayed at this hotel based on prior reviews and close proximity to Hilton Head. The front staff at night and in the morning were friendly. Stayed on the 1st floor. The room had two queen beds which was a plus instead of two doubles. The beds were comfortable and the room was clean. No issue with the WIFI being on the lower floor. The room did not have a fridge, only the suites have them. I would recommend getting a room on the upper floors, since you could hear the people above you in the early morning. The breakfast is simple and basic, slightly more than a continental breakfast. The price is much cheaper than some of the nearby hotels and is located right off the exit near the Cracker Barrel. </DOC> Stopped here for one night. The desk clerk was friendly and efficient. Our room was very large and bathroom were clean. The bed was a bit lumpy but doable for a night. Cable selection was adequate. Wifi worked well and there was ample parking. You could walk to the Cracker Barrel. The only thing we didn't understand was there was a cushion in the window sill and it blocked the air coming from the air conditioner flow. We thought it may have been put there for people traveling with pets??? Loved the vinyl plank flooring that was in the bathroom... It was a good stop. Reasonable price. </DOC> This was a typical budget Microtel. It was clean and spartan but the price was good and the location was good. As usual the breakfast bar was very limited but that is what you can expect when the price is this low. We stayed two nights on a visit to Charleston SC </DOC> Nice folks there, and a good place to stop with the dog back and forth from Florida. Breakfast a bit basic, suggest Ruby Tuesdays rather than the Cracker Barrel across the street. </DOC> We stayed here twice, on our way to Florida and on our way home. Both times we had a comfortable, clean room and were happy with our two stays. The breakfast was fine, the usual selection of cereal, things to toast, waffles, yogurt and fruit. The service at check in and check out was pleasant and efficient. There is a Cracker Barrel across the street which is convenient if you don't feel like getting back into your car again to find a restaurant. There is also a gas station nearby. We would definitely stay here again."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'We made our reservations through Stacy in the spring of 2011 and she kept in touch via email and phone on the status. We had several great rooms and the staff made our stay just wonderful. Every day greated with smiles and after our afternoon riding our room had drink tickets for the bar downstairs as well as an invite to a VIP party. The price is priced for Sturgis rally week so regardless where you stay the price was worth it because we loved the location and the 24 staff watched over the parking lot of motorcyles to make sure they too slept well. Great location, great hotel, great staff, and we are going back!!! </DOC> The location right next to Rapid City\'s main street was a plus. The room was spacious with chairs, bureau, and desk, but the furnishings looked cheap, like Ikea quality. The bed was not great. The hotel has seen a better day, and is a bit overpriced now. However service was friendly and helpful. There was no fan in the bathroom and no safe in the room. The fruit at breakfast was straight out of a can and not even cold. It was nice to have tablecloths and coffee served, but It would be nicer if they also served juice at the table, instead of serve-your-own from a stack of plastic cups at the buffet. Parking was adjacent and easy. </DOC> Quirky rooms/decor may not be to the taste of all but my partner & I loved it! I particularly liked the semi-transparent big sliding blue door to the bathroom...if you closed it and left the light off it became an amazing meditation/cool/quiet zone. I also loved the humour behind the teacup chairs. Great central location very near to the Firehouse Pub/Winebar/Restaurant & Beau Jo\'s Pizza place - both superb for eating & drinking. On a tour of 16 days and about 14 hotels the Adoba stood out - praise indeed! </DOC> I stayed at this property earlier this week. Excellent location for downtown business and shopping. Rooms are fresh, modern, exceptionally clean. Very attentive staff. Perhaps the best of all, the Enigma reasturant might just be the best in Rapid City! Breakfast buffet is outstanding as well, and free for hotel guests. Highly recommend this hotel in Rapid City, and for visitors to Mt. Rushmore and the Black Hills. </DOC> The room was a good size with two queen beds. The bedding was comfortable. The walls were decorated in a map of rapid city and surrounds and Mt Rushmore. This really puts you in the mood to explore. The bathroom was average size. There is free wifi but it is a bit slow. There are adjoining rooms if required. Everything was very clean and tidy. </DOC> Stayed at the Rushmore for 2 nights. Room was clean and the desk service was just OK. The dinning area was very nice. The bar located down store needs a face lift. All in all a good stay but nothing spectacular. </DOC> This hotel is centrally located and on the road to Mt Rushmore. Breakfast was fine and the older woman (Sorry!) who serves was wonderful. In my room the blinds were letting in too much light and were torn. I waited for maintenance... The shower nozzle didn\'t work and the next day it broke: "The people who installed our shower fittings did a poor job." The elevator stopped working for a period of hours. Etc. The hotel has organized an external launderer as the hotel\'s washers need repair????? Fix it!!! The staff were good but as for the hotel itself... </DOC> This is a fine hotel as you would expect from a Radisson. Restaurant is good if a bit pricey. Breakfast is excellent. One minor drawback is that the hotel only has 2 lifts/elevators and as the hotel caters for tour groups, the wait for these can be rather long.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"At the end of a long day driving west, we were pleased to find this to be a comfortable place to spend the night. Friendly staff, good sized rooms and a big, comfortable bed were all we could wish for. </DOC> This is a newer property, and it shows. It is also very clean. Decent size room, nice pool and spa. This being our first visit to a Comfort Inn we did not know what to expect, but we where very happy with our stay here. Only issue for us was the limited breakfast, very basic. And the fact that the location is a bit far from everything, looks like the area is still under development. </DOC> This Comfort Inn & Suites is brand new and located in an area of new hotels, but little else right nearby. The facility is clean and neat and the rooms are very comfortable. Good bed and linens. Excellent breakfast! There are not many shops or restaurants right nearby, but several within a few minutes drive. </DOC> Very friendly and efficient check in staff. Easy access to the interstate. Room was clean and comfortable. Also very quiet. Breakfast was average for this chain. Definitely would recommend this place to stay. </DOC> We spent one night here and had no complaints. The front desk personnel were friendly and the coffee and cookies available in the afternoon were appreciated. We had a king bed suite which was roomy and clean. The bed was comfortable and the room was quiet. Breakfast was typical with usual offerings. Overall a good place to spend the night. </DOC> Clean and new, spacious, and what else can I say positive.....oh yes, nicest bed in some time! Breakfast was very good, and waffles with strawberries were wonderful! I would like to see egg whites or beaters along with lean meats like ham or canadian bacon on the menu, but I haven't seen these on a breakfast bar in some time. </DOC> We stayed here on our return to Florida. This hotel is off of the interstate and just a little ways in - maybe 1/2 mile at most. That meant a quieter night without traffic sounds. It was easy access. The furnishings were newer. Breakfast was fine. Staff was pleasant. I would recommend. </DOC> Stayed here for a night in July 2016. Fairly new property and enjoyed our stay. The beds were comfortable and the rooms clean. The lady at the desk was friendly and accommodating. The price was right and I've paid a lot more for a lesser room in the past. The breakfast was regular hotel fare but good. No problem coming back."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"The Spring Hill Suites by Marriott on the Riverfront Parkway was our family's vacation hotel for 4 days while visiting Chattanooga. The lobby and public area of the hotel is very large and nice. The outside patio is great and has a nice view of the Tennessee River with a large seating area too. The rooms are very modern and comfortable. Hotel staff are very friendly and a special thanks to Katie for her assistance during our stay. Housekeeping staff kept our rooms very clean and that was difficult since we had two young granddaughters with us! The breakfast buffet was excellent and staff kept the food items continually full during the open hours of the buffet. We would definitely stay at this Spring Hill Suites again when visiting Chattanooga! </DOC> This hotel was practically brand new. It still smells new! The decor is very modern and well kept. The staff was wonderful from the front desk clerk to the breakfast attendant. The only very small drawback is the size of the pool but it was a weekend and lots of families were there so it was full. There is a wonderful outdoor courtyard with gas fire pit to be enjoyed. It was nice to sit out at night around the fire pit (yes even in July). </DOC> Stayed at this property overnight while on business in Chattanooga. The rooms are very spacious and well appointed. Breakfast was terrific with many healthy items. The business center boasted two desktop computers, printers, and office supplies (perfect for the business traveler). The gym, while small, had brand new equipment (note - bring your own water bottle. There was only a water fountain, no cups). The location on the river and very near all the riverfront attractions makes this a perfect place for anyone visiting the city. </DOC> I have stayed at this hotel twice now. It is in a great location right on the river but in a less busy part of town adjacent to downtown. The view of the river from the balcony rooms is great, and the balconies are nice with a table and 2 chairs. Rooms are spacious and the showers are great. Nice lobby area. Just a few minutes from awesome restaurants and other downtown attractions. The only issue is that parking not only costs extra, but is fairly limited. If you venture out for a late dinner, you may have trouble finding a space when you get back. </DOC> My family lived in Chattanooga 45 years ago, and we have fond memories of the river, so I wanted a hotel located on the river. Springhill Suites was the perfect choice. I booked a suite for my mom, sister and me. The room was lovely and nicely arranged so we never felt crowded. The hotel is spacious, clean, and has a beautiful patio looking out on the river. Everyone we encountered, including the two young gentlemen who checked us in, were friendly and helpful. The patio is spacious with a nice view of the river. Very relaxing! Automated bike rentals are in front of the hotel. My sister and I took advantage of that and had a nice ride around the city. I definitely recommend this hotel. </DOC> I stayed here for two nights & everything was great! I was really impressed with the service & amenities this facility has. My check-in was a breeze & the lady at the front desk was super nice & answered every question that I had. I had a king studio room & it was great size! It had a small fridge, microwave & some paper plates to warm something up in the microwave. The bathroom was huge & had a glass enclosed walk in shower...very nice! This facility had a very nice outdoor patio where you could sit & look out at the river. They also have a lounge where you could get drinks & take it out on the patio...happy hour is 4-6 each night. The location is perfect & it's a short walk to many restaurants & pub. I would highly recommend this facility if staying in the downtown Chattanooga area! </DOC> Been coming here for years and may be at a point of staying elsewhere. First I will say the staff is always nice and attentive. The property and rooms are in need of a renovation. Carpets are consistently stained and seeing mold in bathrooms now. Most concerning is the mold. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to look elsewhere as there are many Marriott options in town. </DOC> This hotel is right on the water and it is beautiful! I had a room with a balcony and view of the water and skyline....Priceless!Staff was wonderful, professional, and personable. Property was clean and well kept. There is a restaurant attached and it\xe2\x80\x99s ok. Breakfast was standard. This location is also close to different attractions like the aquarium, movie theater, etc... I highly recommend this location. I would definitely return."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'Based on TA reports, we booked three nights at the Hampton Inn Gallatin. It was an older property that has been kept in pretty good condition. One reason that we stay at Hampton Inns is that we like their beds and bedding. We were very disappointed in this one. The sheets on the bed were literally threadbare! Another negative was that they had older telephones that were originally designed to call the front desk, set wake up calls etc, but they didn\'t work. Why wouldn\'t you replace them? The desk lamp wouldn\'t work and the pool wasn\'t clean. All in all we weren\'t very pleased. The lady working the desk in the morning on the weekend was not friendly or helpful at all. Next time we will stay in Hendersonville. </DOC> This was a good place to stay. Pricing was in line with market. Hampton Inns are a known quantity and are usually consistently superior compared with "Choice Hotels" or similar. The only disappointing thing about this one is that there was no indoor pool and hot tub like most of the Hampton Inns. But I suppose that is not their fault if the space doesn\'t allow for it. But it is a decent place. Clean rooms, good breakfast, friendly staff. For the $100-120 price point, it is a good find. </DOC> I spent two night in the Hampton Inn Gallatin. The front desk staff was great very friendly the morning breakfast was okay. One of the better breakfasts I have had at these type hotels. My room was clean and comfortable. A bit dated, was not offered my upgrades based on my HHonors status, but it was noted. The internet was overly slow, personally I have had faster connections in rural Africa (Tanzania). But since this was a family visit, I survived as the choice in Gallatin is not that great. But I found the price to be very expensive for the location and hotel type. But you really do not have a choice. </DOC> The hotels in Nashville were so expensive I decided to stay in Gallatin, which was the better choice. My room had 2 queen beds, a full desk so I could work, a large bathroom with plenty of bath linens, TV and wi-fi. It did not have a fridge or microwave. The outside pool area was very clean and attractive. Everything from the lobby to the room was clean, and the service was very good. It\'s close to restaurants. It\'s close enough to Nashville to see the sites and drive the few minutes to a clean hotel. I will stay here again. </DOC> We wanted a place outside the Nashville area to stay at. I think this Hampton in Gallatin did the trick. It was a nice hotel. We had a clean room with awesome beds. The staff was very nice and helpful. Breakfast was pretty good as well. Great Hampton in Gallatin, Tennessee. </DOC> Very cozy! Loved all the pillows and comforter! We stayed here for 5 nights. Very clean, staff was nice, breakfast was delicious. Nice that you can walk to several restaurants and Wal-Mart. This was our 2nd time staying here, hope to return again. </DOC> I have stayed at this Hampton several times but if you do not book early you might have trouble getting a room. On my last visit there was only one night available so I stayed here and then went to the Hampton in Mt. Juliet which is about half an hour from my job site as opposed to ten minutes. So book early. Overall the stay was very pleasing. </DOC> I stayed while on Business, the location is close to Interstate, etc but the beds are HARD AS A BRICK!! Had a Double room, tried both beds, neither comfortable.Room also smelled of smoke, called desk, they said booked up, so sent someone with can of air freshner...GRRR Felt WORSE when I got up @ 3am than I did before I went to bed. Pilows were ok, room it\'s self was typical Hampton Inn. Hope they replace mattresses before I stay work in the area again, otherwise will be changing hotels.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"Brand New Hotel .. Rooms are very roomy. The Staff is Wonderful!! Go with Ball Family and the Lobby is great for families to hang out. Breakfast was Fresh and choices was plenty. Will be staying here for any more stays in Knoxville. Locations is great too!! </DOC> This is an okay hotel. It is very close to the interstate and is quite loud. The beds are comfortable and the room is clean. The tv kept going out due to rain, not storms just rain. Overall average and not worth the rate. Too many hotels near. Would recommend the courtyard Marriott right down the road. </DOC> We stayed here for 2 nights. The hotel is very convenient to I-40, I-75 exchange, clean, friendly and easy to book. Would definitely recommend and would stay here again. Typical Hampton breakfast with good choices. </DOC> This location opened in April 2015. Very nice landscaping just taking hold. Layout is on hill parallel to freeway, so there is some highway noise on the side next to the freeway, but it is not bad. Being new, it is extremely clean and in great condition. Charge for pet dog was quite high ($40) but there were few choices in this area; when we entered the room, my dog sniff-identified what must have been spots on the carpet, although we smelled absolutely nothing. There is a sign asking you to clean up after pet in the pet walk area, but it is impossible to see anything at night due to very poor lighting there. I would definitely stay here again. </DOC> My family and I attended a family wedding in Knoxville and stayed at this hotel. The room was great, the breakfast delicious, and the staff was helpful. We had a little mix up where our room wasn't cleaned while we were out but after speaking with the manager they were very responsive and went above and beyond to take care of our request. Convenient location to downtown. </DOC> Like many new Hampton Inn and Suites that have been built in the last few years, this on just off I-40 in Knoxville does not disappoint. The large complex is situated on top of a hill and located just down the street from a Whole Foods, mall and numerous restaurants. Rooms are quite well-appointed with new furniture and fixtures. Breakfast room adjacent to lobby is spacious and has extensive offerings (e.g., omelets, sausage, waffles, toast, oatmeal, cereal, bagels, muffins, fruit, etc.). Carpet and tile in common areas is modern and festive. Good value and convenient. </DOC> We stayed here while passing through to Hilton Head. This Hampton is like all the others: immaculately clean, well furnished, lots of amenities, edible breakfast, free wifi, borderline pricing, slow elevators, and a horrifying level of plastic and paper waste during breakfast hours. On the whole, a great hotel with predictably high quality but not a killer value. Beware: Taxes are fairly appalling at more than 17%, adding $21 to our bill. If avoiding a skanky area is important to you, you can have confidence with this hotel. It's in a very nice area, sort of office park-ish, out of the city, right off the interstate. Seemed very secure. Hope this helps. . </DOC> I got to pick which room I would get upon arrival. Which is great I could pick one right at the elevator so I didn't have to carry my stuff far. Staff was great breakfast could have used some chocolate milk but other than that they had lots of food to choose from. Check out was easy, nice property, clean rooms, great location, and easy to get to lots of places nearby. Would stay again if back in the area."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"stayed at this hotel a week after xmas thinking the hotel would be quiet after the holiday period and to our pleasant surprise it was busy which is a good sign of a hotel. As previous reviews all staff were very friendly room was spotless, spacious and comfortable.The en-suite does not have a bath, which didn't bother us but maybe for younger families could be a hindrance. the breakfast the first morning was only ok,Food not very hot a que for the toaster. Second morning made up for it while you still had to que for the toaster we ordered omelettes which were piping hot and very tasty. we visited the pool both days and found it clean and water temp just right however changing rooms are a bit cramped. overall i would stay here again </DOC> I stayed here for one night whilst on a business trip. The check in was friendly and helpful staff to organise taxis etc. The rooms are lovely, modern etc. However there was little atmosphere at the hotel and this was very obvious at a surprisingly poor breakfast. The choice was basic to say the least, the staff elusive and a piece of toast and a cup of tea being the best option is poor. It would suggest and mirror the fact the hotel is in 'limbo' in so much the change of control etc at the beginning of the year. I hope the hotel survives and is able to reanimate/invest in all the details that could make it an ever more pleasant stay. I would definitely go back. </DOC> The second time I have stayed at this hotel and very good again. It is typical Marriott standard, very spacious rooms, comfy beds etc. This time (after having a super meal in the restaurant last time) we ate in the hotel bar and a really fantastic meal was had, the menu did look standard bar fayre but the grub was fantastic, no complaints at all. Health club was good again, only gripe was the temperature of the pool, too cold, I meant to feed that back to the staff but forgot. As long as you are not looking for a picturesque location (the hotel sits beside a roundabout) then this hotel is great as a base for touring round, but also plenty to do if staying in, with the health club, and I made good use of the free wifi !! </DOC> It's not often I'm wowed by a hotel anymore but this one was great. It has a free shuttle to and from DUB about a 15-20 min ride. The check in was fast, efficient and friendly. The bar staff stayed open to accommodate my order even though I arrived at the hotel after closing time. I was upgraded to a junior suite, well worth the extra money in my opinion. </DOC> Got 1 night voucher for Pillo hotel Ashbourne. This is third time staying here. Check in was quick and efficient. Room was excellent. Great lay out and very comfy bed. Breakfast next morning was excellent with lots to choose from. My wife used Jule beauty spa and has a great experience. Overall a great stay in a great hotel. </DOC> This is a good American quality hotel with everything expected from Marriott chain: comfortable beds, good AC in the room, nice buffet breakfast, polite staff. Pros - great value in 20 minutes by car distance from the center of Dublin and the same distance to Newgrange, full buffet breakfast included in the rate, free parking. Cons - pool (although great addition) is not owned by hotel and shared with the athletic clubs members. Swim caps are mandatory ($3 for hotel guests), kids are not allowed to use facilities after 6PM (inconvenient for tourists who are out all day), very crowded. </DOC> Lovely hotel, modern, bright and good service. Rooms are good size with 2 double beds. Breakfast was self serve and tasty. Bar and Restaurant also good and keenly priced. Nice decor. Great location. Will return again soon. Booked again for next year. </DOC> Stayed here last week. I received a very nice warm welcome from the gentleman on reception.The hotel has changed owners recently but I did not notice any upgrading work being carried out. The bed rooms are comfortable and big but need to be upgraded as they are a bit tired and some fittings need replacing. Food is very good with efficient service. But I find the bar staff are pre occupied with them selves and just lack some hospitality training. Not a major issue but would be helpful. Over all a nice hotel near all major roads and Dublin Airport. Frank C"

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'Great hotel, modern, great pool and spa. Staff very friendly and check in fast and fuss free. Close to ferries to other islands and near loads of shops restaurants and the bus station which has a good service to the airport. There are takeaways seconds away from hotel (down the road on the right as you leave the hotel) if you fancy dinner on the harbour. Breakfast was really nice with a lovely view over the harbour. </DOC> Royal Yacht gets one of my rare 5* reviews - not because it\'s the plushest hotel we have stayed at but it does everything so well and ticks the boxes for a short break. Located in the town centre, close to shops, restaurants and transport hubs. Rooms are a little frayed around the edges but comfortable and well equipped. Ground floor bar and Zodiac brasserie are buzzy and food is surprisingly good. Excellent indoor pool, gym and spa are a real bonus. Breakfast buffet good - small issue with egg station which is a \'scrum\' at busy times. Last but not least the brilliant staff, from reception to restaurants and housekeeping who looked after us so well. Can\'t wait to return and explore more of the island. </DOC> A very popular bar and hotel with great views over the marina and beyond from the heated terrace. Friendly and helpful staff with extensive menu and wine list. Great spot for people watching and spending a relaxing lunch/afternoon with friends and some wine. A must when in Jersey. </DOC> I have reviewed this hotel before and due to his being such a great place, we decided to stay again this year. Well, it was just as fab as last time, can\'t fault it from the helpful staff, superb rooms, excellent food, great spa, need I say more........................ </DOC> Although November the weather was mild and sitting on the terrace of the Hotels Cafe Zephyr it could have been August. This is just one of a number of bars adjoining the Hotel and adding to its general appeal. Staff trained to a high standard, rooms superb, only gripe being the room temp which was too cold or hot and not in-between. In general this beats the competition on the waterfront any day. Just be prepared to pay for this luxury. </DOC> The Royal Yacht hotel is rather special. Whether you are in the old part (totally refurbished) or new part, the hotel is a model of modern design with attention to detail. The use of lighting, design and space optimisaiotn sets this hotel apart. The bars and restaurants provide good food, and the hotel\'s location is great - close to the marina and the shopping district. The spa is particularly impressive. </DOC> Have just spent 7 nights on a B&B basis in a Gold Deluxe room on the top floor.Our room-508-afforded decent views of the harbour, was spacious and we enjoyed having a sizeable balcony.We encountered security/privacy issues on 2 occasions when children from neighbouring rooms entered our balcony/room as there is no barrier on the balcony to prevent this.Room service was good ,especially when undertaken by a Romanian lady who was first class. The breakfast offering was fine particularly the continental selections.Personally I was disappointed there were no figs or dates available as they are usually my first choice at home.Service again was faultless. The welcome announcement on the TV system appears to be jammed as we are certainly not "Mrs Ann Ball". Overall the hotel is a good standard 4* . </DOC> For a more intimate and relaxed visit to The Yacht, go to the Posh Bar. It\'s very small so get there early if you want a seat! Full bar menu including wine and cocktails. More of a lounge feel than the other bars in The Yacht, better for relaxed conversation.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'We stayed in Auchrannie again - this time for a couple of days to celebrate our Silver Wedding Anniversary Once again we had a very enjoyable stay - very relaxing and comfortable with excellent food and service The weather could have been a bit better - one day hot and sunny the next torrential rain - but we are used to this in Arran and know to come prepared for anything Thanks again </DOC> Stunning facilities, excellent location and superb food.The \'quality\' is palpable in every respect.It has everything in abundance and the lodge was palatial.Enjoyed watching the seals bask on rocks in the sun off the coast a memorable visit </DOC> We stayed for two nights and would have liked to stay longer. The hotel\'s catch -phrase, "Auchrannie is addictive" is very apt. Everywhere was clean, the staff first class and a seamless service at the restaurant, both at breakfast and dinner. We stayed in the resort building and found it very quiet and peacefull. The views from the rooms are of course wonderful. The pool and fitness centre were great. </DOC> This gorgeous hotel and spa resort on the edge of Brodick is a world of luxury in the Scottish Isles. Catch the ferry over from Dunoon and enjoy the warm welcome, great service, luxury accommodation, especially in the main hotel and do book the fabulous dinner in the Garden Restaurant. Local beers and whisky just round of those long culinary delights. We love it and have visited again and again and again. </DOC> Auchrannie never fails to deliver. The new aspa is lovely and the treatments were really relaxing. Friendly staff , lovely room and delicious food ! Brambles could still do with a bit more variety for vegetarians but Cruise has a lot of choice. </DOC> The rooms are immaculate and very modern and clean in the Exec rooms which are well worth the extra money. Toiletries are all Arran aromatics and add a telly nice touch. Pool, steam room and sauna fantastic. My only grumble would be the WiFi it\'s shocking and provides an unstable connection constantly kicking you off or not letting you on which is frustrating. </DOC> Acknowledged as the flagship hotel of Arran, one of the most beautiful islands in Europe. The hotel has two leasure clubs with pools, a spa and an outdoor adventure centre. Large rooms, very good food </DOC> Travelled here with son,daughter in law and grandson.Would have taken a lodge but none available.We stayed in the House which was great with its own pool and lounges with log fire and restaurant.The whole complex is spotless,comfy and relaxing and even with a toddler wandering about you felt at ease.Staff are spot on,really friendly and helpful.Good location short walk from town and ferry terminal although hotel runs comp bus.Only real complaint was being charged on checking out for a one year old \xc2\xa320 for 2 breakfasts despite being on a B&B deal.They subsequently refunded \xc2\xa310 but given how much we had spent on meals,drinks etc as well as accommodation meant we left on a slightly sour note.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'Lovely big rooms though the sofa in our friends room was in need of repair! Breakfast was lovely. Didn\'t get the chance to have an evening meal but menu looks good. Staff friendly and service good. Liked the nice big towles, big bathroom, not all rooms have shower cubical, ours had shower in bath, OK for able body guests. Would go again. </DOC> Here for 2 day break first impressions really nice and peaceful setting. Seen promptly by the man in reception and very helpful. Got to room nicely decorated and very clean pity about the uncomfy bed. The whole resort is clean and tidy and all the staff very helpful . The swimming pool area with hot tub steam room and sauna great. We were dinner bed and breakfast the food really good although in the first morning very slow to fill up the breakfast buffet the dinner in the evening in the restaurant was first class although the drink tennants lager was the worst ever it was ok upstairs didn\'t get good sleep due to uncomfy bed room 21 but it won\'t stop us from going back. </DOC> The location of this is great, lots of walks and history very close by. The welcome on arriving was good and I was very impressed by our room. The food / restaurant wasn\'t do great. Very poor service for evening meal and when I left my breakfast (very poor eggs Benedict) I was told that they had an excellent chef and perhaps I should try something different on the menu. I explained it wasn\'t to my taste (the sauce was awful), and again was told it was probably me that wasn\'t used to that sort of food. Wouldn\'t return due to food and restaurant staffs attitudes. </DOC> This resort I\'d situated near wonderful walking and golfing amenities. We were there for Xmas and enjoyed the ceilidh on Xmas Eve. The food was plentiful however it was over cooked and the meat quite tough. The apartments are old and need modern amenities such as a dish washer and the bathrooms need work. Enjoyable but not outstanding </DOC> This was our first time at Moness and having read a lot of negative reviews on TA, we were a bit concerned about our choice. However we loved it, the "cottage" was clean and comfortable. The grounds are spacious and well laid out, with a 10 minute walk into Aberfeldy. Staff were helpful, the swimming pool a big bonus. We look forward to a return visit. We booked directly with the resort. </DOC> We stayed in a Garden Room and were impressed at how cosy (this was in January!) quiet and spacious it was. Possibly an extra mat at the entrance might have been useful at this time of year. There is a lovely dining room where we enjoyed a super meal, a relaxing swimming pool which you can virtually have to yourselves if you choose the right time. We also had fun making use of the badminton court where it is easy to obtain a booking slot. The staff were friendly and helpful. The resort is within easy distance of the town of Aberfeldy by walking (a little path from the resort through the woods makes for a short cut while avoiding any need to walk on the road). Furthermore, you are right next to the beautiful Birks o\' Aberfeldy immortalised by Robert Burns. What more could you want! </DOC> We used to be "Owners" at Moness, but relinquished our cottage a couple of years ago. The resort is still very well looked after, and the grounds are pristine. The staff are pleasant and helpful. There have been many improvements since we last visited, and our family were delighted with their meal in the main restaurant. Once they sort out the TV signal this will be less frustration for guests who want to watch anything other than a BBC channel. The beds are a bit hard, and this takes a bit of getting used to! </DOC> This is a lovely setting just a mile outside Aberfeldy. Our one bedroom lodge was very clean and comfortable. The swimming pool, spa, sauna and steam room were attached to the restaurant and were well subscribed. The food was good without being special. There are a number of attractions and walks in the surrounding area with the Birks Walk a must.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"We used this for our airport parking. Stayed the night before, but there was a boxing match on and ended up having to park in a field?? Room looked a bit tired, and was very warm, but couldn`t keep window open at night, as people from boxing coming and going, and we had a 3a.m start! Dinner was not that nice, tried to hurry us to order a drink as soon as we sat down, then didn`t come back for about 20mins? Meal was ok, but not as good as previously. Good transfer to and from hotel, so not sure whether to use hotel again? </DOC> We stayed for a night here (2nd time) and the Hotel does a really good job of the whole Fly-Drive experience. Overnight stay was comfortable, the meal good, and service friendly, especially from our lady Airport Transfer Coach! We'll do it again for sure. </DOC> Used this as a Park and Fly staying overnight on our return. Very professional in the set up sort the car out. On our return car was ready and we checked in. Remember you pay for what you get, and certainly the room had seen better days, handle missing from chest of draws, and a TV that had no remote and could only get one channel. But all we wanted was somewhere to put our heads down after 23 hours of travel. We went for a meal, but the restaurant was not open so settled for their stone baked pizza, which was a pleasant surprise. It is on the flight path which makes it noisy. But we set off after 5 hours sleep at 11 pm. The Ritz it is not, more Crossroads. But combined parking and a bed and shower. </DOC> Stayed here one night before flying out to the Emirates. Great rate for 7 days parking and the stay (\xc2\xa349). Felt the room was a bit on the small side but comfortable enough and clean. Staff had told me the day before they could provide an early checkin from 12 but ended up waiting in the lobby until 1.40pm (normal checkin at 2pm). Shuttle driver who took me to the airport at 4am was very helpful. Free wifi was good. </DOC> Booked this hotel with long term parking for the night before our flight. I was really impressed for the money. Decent room and good organisation taking to airport etc and collection. Bit scary coming back in night looking for the car so maybe not ideal for sole female travellers. Ate in restaurant too which was really good. All staff very friendly. will definitely return when flying from Glasgow. </DOC> We stayed here for a relatives wedding. Otherwise we would have turned around and gone elsewhere. We were first booked into room 116. I walked into the room and immediately returned to reception. The room was a twin and we had booked a double. The room was filthy, scruffy and like stepping back to the 80,s. I understand the hotel is famous for tribute nights but, an 80,s themed room!!! We were changed to room 130 and please take a look at the photo,s as too poor to put into words. The wedding was excellent so well done on that. The bar was ok even though above average price. The restaurant was ok and breakfast acceptable. However, the rooms really do need some updating. </DOC> One of the main purposes of this hotel is to provide preflight accommodation,secure parking ,and a airport shuttle service all for one price,having used this hotel on several occasions i have to say it is ideal for this the rooms are clean and comfy the meals and staff in the dining room are very good ,however as previous reviewers have correctly said bar prices are steep but bear in mind you get shuttle and free secure parking we will definitely use the Normandy again </DOC> Can't speak highly enough of the reception staff. I made a mistake with on line booking and they sorted it all out for us in no time. We used this for a one night stay before an early flight . Transfer was also very smooth."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"This a traditional small town hotel and it serves its purpose well. Rooms are clean and well presented. Maybe a little dated but you get what you pay for. Staff are pleasant, food is good, hotel is central. Passes the acid test with flying colour-s - cooked breakfast is superb. </DOC> Stayed for 1 night as part of a highland tour. By far the worst accomodation of the trip. Hotel tired & dated with a filthy stair/hall carpet. Our room/floor had been redecorated (hall carpet still filthy & worn) & the smell of paint was still noticable. Having said that the bed was reasonably comfortable. Breakfast ingredients were poor and worst of our trip. I would not stay here again. </DOC> A warm welcome awaits at check in which is very quick. The single rooms are very small but adequate. The whole building is very clean. The bed was comfy. Wifi is a bit slow so we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t FaceTime back home. Breakfast was excellent. We stayed as we were playing golf in the area and for this it is ideal. Recommended. </DOC> We only booked the day before for our one night stay in Tain and were upgraded to a large room with four poster bed on the first floor. The hotel is in an old building and everything creaks a bit, but it all works. The bed was comfortable, the shower was OK and the staff were pretty good. Dinner and breakfast in the restaurant were only average, but probably as expected. Would stay again if in the area and didn\xe2\x80\x99t have time to research the perfect B&B. </DOC> I went to thr Royal recently for a meal with a friend. I had the Prawn Thai Green curry, which was fantastic and would recommend it. I had the Brownie and vanilla ice cream for pudding, which again was delicious! Great atmosphere and service. No complaints and I'm really picky.. </DOC> I visited this hotel for lunch recently. I had prawn thai grren curry which was tasty if a little bit watery sauce. service was ok as was the prices. It is in a good location for people watching if you get a window seat. </DOC> Service was good with plenty of staff, restaurant had a great atmosphere for a Monday night. Salmon starter was a bit basic and could have done with an accompaniment but was fresh and well received. Main course I went for chicken wrapped in bacon on bed of leeks, which was superb, perfectly cooked and plentiful. Thoroughly recommend a visit </DOC> We had an evening meal at the Royal Hotel in Tain. There is a nice dining area in the lounge bar and we were given a window seat showing great views of Tain High Street. There was an extensive menu plus a sheet with the day's specials on offer. The prices were slightly on the high side but not outrageous. Our waiter was very friendly and had banter with all of our party. The food was first class and our only minor complaint was that there was a long delay in receiving our sweet course. It is definitely worth while stopping off at the Royal for a meal."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'Great atmospheric hotel in a great location, perfect for forays into the Cuillins. Nice room, great bar, fab restaurant. Weather was excellent although still just as "midgy" as I remember from our last visit. What more is there to say? We\'ll be back! </DOC> Stayed 2 nights with friends from USA. Booked superior rooms which were huge, and probably worth the premium. Hotel has a real feeling of a country house, and though located away from any town, and thankfully away from other hotels, in had real charm. Unfortunately the weather was grim so spent one afternoon by the cosy fire and did some single malt tasting! The adjoining bar/restaurant was well worth a visit for casual drinking and dining. Warm greeting on arrival, and Rachel and Ray both could not do enough to make stay comfortable: thank you to both. </DOC> We stayed here when we photographed in the Isle of Skye. The rooms are clean, comfortable, and quiet, but not overly large. Our staff were spectacular; they were very helpful and made us feel welcome. There is a small bar area in which we could chat before dinner or later. Meals were great with many selections. We had bagged lunches prepared for us as we spent most of our day traveling throughout the countryside. There is a river next to the hotel that offered great photographic opportunities. This is a great place to stay if you are in the area and want to relax and enjoy! </DOC> A legendary hotel amidst the Cuillin hills in a setting second to none. The reception staff gave a warm welcome. Our room was small and clean but sparse and there was no hot water for a shower at 9.30pm. Unfortunately our visit to the dining room coincided with the arrival of a large noisy party. The food was distinctly average although the waiting staff were doing their best. WiFi is available only in the public rooms. Worth a visit if you care more about a love for the hills and care rather less about high comfort levels. </DOC> Myabe not the first person to use their tag line but the hotel bar is welcoming and offers wide array of highland delights. I had a pint of the regular pump beer then a black one...both well kept and very tasty. Bar staff quite chirpy giben they were very busy. Spinksy tip: this is a very popular spot at the foot of the Cuillins and a natural cross roads with an historic bridge across the car park.Expect crowds at peak times. </DOC> All in alone of our best hotels. Old hotel with modern comforts, good suppers and breakfast. WiFi spotty but that\'s par for the course in the Highlands. Staff very friendly and helpful. John was especially knowledgeable and helped us plan our next few days in the highlands. </DOC> The Sligachan hotel has been in business since 1930 and is a favourite for travellers and climbers. The all weather centre or Seamas\' bar is a great place for a beer or some coffee. Also has entertainmnent at werekends. Recommended. </DOC> As mentioned a number of times, you stay here mainly because of the location, and to spend an evening in the bar re-living the adventures of the day. The rooms are generally clean and comfortable, the food is nothing really to write home about but if you are not expecting a 5 star experience you will probably enjoy it'

SUMMARY:  b'Marvelford is a great city with a good location and the rooms are large and well appointed .breakfast was the best we have had in the past and was very impressed !not much in the hotel to choose from and would recommend to others and would choose this hotel again</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"We stayed for 2 nights, the welcome was great. We were given a small double room with sea view with no extra charge in exchange for the booked twin room without sea view! Rooms &a bathrooms were clean. A3-course dinner was included, choice was excellent, food was good, bar prices were reasonable. Service throughout was excellent. Wifi wasn't available in the room but was in the lounge downstairs. There is also plenty of walking to be done around the area from the hotel. </DOC> We stayed here for two nights and had a very enjoyable stay. Our room was spacious and had view of the village harbour and it was spotlessly clean. There was a bath with shower that worked well. The general d\xc3\xa9cor is plain but everything seemed well maintained. The breakfast was a buffet and things were hot and well cooked, some fresh fruit would have been nice though. The hotel caters largely for coach parties and for that reason I imagine that dinner stopped at 8pm. We chose not have dinner in the hotel but this was not a problem as there is a good choice in the village. </DOC> Stayed here for 4 nights with Shearings. Good size room, warm and spotless, small bathroom with bath and shower. The staff were all friendly and helpful especially the girl behind the bar. There was a very good choice of tasty food, better than other Shearing Hotels we have been to. Service was fast and friendly. The views over the town are stunning but the walk down there is a bit scary in bad weather, quite steep and lots of steps. Would love to go back in the summer. </DOC> Wow, views from our room were awesome. We stayed here with Shearings from 25 - 29th January and paid an extra \xc2\xa356 for a seaview, which was worth every penny. This is by far the best hotel we have stayed at with Shearings. I think the pre booking your time for dinner each evening is a bonus. The food was very good with a good menu each evening to choose from. Our only niggles with the hotel was that they only had 1 toaster to cater for all the guests, so there was always a queue to do toast. There was not a good selection of fresh fruit and yoghurts at breakfast, a few but not much choice really. All the staff were very friendly and I would highly recommend this hotel. </DOC> my wife and i had looked at this hotel a few times when we were out a run in the car so we decided to have an easter break and stay for a couple of days......big mistake....this must be one of the worst hotels i have stayed in. first, the reception was not what i would say would have created a good lasting impression, second, the room had a first class view but the windows were less than air tight, the toilet curtain was blowing out at 45 degrees and the window was closed , the decor was, well , what decor. third, the meals were a joke no more to be said there, overall a dreadfull break in a dreadfull hotel. of course this was a couple of years ago , so it may have improved, but i wont be going back to find out. </DOC> We stayed for 2 nights in this impressive looking hotel with a commanding location overlooking the town of Portpatrick. Our room was comfortable with a magnificent view over the harbour and we appreciated having direct access to the patio at the front of the hotel and also the hotel carpark. The hotel is next to a starting point for the Southern Upland Way and we enjoyed the wonderful clifftop walk within a few yards of our room. The breakfast was good but our evening meal was disappointing. This is a very comfortable hotel with an outstanding location. </DOC> Fancied a change from eating out so booked self catering flat. Comfortable. Small kitchen and comfortable bed -huge. Sign posting to the hotel would be useful. We didn't use any of the hotel facilities. The staff didn't appear chatty or over friendly. Nice setting for the hotel on hill top. </DOC> Had a fab weekend in portpatrick got a great deal and cannot fault this hotel we had a refurbished room which was a added bonus, staff were all very helpful and cannot grumble about the food plenty of choice at breakfast and two toasters for making your own so never a wait chef was also out checking the hot food so always refilled evening meals were three courses plus tea or coffee and again lovely if I had one small request it would be for side plates in the morning for buttering your toast unless I may have missed them would definitely recommend this hotel"

SUMMARY:  b"I booked a 2 bedroom suite and were very pleased with the room and the breakfast was great as well as the location of the hotel .would be happy to have stayed here as there was no one at the hotel and we had to wait for the bus to get to the beach which was not the best option , not a great option for the beach and beach , we did not use the pool and spa , but we did n't use it as we were in the area for a wedding and were unable to find a good cup</DOC>"

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"In spite of a few niggles, like a non-working lift and drinks machine, we really enjoyed our couple of nights here. As many people have mentioned the parking is convenient and reasonably priced, as is the hotel itself within striking distance of Beale Street, the Mississippi and the Museum of Civil Rights. The staff are super friendly and the rooms are large, clean and comfortable. The breakfast was more than adequate and there are plenty of other good options for eating in the area. Well worth a look! </DOC> I was apprehensive at first by the name and wondered what was in store. It was a very nice, comfortable room which was perfect for Beale Street. Breakfast included but not brilliant, bog standard Choice, DIY waffles and weak coffee. Would recommend though. </DOC> The hotel is a 10 minute walk from beale street and has a park at the front and back The staff we came across were lovely The room was well kept and clean The basin was 'outside' of the bathroom right in the room so not much privacy The toilet and large shower were behind a door, the shower did protrude quite a way into the room The bathroom had shampoo, conditioner and body lotion and more than enough towels The bed was comfy and the aircon/heater worked well Breakfast the next morning was scrambled egg, bacon, cereal, yoghurts, toast, bagels, muffins, juice and coffee A really good Base for memphis </DOC> The hotel is within walking distance of Mud Island Park, Beale Street and the trolley line that goes past the Civil Rights Museum. However, the rooms are small and the sink is in the sleeping area. I would recommend this hotel becasue of its location to some of the main attractions in Memphis. </DOC> We arrived after a long day of driving. Amber greeted us as Choice members and made us feel so welcome. After getting us checked in, she made great suggestions for restaurants. This location is fantastic as it is very close to sights - some may be a little longer but we walk. We will go back as we did not see/do all we would have liked to. Thanks again. </DOC> Great location, easy parking out front. Friendly staff. Double rooms are massive. Ability to come and go from parking lot is a nice feature. Sitting right beside the river, there is lots to walk and see and right on trolley track too. Breakfast is the usual but was fine. </DOC> This hotel is in downtown Memphis with the trolley stop right outside the door which will take you to many of the local attractions downtown. The staff were very friendly, the room clean and the breakfast was very good with an attendant should you need anything. The only negative comment is that the king rooms were very small for two people. </DOC> The location of this place is perfect. It is within walking distance of many restaurants and most of Memphis' main attractions. Considering this, rates are reasonable. Our room was nice and clean, staff was friendly. Breakfast was average, Wifi terrible."

SUMMARY:  b"nestled bw is a great place to stay and if you 're looking for a place to stay near the airport and need to be at the same price we would have given the hotel a higher rating .there were no signs of wear , but we were very happy with my room .</DOC>"

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'Pretty standard City Centre Hotel. Check in ladies were an absolute delight, friendly and knowledgeable. This is right opposite the Peabody so worth the trip over to see the Ducks Marching. Short walk to Beale St. </DOC> Well placed just over the roasd from The Peabody. Staff very friendly and helpfull,especially desk staff and bar staff. They were very helpfull and chatty which makde our stay much more enjoyable. Last time we were in Memphis we stayed at the Peabody,this hotel offered the same great location at a fraction of the cost. Beale Street is an aquired taste but worth the effort,some good resturants. </DOC> Great location if you like staying in the city. The hotel is located a few blocks from Beale Street and just a few steps from The Rendezvous Rib Joint! The staff is friendly and helpful. My room was clean and nicely appointed. The only meal I had there was breakfast and well, it was breakfast. Nice lounge with friendly bartender is adjacent to the lobby. The only complaint I have is that the the hotel shuttle vans (with the hotel name on them) will not take you to the airport (or anywhere else) unless you are part of an airline crew. It cost about $30 plus tip for a taxi to or from the airport so you can expect to add about $75 to the cost of staying here if you need transportation. I will have to do some research to see if there is another downtown hotel with an airport shuttle. </DOC> I have stayed at this hotel many many times over the years as a loyal Holiday Inn business traveler. This hotel has some age but has years of character and charm from downtown Memphis and Beale street that keep me coming back. The staff have always been friendly and helpful and this place has great and easy access to the downtown and nightlife. </DOC> Needed a place to stay at the last minute & we chose this hotel for the price. We were very happy with our stay, good location (2 blocks to Beale St) & kids ate free. Room was older but nice, the noise of the renovations were not a distraction at all. Staff were very friendly. </DOC> We stayed here during the recent music festival. The location is great. We were a few blocks from Beale St, and we could walk just about everywhere in the city. The room was a reasonable size, and we had a great view of the Peabody. The staff was friendly. We did have to deal with some of the city noise, but the sound level wasn\'t too bad, and we still slept reasonably well. I do feel we were somewhat \'nickeled and dimed\'. For example, we had to pay $24/day to park, and breakfast was not included with the room. The bathroom was a little on the small side, and the shower had only a glass partition covering about 1/3 of the shower area, which meant a lot of water on the floor. </DOC> I was surprised to see that some previous reviews said that the hotel was outdated and, in one review, called "yucky." Far from it. Maybe I have low expectations, but I actually thought it was pretty nice. The front desk staff was fantastic! We arrived early and our room was ready. The room and entire hotel itself looked very clean. Had a nice view of the historic hotel across the street. Wifi worked well. My only complaint is that the shower had a slow drain. It was in a pretty good location (close to Beale St, the Main Street Trolley, and the Rock n Soul Museum where you can catch the shuttle to Graceland) and I felt safe the whole time walking around the area (even by myself). If you want to be downtown, this is the place to stay. </DOC> Located 2 blocks from Beale Street, many signs apologising for the upgrades and improvements they are making. Initially given an occupied room, but quickly sorted out. Good bar with good food, only one server on at any time, but they were friendly and efficient. Tiny bathroom, watch out for the well dressed street walkers. Watch the duck parade at the Peabody Hotel opposite.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"Been here several times, always busy and fun. Good atmosphere and nice food too. A good place to meet up after work for drinks - if you decide to eat you can order and have it brought to the table. Nice informal eating. </DOC> My wife & I stayed for 3 nights (May 10th to 13th) and although the weather was not kind the hotel and Aberaeron more than made up for that. We were greeted like old friends(thanks Dai), the room was great with fantastic views from the bathroom and the bedroom (Cadwgan). We ate in the restaurant on 2 nights and the service & food were first class on both occasions, reasonably priced wine as well! The bar was well used by locals & guests with local beer and well priced wines available. The town itself is really pretty with lots of choices for eating & drinking and everyone we met during our stay was so friendly & welcoming, we will definitely be returning. </DOC> Stayed here for two nights, excellent food and accommodation , we caught a bus to new quay and walked back on the coast road absolutely brilliant, weather was good I would imagine it could be muddy when raining, Dia the hotel manager was very good with full of advise, we had a room overlooking the harbour again this made our mini break great looking at grandads teaching their grandchildren fishing could have watched them for hours, again fantastic atmosphere in the bar mixing with local people, will be back sooner than later. </DOC> We have stayed at this lovely hotel several times over the last 10 years....indeed we were one of the first guests in 2002! Our latest visit was at the end of May 2012 to see the Olympic torch pass through Aberaeron. The accommodation ( we particularly like The Madona room right up in the top of the main hotel)....food...service and setting are all still second to none - and the welcome by Glyn and Menna cannot be beaten!!!! As you can tell....this is one of our favourite hotels in Great Britain - a very good starting place for glorious walks along the coastal path overlooking Cardigan Bay. Here's to more visits over the next 10 years! Ron&Julia </DOC> Stayed at the Harbourmaster at the end of July 2011. We had room No 1 (brilliant view over the harbour). The room was good, a bit small maybe, but more than made up for it with the fabulous view. The restaurant dinner was excellent. We had the Cote de Boeuf which was enormous, and came with the best bearnaise I have ever tasted! The breakfasts were also among the best. Wonderful bacon & sausage. Good work folks, keep it up! We will be back </DOC> This hotel didn't disappoint, it's not cheap but from reception all the way through, it was a really enjoyable short break. The daily complimentary coffee and cake was a nice touch. Good breakfast, excellent dinner with well trained and attentive staff (Nia & Gwenno particularly). Super room with marvellous and well appointed large bathroom, didn't go on the balcony as it was October! Recommended for short breaks Any criticism, not really but suggest that the extractor fan in the bathroom is cleaned, it was clogged up with fluff! </DOC> I had not been to the Harbourmaster for some years, and was keen to see if it had changed. It had. It was better than ever. We stayed at the cottage, which was beautifully equipped. The room was not large, but was beautifully furnished with a very comfortable bed with Frette linen and a Melin Tregwynt bedhead and counterpane. There was an enormous flatscreen TV. The bathroom was simply superb, with both a bathtub and a separate soaker shower. Downstairs, there was a comfy seating area and a well-equipped kitchen. We enjoyed a drink at the excellent bar in the main hotel. Service was friendly and attentive, though very informal and modern. I love this hotel. It is a great advertisement for Wales and I hope to return very soon. Recommended without hesitation. </DOC> The Harbourmaster is well rated and came highly recommended by friends. We were not disappointed. We booked the last room available - actually in the 'cottage' next door and it was a typical cottage room, overlooking the harbour. Dinner was superb - amuse bouche 'soup', bread with oil and crushed nuts, excellent scallops followed by main course of delicious lobster with an unusual but very tasty kale with chili and garlic. We will do the same again!"

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"Check in and out was smooth. Room was clean, bathroom clean and bed was comfortable. Location is within walking distance of restaurants and some shopping. Breakfast was more than adequate. Plenty of parking and close to the Florida Turnpike. I would definitely stay here again. </DOC> We did not get a good feeling when we saw a security guard at the entrance of the parking lot, and I thought that we should remove all the belongings from the car because the neighborhood could be bad at night. Inside the atmosphere was totally different and was warm and friendly. After we checked in the receptionist gave us a bottle of water and a cookie. Room and bathroom were clean and quiet. Breakfast was good. We liked this hotel. Also, it is was close to the big Southland mall and near many restaurants. </DOC> Mid Size hotel with updated rooms including some nice rarely seen features including wall mounted climate controls and ceiling fans. Bathrooms are split toilet/bath and separate sink area which is convenient. Hotel staff is top notch and ready to assist when needed. Including courteous and efficient late night security. A few items of negative include smell of cat urine on 4th floor hallway and some roaches in the room. A wish their was a business center for printing to help with guests staying at hotel for business purposes. Also room window coverings are not adequate. Hotel is about 35 minutes/ 16 miles southwest of the airport and downtown Miami. Area has much to offer with food and shopping. </DOC> This chain hotel offers good rooms at good rates. It is located neither too far from Miami nor from Everglads and the keys, making it a good stop. It was clean and in good shape. They offer breakfast, but it was crowded and not much to select from. </DOC> This was our second stay at this hotel and it was still as good as our stay last year. The hotel is somewhat dated but it is clean and fairly well maintained. The front desk staff and housekeeping were great. Even though there is road construction nearby, the hotel area was quite. There are many attractions, shopping and places to eat nearby. The parking lot is well lighted. </DOC> good hotel for the price. more or less clean rooms (the wall section of the bed needs a cleaning) but otherwise very clean and nice rooms. As room 202 is close to the exit you will wake up early as the door closes very loud, so if possible avoid this room due to this if you like to sleep long. breakfast was also very good if you do not expect warm food, for us more then ok as closer to a European breakfast. would go there anytime again. Check in agent very attentive. </DOC> Great location for attending the races at Miami Homestead Speedway, real close to turnpike. Their rates are pretty jacked up for the race weekend, like most hotels, they take advantage of fans when an event is going on. The room was definitely not worth what we paid for it, but that was the going rate in the area I guess. Found plenty of shopping close by, a couple of chain restaurants nearby. Room was big, breakfast was regular la Quinta fare, waffles, toast, cereal. Not like some others that have eggs, bacon, sausage.... Big difference between the weekday and weekend housekeepers, weekend one cut corners, didn't re stock coffee, cups, or even all the towels. Front desk staff was nice. </DOC> We are Laquinta gold members. We were on a road trip to key west and decided to stop to sleep here. We upgraded to the king suite, and if it was an upgrade, I'd hate to see a regular room, the door to enter was all damaged, the room was huge, but carpet was peeled up in big lumps. The furniture was very damaged. This was not a nice Laquinta!!"

Once again perfect, 5 star accommodation and facilities. Conference venue A1 Room A1 large and very well appointed Gym Sauna and spa A1 Didn't have time to go outside as a bit damp and no time. Back again next year. </DOC> Thank you once again to Bianca and her team member Nicole. Amazing, relaxing treatment. Genuine, caring and loved the extra touch of the scalp massage. Thank you for making me feel so special. The fruit platter and herbal tea was d'lish. ......cheers </DOC> This accommodation has everything you would expect from a resort style accommodation set in the gateway of the Yarra Valley.

Service and facilities would have to be classed as the best we have ever stayed in. We are not golfers so did not utilise the magnificent course, but if you were it would be classed as outstanding. Rooms and service are 100%. Restaurant again 100%. Close to town but being on the outskirts in a country location the only noise is the birds. Could not have been a better two days. Congratulations to RACV. </DOC> We stayed at the resort for our wedding anniversary and it was perfect, staff were friendly, the resort was set out well. On entering our room we received a complimentary bottle of Chandon for our celebration, what a wonderful gift. We played 2 games of golf, ate at the Terrace bistro, very reasonably priced, service was great and friendly. We had a twilight walk on the course and saw plenty of Kangaroos and a couple of Kookaburras. There is lots to do there, Tennis, Swimming, Lawn Bowls, etc. Free WiFi is also a bonus. It was a great break. </DOC> This hotel is sitting among picturesque hills Inside it\xe2\x80\x99s warm and cozy when outside it\xe2\x80\x99s frosty and wet. Good size rooms and lots spaces around the hotel to sit, read and spend time. Good sized meeting rooms and catering for work activities. </DOC> Loved staying here for the weekend with my husband and toddler. Check in was fast and efficient and room was lovely and clean and spacious for us all. My 3yo had a great time in the outdoor and indoor pool. Unfortunately the play ground was closed which he was a bit upset about as was the spa but none the less we had a wonderful time using the other facilities. Dinner was fantastic both nights and breakfast was ok - as my toddler isn't very restaurant friendly we had breakfast delivered to our room which was ok, not great but ok. Great stay and we can't wait to come back. </DOC> I have just returned from a stay at the RACV resort. The room was spotlessly clean and had all the comforts we needed. The Friday night buffet was excellent and so many choices, I am not normally a big eater, but it was hard not to go back for more. We played eighteen holes of golf and enjoyed the country vistas around the course. Will look forward to going back soon."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'I stayed at this hotel which was convenient to the airport when two other hotels were not available. First I Have to say that the staff was excellent. Everyone was very accommodating and pleasant to work with. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean. Good water pressure in the shower which is always a plus. The plumbing,however, was left clogged from the previous occupant perhaps. Maintenance did get right on it when contacted. Convenient to local attractions so it was full off aim.ies on vacation. </DOC> Hotel has a very nice open and attractive lobby. Rooms are a bit dated. Compared to the newer hotels. There was a chair in our room that looked very old and not too clean. Drapes were stained. Lots of electronics plugs. Very nice tile bathroom floors., but old green carpet in room. Walk-in shower was nice, but the shower curtain should be a more modern glass door or wall. No powered fan in bathroom. Breakfast was very good, but can only be described as a madhouse. Great friendly and courteous staff. </DOC> Loved this property. The hot tub, the indoor/outdoor pool, the free drinks in the lobby, the proximity to the airport. Lots of granite in the rooms. Staff were quite friendly, showing customers they cared. Would return in a heartbeat. </DOC> We were in the area for three nights and after spending one night at another chain, we decided to return to our Nashville favorite, Drury. We had a suite with a separate bedroom and two tv\'s. The living room had a sofa bed and a recliner plus the desk chair. Drury has the best breakfast bar of any chain we visit and now with the evening "snacks", which can easily be dinner, they are unbeatable. We have stayed at the Nashville Drury many times and like all the employees there. We hope to return often. </DOC> We stayed at the Drury Inn and service, food, cleanliness etc was exceptional. We subsequently use Trip Advisor for all our trips. Most recently to Gatlingburg, which also proved to be valuable for both eating and picking a good hotel. </DOC> My husband and I stayed at Drury Inn & Suites in September 15 2013, and our main concern traveling around is to find a place that is quite,clean, with free Wi-Fi, good location, good customer services, parking free and the bonus breakfast. This hotel has everything we were looking for, so we got a good rest to keep driving and see other places! It was our first time staying at Druri Inn and we were not disapointed! </DOC> This the second Drury Inn and Suites we have stayed in and find them very comfortable. The staff was very friendly and helpful. With the free evening meal and full breakfast, it makes a very economical stay. </DOC> We use to LOVE the Drury Inns. They were always special, clean, very dog friendly (no charge), good value ... special. I used to schedule our driving stops around Drury Inn locations. We are so sorry to say that we won\'t be staying here again. This DI is nothing special ... just basic... and it\'s always SO crowded in the food area that we just walk out. (I sense they do a lot of \'Group Deals\' that may be good for them, but overwhelming to us.) They are expensive for what we get. They now charge for pups and it goes up every year. It feels like the "family" no longer runs them and "Corporate" took over. Sad to say that we are going to have to find another alternative for our Nashville stays.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'I stayed here on a Saturday night to attend a concert at Bridgestone Arena. I had booked months ahead and there were no rooms any closer. Check in was easy and we had parking fees waived. Which considering the nightly rate on that Saturday night sure helped out. The room was standard HI, it was clean and beds comfortable. The hotel is walking distance to some attractions and restaurants. We were able to use the Hotel shuttle to the arena for the show and were also able to catch it for our ride back which saved a few more dollars. Didn\'t have time for the fitness center or pool, so not sure how that is. Overall, this is a good option for Downtown Nashville. We enjoyed our stay! </DOC> Front desk check in service was great! Our room was very clean and well stocked with everything we needed at check in. Room Cleaned each day and restocked with towels and other items. Maid staff very nice no problems. Room nicely appointed ! Soft and firm pillows on each bed 2 each. Very nice lobby and pool area. Overall clean inside and out. Shuttle service was very good used it 2 times Larry was very helpful . Restaurant was very nice , service was very good , had live music in the evenings. Only concern was parking rate per day is high $20 for self parking for this area $24 for valet and auto gate was not working correctly the entire time we were there, did mention to front desk was issued a parking card it worked 1 time. </DOC> Situated right by Vanderbilt University, and one turn off of 440, this hotel touts a great location. Our king sized room on the 12th floor faced West End Ave, and had sweeping views of the Parthenon, downtown, and the mountains in the distance. Breakfast was not included in our rate, but was $13pp, and included eggs, meats, fruits, cereals, pastries, and fruit, etc. Walk-in shower and bathroom were fairly new. Would definitely recommend! </DOC> From the time of check in, Logan was great and had a smile from side to side (something nice to arrive to after a long trip). The room and hotel are in great condition. I would usually see one of the housemen, Derrick and Engineers on the floor and both were always friendly and recognizing one. Buffet breakfast is never a bad thing to have and Jihad was on top of or table and looking out for us with fresh OJ and coffee. The room was always spotless and Erika did a great job on that. She even found my flashlight, which I left behind! Really great team!! </DOC> If you want location, this is it. For Vanderbilt, West End restaurants, and Centennial Park, this is it. It\'s not the best hotel in Nashville, but there are some good restaurants nearby. I certainly choose it when it has good rates. </DOC> Had a really good few nights stay at this Holiday Inn Nashville. Nice location opposite Centennial Park and out of the hustle and bustle of the centre of Nashville. Good size clean room with an excellent bed and nice view over the park looking at the Parthenon in the park. Free shuttle in and out of the centre throughout the stay and the staff in this hotel are lovely. Would stay here again for sure. </DOC> It was a stroll across the street to visit the Pantheon and I looked out the window to see the Vanderbilt football stadium. This is a rather old hotel, 1968, but they\'ve kept it up pretty good. The shuttle makes it easy to get downtown. They have an outdoor pool and a workout room. The room has a microwave and small fridge. The Internet was painfully slow. There is live entertainment each night where you can sit and have a meal and a drink. There is breakfast food available in the morning for purchase.During the time I stayed the price met my per diem rates. For the price and location it was a good choice. </DOC> Overall gross hotel the carpets in the hallway are filthy the lighting is bad the rooms weren\'t great overall the hotel needs a serious renovation the "restaurant" had old-style banquet tables and chairs. The workout facilities was not to bad but overall absolutely dumpy.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'The HIE is a nice hotel but could be improved. The beds were comfy and we got a good night\'s sleep. The breakfast for the most part was good. Coffee needs to be improved. It is weak and tasteless. HIE needs some rich roast or dark roast coffee. On Monday morning they were out of a lot of items but well stocked for Tuesday and Wednesday mornings. The fitness room had major problems with no sanitizing wipes and the bicycle was broken. The front desk when asked said oh we called someone I think. The keys did not work about half the time. </DOC> I had a great experience when I stayed here recently. The room was very nice and clean. The hotel is in a location far enough away from I-65 where it was quiet enough to obtain a good night of sleep. There are numerous places to eat nearby within a reasonable walking distance too. The only thing I believe needs to be addressed is a need for an additional washer and dryer in the guest laundry area so more than one guest at a time could do their laundry. Otherwise, they just need to keep doing what they are doing! </DOC> Accommodations were a little nicer than I expected and the cost reflected that as well since it was more expensive than usual (maybe because it was somewhat close to Nashville?). Do like that they include hot breakfast items on their breakfast buffet. </DOC> Easy on /off of highway. Seemed to be a newer hotel, outside grounds were well kept indoor lobby was clean and friendly. Our room was comfortable and clean as were the bed and pillows. Good selection of tv stations. Breakfast was very good with a wide selection of hot items. Breakfast area was perfect. Fitness room with 2 treadmills, stationary bike, pool weather permitting-I think the hot tub is closed. Near shopping area. </DOC> Debated on what I should rate this property and decided on a four. Our rate was good, upgraded room roomy, Cracker Barrel and two fast foods within walking distance. Christie at front desk was helpful and friendly. The fitness center needs improvement, two treadmills and a bike. Bike was old and in need of repair. Our room was above the bright lights of the entrance so that was distracting, breakfast room good size. </DOC> We are IHG Platinum Elite members. Made a reservation with the IHG credit card on the IHG website. Holiday Inn Express is part of IHG. Showed up with children and luggage to the front desk and told "sorry we are sold out." But we have a reservation, here is the confirmation number. "So what, we are sold out." No apology. No offer to help us find another place to stay. Borderline rude. Definitely made to feel as if we did something wrong. Go read my review of the Hampton Inn in White House, Tennessee to see what real customer service is. If you are in a bind, they will help you whether you have a reservation or not, unlike this business. </DOC> Room was nice as expected. We checked in 6/19/16 ..... i had called from about 12 miles away to see if they had rooms.... the lazy desk attendant put me straight thru to reservations rather than just answer the question. When i did arrive she was on the phone on what was certainly a personal call and seemed put out to check me in. Never mind it was obvious i was in physical distress having just been released from a hospital. Nice property and would stay again if need be, but the night staff needs training. </DOC> Clean inside and out. Comfortable, room very clean--no complaints. Typical Holiday Inn Express, Nice desk staff, usual free breakfast. One consistent thing across the chain--the coffee is sub par (but I don\'t blame the hotels for this, I blame corporate). Good location, plenty of dining options close by.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"I thought the Dallas Marriott City Center was great; its a nice, clean, modern hotel with good rooms and possibly the nicest concierge lounge I have encountered anywhere in the USA, with a great breakfast setup and plenty of space. </DOC> I stayed the Marriott while in town for business. In summary, it's an ok business hotel but nothing special. Further details... Pros: Good location Great customer service Large rooms Cons: Only superficially clean (hair everywhere, dirty shower curtain, dust, mold in the shower, etc.). I would stay again; however, it wouldn't be my first choice. I'd explore other options in the area. </DOC> I was not impressed. Everything about this place screamed of average Marriott with nothing more than that. The food was average, the location, contrary to many of the reviews, I found to be poor in the sense that there was nothing interesting within walking distance. Yes, there is the museum and theater nearby, but they are like islands in the middle of a few skyscrapers. Did I mention how bad the internet was? Not just for 1/2 a day, but the whole 4 days I was there...terrible - with long, long waits for technical assistance who did nothing. at least the staff was friendly </DOC> We choose this Marriott because we could take Dart from DFW to the hotel. What we did not know is it is located one block from the free trolley, three blocks from the Winspear Opera House and many other places you can walk to or take Dart. Well done Marriott.... I dropped a star only to force the hotel to open their Concierge Lounge on Friday nights, an oversight I am sure this review will correct! This hotel is a category 7 hotel and you will not be disappointed. It is oriented toward the business traveler, adult couples won't mind, kids don't have a pool which is problematic. Rooms are large, clean, well appointed. Let me know if this helps? </DOC> Stayed here for two nights with the family. Checkin was quick and easy. Room was really nice and not too small. But the service really stood out. My key kept not working and they quickly fixed it for me. I also liked that when there was a que someone appeared from nowhere to service you. Would recommend and stay again. </DOC> This was our 1st time staying in a Marriott and it won't be the last. We arrived and there were porters at our car straight away unloading our luggage. We were whisked into reception and were checked into our room within 10 minutes. The room was large and fully equipped. Bed was very comfortable and huge. Bathroom a good size and full of little bits n' pieces. All was very clean. We also ate in the restaurant downstairs next to the bar and the food was excellent as was the service. This hotel offered everything we required from a city centre hotel. We will definitely stay in a Marriott again. </DOC> I am Plat with Marriott, travel every week. This property very convenient downtown, but valet parking only. Very expensive and takes time to get your car. Good news, nice gym and very nice executive lounge. Food was excellent and the staff very friendly. Will be back again. </DOC> It was a very pleasant first time visit. The hotel is inviting, clean and close to our office. Very spacious room and clean. Workers are helpful and cordial. Definitely a second booking is a must when back in town."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"The hotel is in a great location to get around Dallas with easy access to 75. There is a bit of noise being that close to the highway but not extremely noticeable. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The lobby and bar have definitely been redone and look very nice. The rooms however could use some serious updating. Our room had an old musty smell to it, the wallpaper was peeling in spots, and the bathrooms are small and outdated. The overall room size wasn't bad, just the bathroom. Overall, for the price and location it wasn't a bad place to stay. I just expected a bit more. </DOC> As a SMU parent, I really appreciate the convenience of this hotel. Everything has been remodeled and in great shape. The main issue with room is lack of bathroom space. I could not even close the door. If you are traveling with several in the room, this would be a concern. The other issue is breakfast is not included with priority club rewards. We usually always receive this as a perk. No problems with parking or noise as others mentioned. Air conditioner made a horrible noise when turned on but then it was quiet. </DOC> Disappointed. This property once hung the Holiday Inn and Ramada signs. Now, under the Magnolia brand it is trying, really trying to be noteworthy....but the infrastructure is tired. One bright spot was my breakfast server from Nicaragua. She was attentive and cheerful. My room, on the other hand was mhhhhh. And the bathroom is TINY. My 5 6' frame felt cramped. Knees hit the door when I sat on toilet. (Really!?) The hot water did not work the first of two nights. (maintenance repaired it) The view of an abandoned SMU East Campus building was an eye sore. Won't be back. </DOC> Wonderful hotel by SMU in Dallas. Great lounge, free cookies, on site laundry and a great view. There is 24 hour security and well lit parking. It's also close to grocery stores and an amazing Brazilian cafe. Highly recommended . </DOC> At check-in the service was extremely professional and helpful. The room was quiet and modern, the bed comfortable. Happy hour was another pleasurable experience with a friendly bartender and good service. The breakfast buffet was also good and again the staff went above and beyond with exemplary service. The cookies and milk set out at 8 pm are another bonus. All around great experience and highly recommended. </DOC> This hotel is modern, welcoming, reasonably priced and near SMU and the Bush library. Excellent breakfast buffet and what a treat - milk and cookies in the evening. Room was comfortable albeit small bathroom. However, everything is 100%. I\xe2\x80\x99d stay here again in a heart beat. </DOC> We stayed here two years ago. The free breakfast buffet is gone, now $14.95 (I think). We decided to walk to Caf\xc3\xa9 Brazil for breakfast. Rooms are the same. Small bathroom. In room coffee maker, but lacks in-room safe. Good WiFi and AC, comfy bed, friendly staff, nice central lobby/atrium area. Fitness room has good quality equipment and was not crowded on this visit. Indoor pool would be a plus for families. Free parking is also a plus. Worth it because of good price and close location to SMU and restaurants. </DOC> We were in the area to see the Bush Library. The location was perfect. A one-minute drive or short walk. My wife saw Maria Bartiromo in the lobby. Very nice lobby bar, the restaurant although not fancy offered very good food. Our room was stylish and very confortable. If in the area I would stay here again."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"Typical Courtyard. Nice clean rooms, good lobby space, pretty quiet. Great location near the Zoo, Cultural District and TCU. Great running/biking trail along the river is just across the street. Staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel is 2 stories without an elevator, so plan accordingly (we had to switch rooms with my parents due to the stairs - front desk quickly switched us with no problems). </DOC> The lobby was nice, staff nice. But other than the lobby the property seems a little out of date for a Courtyard. Two stories without an elevator. Built around a center outside pool. Very convenient to TCU; maybe a 3 minute drive. Near a shopping area with restaurants and nice stores. Pretty unremarkable place, actually. </DOC> The reason to stay here is location. It's close to TCU and the Zoo, and there is a surprisingly terrific eatery called The Woodshed just a short walk behind the hotel on the river. But the hotel itself appears to be a renovated motel. The furnishings and decor than Marriott has overlayed are nice enough, but the bones are fairly 1960 and, as has been mentioned, no elevator to the second floor. There is a bistro that serves a nice breakfast and snacks throughout the day. It's fine for a short stay. </DOC> Great hotel. Excellent staff. The breakfast staff was excellent. Updated Courtyard. In good shape. Lots of parking. Clean and comfortable room. Like the balconies. Albeit in milder weather. Best part is the Trinity trail outside the hotel. Great for getting some exercise runs in. Also good for a great walk. Lots of restaurants in the area. Easy to get to this hotel. WiFi was good. Yes there is at least one elevator. Read several reviews. When you see the stairs walk 10 more feet. Turn left. There it is. Would easily stay here again. </DOC> Location is near TCU, is also walking distance to several restaurants and shops and driving distance to downtown Fort Worth. Staff is very friendly. Rooms are nice, where first floor rooms open to the outside Courtyard. Hotel has your typical Bistro and bar. </DOC> Hotel was nice, room was clean, comfortable and close to TCU. My husband has had knee surgery and doesn't do steps well so we asked for a ground floor room. We got our request and they had us just a couple of doors down from one of the back entrances. Unfortunately the key card reader on that door didn't work, so we had to walk through the entire building to reach our room. Breakfast is for purchase only and is expensive. Coffee too -- only Starbucks. We were charged for a pay-per-view movie which we didn't order, so be careful when you turn your TV on. The fee was refunded, but they acted like they didn't really believe we didn't order it. </DOC> My daughter and I stayed at this Marriott as it was close to a wedding reception. The hotel was clean. The room was adequately large. The bathroom was small including the sink area. The lobby was nice. The pool was small and the water was icy cold. There is a lovely walk way along the water, across from the hotel. The hotel was also close to a few nice restaurants and shopping area. In the overall, it was a decent hotel to stay although the rate is not cheap. </DOC> Marriott exceeds expectations! Stayed for a single night so we could walk up to the bowl game - Pitt vs. Houston. The checkin was fast and early! Thanks. Updated facility that is close to so many good restaurants. Think I'll stay here when I travel to Ft Worth for business."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"This might be one of the nicest Hampton Inn & Suites in the chain. Very nice rooms and more upscale than most Hamptons. It is in a great location and the rooms are very spacious and well done. The staff is very friendly and helpful. You can get to the mall and other shopping within minutes. It is just off the tollway so you get go into Dallas quickly. Definitely a place we will consider when in the Frisco area. </DOC> Easy to locate and close to Stonebriar Mall, ample parking. Front counter staff were very nice (and w/a sense of humor!). Room was well appointed, larger than average and very clean, large bathroom w/plenty of counter space. Water pressure is excellent. A few minor nits...the bedsheets/underpad were undersized for our king bed and the corners kept popping off during the night, (and not for the reason you're thinking). Pillows were the overstuffed synthetic type and not very conducive for comfortable sleep. Also the Phillips brand TV is one of the most frustrating to use as it has a slow response/delay to remote commands. The breakfast was descent and cheese mixed into scrambled eggs was a very nice touch. All in all, a well run comfortable hotel and one we wouldn't hesitate to use again. </DOC> This hotel is in an upscale portion of Frisco/Plano. Several corporate headquarters are located nearby, which I attribute to the higher level of quality I experienced. Hampton is a solid brand but this location was just superior to the average abampton location. Slightly oversized rooms. Nice big bathroom. Points taken off for non-functioning tv remote and force lot. Otherwise this earns four stars. </DOC> If you have stuff to do in Frisco, this is a great hotel, outside looks great, the staff was very nice, but when you get in the elevator to the rooms I felt I was in a 70's 80's decorated hotel. It just didn't go with the lobby and breakfast area of the hotel. Just threw me for a loop, they have a gym with 3 exercise equipment, but seems a little small for the size of the hotel. </DOC> So I just arrived tonight on Tuesday and will check out on Friday but so far this place is fantastic. Rooms and the facility is fabulous but Vickie and Kiara at the front desk are probably the best so far. The hospitality I received from those two have been amazing and I hope it continues the remainder of the week. They really bent over backwards to make sure I was happy. Location is great with everything you need in close proximity. While the above mentioned is great, the walls are super thin. I can clearly hear the TV next door and a simple conversation they are having. The beds are super comfy and soft. Really nothing to complain about besides thin walls. I'd recommend. </DOC> Our family had the double-queen suite with sofa-bad. The room, bath, and beds were very clean and comfortable. The overall hotel is very nice and well-appointed. I was impressed by the very professional and friendly staff and their high level of service. The free breakfast was excellent with good variety. I would recommend to family and friends. </DOC> Rooms were quite. Beds were so so. Clean. Breakfast was about the normal for hotel breakfast. Elevator was slow but they were working on the other one so kinda expected that. Looking like remodeling the place </DOC> We stayed at this location for 1 night. The front desk staff was friendly and the location was super quiet. We stayed in a 2 queen bed suite that overlooked the front of the hotel. The room was HUGE and had a wetbar and fridge. The beds were comfortable and the room was very clean, well laid out. The breakfast was standard stuff but plenty of fresh fruit to start the day. This hotel is located within a business district so most restaurants were a couple miles away."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"It is a new building and close to expressways. The suite layout is a nice change from the usual hotel room and there is enough space to stretch out. Here are the couple things that bothered me, and dropped the rating from Very Good to Average: First, the A/C unit was REALLY loud, which I was surprised at due to how recent the place was built. I've heard much quieter units in older Hampton Inn's, so was someone trying to save a buck? Second, the hotel allows smoking in many rooms on the top floor. Isn't that where the most rewarded guests are usually placed? I don't know why hotels still allow smoking, but those rooms should be in the least desirable places, not the top floor. </DOC> This hotel was great for my family while in town for a three day swim meet. Kids were well rested for their races and the rooms were spacious enough for them to spread out. The kitchens were nice so we didn't have to eat out every meal. Free warm breakfast were great. </DOC> stayed here several times now, as an alternative to the willowbrook location. Slighter better both good, bit only 1 restaurant with walking difference whereas willowbrook has many. drive 500 yards though and there are lots. </DOC> This was my second stay at the Homewood Suites while working in the area. It accessible off a main highway exit and a short drive to a busy area with restaurants and shopping areas. There's a local BBQ place right next store where you can also order take out and bring back to the hotel. It can be a little tricky to get in and out with construction in the area. The rooms are designed for extended stays so they are very comfortable with full serve kitchen areas. It's a Hilton property to accessing internet is always tricky though a free service is available. A full breakfast is included though a 7:00 start time didn't accommodate early weekend schedules. Room rate with taxes was about $115 a night. There are other hotel options in the area so check prices if you are looking for a better deal. </DOC> Pleasantly surprised. As a rule I am not a fan of chain hotels in the USA, typically they lack character and intimacy, however the Homewood suites was a really good hotel. First the complimentary breakfast, although not a massive choice, was good quality, constantly stocked and fresh. the rooms are large suites, with complimentary wifi allowing all my devices to connect at the same time. Typically kitted out with full kitchen area, living area, large bathroom (shower only). and very little disturbance from the corridors. Monday to Friday a buffet style complementary dinner with free beers / wines are also available, and inclusive in the rate. Staff were friendly. Overall enjoyed my stay, and will stay here next time in the area. </DOC> The room was a suite with separate kitchenette, small dining area and living area, definitely more than enough space for a family of 2 adults and 1 or 2 kids. I stayed here for 3 nights alone and it was more than enough space for me. There is nothing much to do around the area but I chose it for my own purposes. It is located near a freeway intersection but far enough away so that I could not hear any traffic noise during my stay. Tip: try to Goode Company BBQ restaurant located right next door! </DOC> For the most part my stay here has been good. The location wouldn't be bad if it weren't for the 290 traffic and construction. The hotel staff has been very friendly and welcoming. They have a great general manager who visits with everyone and takes the time to get to know you. The hotel it self looks a bit older. The decor seems to be a bit out dated. The staff makes up for the issues. </DOC> If you have a need to stay in the CY-Fair area of Houston then this is your only choice. Every other hotel in the area has bad reviews, charges too much or is in a bad area. Homewood Suites is one of the nicest properties I have ever stayed. The rooms are quite large with a full kitchen and sitting room along with great comfortable beds. The complimentary breakfast is very well done and offers a full breakfast not just the normal quickie stuff. The front desk if very accomodating and friendly. I would definitely stay here again!"

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'So, this hotel had a decent price and I tried to save a little money for my employer. Location is a little out of the way, and not much to eat around the area that wasn\'t fast food. I drove quite a way to find something, but came back to stay the night. Staff was nice, lobby is nice, but the rooms are pretty outdated. That\'s fine I can deal with that, as I am sure renovations go through marriotts in cycles. Crazy thing was that I woke up and opened the blind to see that a car was sitting on all its rims. Someone had come and stolen someone\'s tires, completely. I called the front desk to let them know and it seemed like not a shock, something that might happen often. That let me know that this won\'t be a place I stay again. </DOC> We needed a hotel after a household emergency so after a good experience 3 years ago when we put our wedding guests here I thought of this place. I\'m a member of Marriotts reward program so a great rate $75/nt + tax. On arrival we found major upgrades since before. room far improved and the bistro was great. I\'m not a fan of hotel food but this was great ,too much really. Roasted Brussel sprouts, tomato soup + toasted cheese sandwiches + quessadillas shared between 2. all for $40. A great experience. Only down side was road noise from I610. We requested quiet room and could have been located further from highway so 1 star removed for that. Give it a try </DOC> Very helpful, pleasant and patient staff make the difference here. The room was quite clean and the bed comfortable, but I certainly would like better light in the bathroom for putting on makeup. Television very fussy, insisted it wasn\'t getting a signal for several minutes after turning it on, and finally a change of channel helped.And why are luggage racks not automatically in a room? No coffee in lobby except from the Sbux outlet, unfortunately, but once there was cold water and cookies by the front desk. Lots of help from the staff for an emergency run to pick up a couple of things at a drugstore, smiling faces, accurate information and no feeling of "Well, they\'ve learned the corporate script." Slept really well though. </DOC> Two nights and cannot wait to check out. Staff super sweet, and clean BUT you can clearly hear your neighbors on both sides and above you. Not just where they are walking but their conversations as well as their tv\'s. People aren\'t being loud they are conducting themselves normally. The construction of the walls is horrible!!!! I am on the 2nd floor, it\'s sold out or I would request to move. The traffic is busy and my room is in the back of the hotel so I can hear the traffic very well. Good location if you can get past the high inside and outside noise level. </DOC> We stayed here for 2 nights and didn\'t get a key that actually worked until the 2nd evening. The hotel was installing a new key system and it wasn\'t working. Some rooms were fine and others weren\'t working. Evidently the week before we arrived, it was worse per the front desk staff. They did give me their phone number for the front desk so that whenever they attempted to give us a working key,two or three times a day, we could call and someone would come up to let us in. Not convenient! The front desk staff was very nice and friendly in the face of all the complaining from the locked out guests. Definitely get a room on the inside of the hotel, not one facing the 610 Loop - very noisy. </DOC> Nice location. Didn\'t hear any road noise. Good construction, couldn\'t hear other rooms. Nicely maintained facility. Definitely recommend. Good fitness center. Nice courtyard for relaxing. Love the colors in the cafe. Rooms are comfortable with fridges and big tv\'s. </DOC> Its an avg hotel. Nothing special. I was not crazy about the location, Room was clean and bed was nice. Bar closed way to early. The people were very friendly. Lots of parking and close to the freeway. </DOC> I stayed for business and we had a business dinner. In the morning I looked out the back of the breakfast area and saw this incredible outdoor pool with umbrellas and deck chairs. I thought I was in Orlando! That was my one regret--not kicking back out there. The rooms are very large, internet works fine, classy. I\'ve stayed here before and this is where I stay in Houston. Staff is very friendly. Surface (free) parking.'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"Friendly staff, clean rooms and close to where I need to be. Always recognized as a return member (unlike several La Quinta's). Room was spotless, quiet and comfortable. Air conditioner was on and at a comfortable temp so no having to wait for the room to cool down. Bed was very comfortable and breakfast was good as always. A great place to stay! </DOC> Took my visiting Aunt to the airport a day early due to the possibility of an ice storm. A little mix up in the reservations but was taken care of. I have stayed at this hotel several times and have never been disappointed in the check in, room, breakfast or my stay. I like the fact is next to a convenience store with a small Burger King so if you need something you can just walk over. One of the best around IAH! </DOC> Easy hotel to get to after a day of flying and even on the way back home as well! Room was clean as always and service was very efficient. This time I was upgraded to a larger room which was really nice and had a nice big TV as well, along with a couch and two chairs as well along with the desk chair. Breakfast was great as always! </DOC> This is one of the few hotels I stay at when flying in or out of IAH, or even just a trip to Houston so I review it every time I stay. From check in to check out everything is taken care of promptly and with a smile. Breakfast is ready on time and the room is always clean and quiet. </DOC> Very good stay, super close to airport and they have shuttle! Nicely decorated ,spacious room, comfortable bed, good size restroom, all very clean! continental breakfast could of been better otherwise no complaintes at al! </DOC> I have stayed at this hotel several times in the past and each time it feels like home when I arrive. Friendly staff behind the desk, and the room is always clean, fresh and comfortable. Hotel is on the east side of the airport, close enough after a long day of travel (and flight delays) to come in and relax. There is not really any restaurant close by other than a fast food place, but it is also not that far from FM 1960 and US 59 where there are tons of places, or you can do as I do and order in pizza! The store next door sells beer so instant dinner. </DOC> Front desk staff were great. Drawbacks, found a toenail in between the sheets and dirt in corners of bathroom makes me wonder if the room had really been cleaned before we arrived, also slamming doors all night long, and breakfast was a bit lame. Unfortunately, i cant give the hotel very high marks </DOC> I recently was traveling and in a 2 week time frame had 3 separate bookings. Each and every stay was handled perfectly! The staff was welcoming and friendly with each check in. The points program made the check in and out seamless. The airport shuttle was timely and available on my schedule. Internet was free and speedy. My room was clean and comfortable. The only negative is the location is not near shopping or restaurants (just a Burger King in walking distance) but there are numerous restaurants that deliver to the hotel."

SUMMARY:  b'Marvellous and i would definitely stay here again if you are in the area and needed a hotel close to the airport but the front desk was very helpful and informative .room was clean and comfortable with a comfy bed ( not a single bed ) but certainly more than adequate breakfast was great</DOC>'

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"We stayed for 1 night and paid \xc2\xa324.50, excellent value. In common with a previous reviewer, we had also read some of the other reviews but had none of their experiences! Friendly welcome from receptionist who also said to contact her if we had any questions, problems or wanted information. Our room was on the ground floor (108) at the back. Lots of free parking. There was no traffic noise even though A12 very close. Room was fine, furnishings a bit old and shabby but all comfortable and very clean. Tea/coffee making facilities, individual shampoos, shower gels and moisturisers. We didn't eat at the hotel. We walked to nearest bus stop (about 20 minutes) and got day tickets for \xc2\xa31.80 each. Pavements all the way and lighting apart from 1 small patch. We would stay here again, </DOC> Having read some pretty damning reviews I wasn't looking forward to staying at the Dragonfly. Spent Saturday evening there. It's a good budget hotel, nicer than a Premier Inn/Travelodge and not as expensive. Friendly staff, good size rooms, nothing at all to complain about. Really good value. I'll go back! </DOC> Booked with a Buy a Gift voucher and it was supposed to be a luxury hotel - which it definitely wasn't! The room was very basic but the bed was comfortable and it was clean. Expected a view of the lake - perhaps from the dining room but the photos are taken from the other side of the road and you can't see the lake from the hotel. Dining room has no atmosphere and the food was very poor. Luckily found The Crown which was walking distance and had a great menu so ate there the second night. The scrambled eggs were inedible at breakfast - just a solid lump you had to slice and bacon was very overcooked. Don't eat here if you can help it! </DOC> Stayed here for a night for business. The room was a good size although quite tired and dated. The carpet was quite worn in places and the bathroom was in need of an update and deep clean. The breakfast was self serve, it was a good selection and plentiful, although the hot trays were very hard to open as they were greasy and had very little handles. The staff were pleasant and helpful. The car park was of a decent size. </DOC> We stayed for 2 nights on a buyagift deal. Our room was comfortable and had everything we needed. The breakfast was good too with fresh fruit and cooked breakfast. We must have had a happy cook on the second day as we had double portions for our breakfast .Free fast wifi too even in the bedrooms. However it could do with a little attention. We had to reconnect the shower tube when we got there and the TV had been switched off by a switch hidden behind the flat screen.The carpet around the bar could do with being replaced too. But it was in a handy position if you could find it without going down the A12 for 8 miles having missed the turn, it was good value. </DOC> The staff here are lovely and I feel sorry for them having to work in this dirty, damaged building. Jupiter Management group must have contempt for their guests and staff if they think this is an acceptable place to run. The carpet and furnishings in my room were stained, broken or burnt. The mould on the bathroom shower curtain smelled so strong that I started to wheeze. The bedding was clean and the bed was reasonably comfortable but it made my skin crawl to step out of bed and onto the carpet because it was so stained. The food is edible but very overpriced and the bar area is so grimy that you would have to be very drunk not to notice. </DOC> It is nearly two years since my last visit here and I must say it has improved massively over this time. Rooms are immaculate, nice new fresh look and very clean. Restaurant is nice and modern, although I didn\xe2\x80\x99t eat the food looked good and decent value. Plenty of parking with no issues if you register your vehicle on arrival. Very good value for an overnight stay. </DOC> The hotel is located conveniently for main routes. This enables visitors to explore the area for sights and shopping. The hotel is in need of redecoration and an injection of 21st century friendly amenities but it is good value for money."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"I have been to this hotel many times. We think it is excellent value. We always have a superior room which has two large double beds and a fridge. The food is varied and good. Location is excellent with nearby bus stops with frequent service. Buy a card which will enable journeys to be made at a reduced price. Rooms clean, towels changed daily and bed changed after three days. Mix of international guests. Any request to reception was promptly and efficiently handled. </DOC> We stayed at the Hotel Best Siroco for 2 night in March 2019 as part of a road trip . The hotel was easy to find and there was parking at the front. The surrounding area and the resort was busy considering the time of year. The check in process was good and we were upgraded to the premium rooms which was a nice surprise. The rooms were modern and clean. We had breakfast as part of the room rate and it was fine and buffet style . No issues at all with the hotel which was well located in the resort . I would happily stay again at this hotel. </DOC> Following dreadful reviews on here, we went to the hotel expecting to have a nightmare of what was originally a cheapish family holiday. Apart from vomming at the thought of having another buffet or the sight of another baguette..it was a fantastic 3* hotel. Would deffo pay extra for a quieter and roomier superior room....although u can't really get any kippage until the entertainment finishes at midnight...some of it made was cheesy central, other nights were very very funny/ entertaining.. good, something for everyone...pool quite crowded an a little on the small side but generally a perfect family hotel* l </DOC> I stayed at this hotel again on the 14th of May to the 28th, we upgraded to a superior room with a view of the swimming pool, room was nice and large and the staff were friendly and helpful. I am disabled and in a wheelchair and high a mobility scooter for my stay there. The hotel reception made my stay more enjoyable by giving us access to the garage so my husband did not have to walk up the hill. We will return again next year </DOC> This hotel is one street back from the front and the main road from which you can catch a bus easily. Trips to Malaga and fuengirolla only cost 1.65 euros, absolutely brilliant. You can also walk, bus or taxi to the cable car, market or park, all well worth a visit. The hotel itself is a bit tired but the staff more than make up for it. Very attentive and helpful and they still are able to smile despite being full. Food was very good Xmas and new year but in between was quite indifferent. Breakfast was very good but served Spanish style, which tends to be cool, however there are microwaves to reheat it. Only managed one lunch and that was very good. </DOC> Should be one star if lucky ...food appaling , but one star for gardens ...rooms 20 years out of date and nned total refurb....most stank of smoke ....avoid </DOC> We stayed at this hotel for Christmas and New Year, it says in the brochere on a slight hill and not suitable for the less mobile, I am disabled and in a wheelchair but did hire a mobility scooter so I could go to more places. Food was good, staff very friendly, rooms nice and clean, the only thing missing for us was the tea and coffee making facilites and the fridge. We are so happy with the hotel that we are going again in May this year and hopefully Christmas again. </DOC> Just back from siroco hotel , very very clean everybody friendly & helpful,we upgraded our room worth it for the view, lovely gardens in front of hotel , few mosquitoes about but didn't really bother us.The breakfasts were very good but evening meal so so, seemed to cater more for the Spanish who were very much in the majority, not so many English staying. We went out on the buses a lot very cheap if you buy a pass from any tobacco shop, wifi is non existent in the hotel whatever the management say, but most bars etc roundabout will let you connect."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b"Stayed here for one night. it's a newer Fairfield inn. The rooms were spacious and clean. Beds were comfortable. The lobby was great with a nice breakfast. The people were very friendly. Good location. No complaints. </DOC> Nice new building, tiny pool, so-so front desk staff, breakfast above average. Overall, just a very average *new* hotel. -negatives -Ask for extra blankets, our room had one very thin one on the bed, and no extras in the closet. -a/c unit didn't work all that well, felt really humid in the room at all times -shower had plenty of mildew -water is extremely hard -Had to get both room keys reprogrammed twice -had to ask for front desk service, as the guy working didn't seem too interested in leaving whatever he was playing on the computer in the lobby -our room was missing the latch/strike plate on the door, so it didn't shut tight, and rattled anytime someone else shut a door or walked by Overall, not impressed for it being a new facility. </DOC> Stayed here and wrote a review in 2012; had a less than desirable experience. Decided to give it another chance in 2013, and it was much improved. The only real issue I had this time, was still the staff. They are not very friendly or accommodating. The facility and stay itself, were fine. If we're back in New Braunfels again, we'd probably stay here again, over others in the area. </DOC> This hotel is located adjacent to I-35 about thirty miles northeast of San Antonio. This property was full of vacationing families when I visited in late August. The property was in good condition. Breakfast is a standard continental offering, but free. My room was comfortable and set up with a large walk-in shower, not a bath. This property is only ten (10) minutes from nearby Seguin. I would stay here again. </DOC> If you need to do a lot of things in New Braunfels or shopping in San Marcos - very nice hotel to stay. They have a few nice double suites if someone needs the extra space like I tend to, staff was super friendly, hotel clean and organized. Full breakfast to enjoy as well. I will be returning for sure </DOC> This hotel is one of the nicest hotels I have stayed at. It was very clean and modern. The staff was great and very helpful. Checking in and out was easy, along with emails of confirmation and final receipt. Towels and bed were clean. Breakfast was good, I love that they had cooked oatmeal not instant pack. I would defiantly recommend this hotel if you are in the area. </DOC> Very nice stay for the price. Clean & well maintained rooms and public spaces. Great front desk staff, kudos to April for all her friendly recommendations! The free breakfast is pretty standard fare but filling and replenished frequently. Would stay here again! </DOC> I really liked this hotel. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The rooms were nicely decorated and it was a very good stay. I really liked the indoor pool and Jacuzzi as well. Everybody that worked there was polite and went out of their way to make my stay a great one."

ORIGINAL REVIEWS:  b'We had a fine stay. room was nice and clean. Location is difficult to find at first but once you find it, you will be fine.Hotel has a nice outdoor pool and Jacuzzi. Hotel has a full bar. Bartender was cordial. Many choices of restaurants within a 5 mile radius. The Woodlands has an area that has some higher end eateries if you choose. Wal Mart just down the road if you need any items. We always buy some beverages and snacks to save on expenses. We would stay at this location again when in Houston. </DOC> Easy check in, nice modern decor. Bar in the lobby. Nice fire pit area outside as well. The staff was friendly and helpful. The only drawback was how close the hotel is to the interstate. It is very loud. I would suggest asking for a low floor on the side of the hotel away from the highway. </DOC> Stayed at this hotel for the first time this week. This hotel is so new they had room key that touch the lock and it automatically opens. Everyone in this hotel was very friendly from check in to the smiling worker in their breakfast buffet. I was offered directions to local restaurants and all in all this was a very nice stay. When I am in town again I will stay here. </DOC> I was concerned about road noise as this sits on I-45 but it was not a problem. Our room was on the highway side, ground floor and there was just a "hum" of road noise in the background. It\'s all new and a friendly staff. There\'s no restaurant on property but several nearby. </DOC> Stayed here 1 night on a business trip to Texas. The room was spacious and clean with a sitting/desk area and a nice bathroom with good brand-name toiletries. The breakfast was free and good. Coffee is also free all morning long. Staff courteous and helpful. I also thought the fitness center was very good and kept at a properly cool temperature which is a bit of an issue with hotels, I find. There\'s a bar which is fun but it closes at 10. The only thing that was an issue is that there\'s a little noise from the highway, I recommend turning on the fan/AC (not a problem in Tx!) to drown out the noise. Worked fine for me. There\'s a big shopping center nearby which people may find convenient. </DOC> I stayed at the SpringHill Suites in The Woodlands one weekend in June. The service was impecable. I wish I could remember the names of all the staff members that were so pleasant and accommodating! The bartender brought us out samples of a fruit slush while we were at the pool. The suites are big, clean, and nice. It\'s not a very big hotel in general, but it still is great. The pool is small but on the bright side there is a lot privacy to it. And it had the usual things you might expect... weight room, great breakfast, free internet, free parking. It was a nice little in-town get away for me. :-) </DOC> We flew into the Houston Intercontinental airport (IAH) and arrived at the hotel around 10 PM. Unfortunately I did not call to let them know we would be checking in late so we did not get a suite that we requested. We requested the 4th floor away from the traffic noise. What was left when we arrived was the 3rd floor facing I-45, room 361. It was very noisy so the next morning we requested a room change. Thankfully they moved us to 458 for the second night and we got a great nights sleep. Tip: If you are going to check in after 5 or 6 pm, call the hotel and let them know you are still coming. There is lots of shopping and restaurants nearby. The staff was wonderful and we enjoyed the many amenities that Springhill Suites offers; spacious rooms, soft towels, free WiFi, expanded continental breakfast. </DOC> I liked the fact to have microwaves and mini fidges in the suites, the hotel was really clean and the staff were extremely friendly in my short 2 days stay here, I enjoyed their breakfast nothing different just like any other hotel with good belgian waffles, good scrambled eggs and good coffee. The hotel is in a quiet place so you can relax and no really any noise from outside cars or people. Good soundproof from the rooms we did not hear anyone else next door, recommended for families, friends or just to stay from work as we did...excellent.'
