        "docs": "instead of fighting the crowds we got coffee right across the street on the corner .our room was what you would expect in a hampton and a hilton property , we had a very nice view of the citadel from the 14th floor .oura conveniently located hotel in downtown halifax close to the citadel and waterfront .however the hotel is impossible to recommend based on our experience .we would come back here if ever we return to halifax . </DOC> we were there mid week , i ca n't imagine a busy weekend .the pool seemed fine , if small , and the fitness centre was ok with more than the minimum pieces of equipment .the best part about both of these hotels is they are right by the citadelso if you are a tourist , you can see that early of late or when it is convenient .also it makes the hotel pretty easy to find . </DOC> dry happy to stay there again .i could have paid twice as much to be down on the harbor ( marriott ) , but the hampton inn has the best combination of cost and location .most of what you want to visit is within an easy walk ( as long as you do n\u2019t mind hills ) .the view was disappointing , offering only a small slice of the harbor , but we liked the light and the great bathroom .actually , it was the largest seating area for breakfast that i have ever seen in a hampton inn . </DOC> the hotel is located in the downtown area on the halifax side , just a bit up the hill from the river on the north end of downtown .the hotel actually overlooks the halifax citadel , at least for those on the south or west side of the hotel .good location for access to restaurants and some key destinations .the bathroom was large and functional , with a large walk - in shower .this gave us great views of halifax harbour and the downtown area . </DOC> this is a very nice location in halifax .nice views of the city . located very close to some nice restaurants and pubs .would definitely come back either for business or for vacation .coffee service is poorly set - up -- add a 2nd station , and put stacks of cups in multiple places at each station so that you can more readily be getting your coffee while a 2nd person is ' doctoring ' theirs , and a 2rd person can be making tea .parking process is clunky -- put up clear signs where the elevator is and look at improving card key access . </DOC> the hotel location is good although a bit of a walk to the waterfront .a helpful hint for other travelers , move your car to an area outside of the parking garage before checking out as your room key is needed to get access to the parking garage .i found the rates to be pricey but its pretty well normal for any down town halifax hotel .the hampton was in a great location and close to many amenities ( citadel , casino , scotia place , clubs and restaurants ) .guests do not receive free parking . </DOC> the room was very large for the price paid , the common areas were also large and inviting and the location is central to everything in downtown halifax .highly recommend this property .2queen beds , very modern and clean on site launderette central to all sitesclean . convenient to everything in town .a 20-minute walk to the heart of the wharf ( 3 - 4 long blocks downhill ) . </DOC> front desk could not give us good directions to near - by restaurants , which i thought was rather unusual .",
