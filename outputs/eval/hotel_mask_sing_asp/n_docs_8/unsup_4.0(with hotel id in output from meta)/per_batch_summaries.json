        "docs": "the fitness center is excellent , well maintained , and clean .very luxurious . excellent service .the rooms are spacious and clean . walking distance to excellent shopping and restaurants .the rooms were good sized , well decorated and clean and service was very friendly .the room was a typical large american hotel room with a balcony which i would n't let my kids out on as it was way too high up ! </DOC> an awkward room layout - could n't open the door all the way and exit while standing behind it - walls in the way .the room was very spacious and had a balcony with an awesome view of the beach .it is an older style hotel but the rooms are very large .whilst the bathrooms are a little dated they are more than adequate .the rooms themselves are quite large but </DOC> room could not have been nicer . </DOC> this is a very nice hotel .we were very specific in stating that we needed a king sized bed .when we opened the door & saw the 2 double beds i immediately called back to the desk .as has been mentioned many times the views from these rooms is wonderful .but we were lucky and had relatively quiet neighbours only one loud late night </DOC> the common areas and rooms feel very dated and the elevators to get to and from your room can be very slow .house keeping did a pretty good job by taping the door gap which helps somewhat .wow what a large room .too large - big areas between the furniture .i noticed lots of surface mounted electrical ducting running along the walls but no outlet . </DOC> disappointed with the rooms we paid for as we where a family of 4 with a joining rooms paid for 4 beds and got a put me up bed .it is a beautiful hotel with nicely appointed and modern rooms .new rooms are very nice , but could have done without the old tub and shower curtain ..we received a free upgrade and had a lovely spacious ocean facing room .bathroom was very dated but room was nice and very clean . </DOC> the room itself was fairly nice .it was well appointed and decently large .rooms are pretty standard ( 2 towers ) .hot tub is big and warm .room was a really good size . </DOC> hyatt waikiki beach resort went through a complete room renovation about 1 - 2 years ago , so all the rooms are completely updated , new carpet , furniture and bathrooms .electric japanese style toilets .rooms are bright , has a 1950s revival but beachy feel .the rooms are fine .they were updated a few years ago and are holding up quite nice .",
