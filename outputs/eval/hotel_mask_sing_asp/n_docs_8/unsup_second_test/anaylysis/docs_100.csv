0,"overall we had a very pleasant staystayed 2 nights on business great welcome , friendly staff , lovely room , great facilities , ample parking , wi - fi , great price , great location .nothe bar is soulless , the food ordinary , and service not great ... for example our foreign waiter did not know what english mustard was !my chips on the sunday evening were re - heated from the look and taste ... in contrast to the following evening dining there when the chips were hot and fresh and crispy .the hotel is lovely as are the staff . </DOC> this is a very well run hotel from efficient check in through to room cleanliness and all the choice of food offered .the staff encountered were all pleasant and knowledgeable about the surrounding area .so i think the receptionists much get constant calls about missing towels .choice was good and the receptionists very nice .the staff were professional and helpful . </DOC> i eat in the bar and had breakfast all good , staff very nice and professionalthey have really good family roomspaul the manager was exceptionally professional and set a high standard that his staff followed .the reception staff were friendly and extremely helpful .dinner - food was very nice </DOC> we paid for our drinks and sat down .it was at least 20 minutes before the table was cleaned by a female member of staff whose demeanour was not good .at breakfast , we waited 15 minutes for our hot food order to be taken , and diners arriving after us were served first .our cooked breakfast finally arrived 40 minutes after we had sat down .i only had a bar snack , but it was very poor quality , service was ok "" just "" </DOC> positive : - large and pleasant rooms - allows you to book one night only in the weekend - very friendly service in the bar restaurantthere is an issue about the price / quality ratio - this hotel is probably above average for the lake district meaning its prices are a bit lower - but to clarify for overseas visitors - that does not mean the prices are in relationship to what you get -this is a very nice hotel , but our experience was spoilt by problems that should never have occurred .the restaurant was closed for the season , and we had to dine in the bar .inevitably , this rather chaotic ' system ' resulted in the bar being full to capacity and we were extremely fortunate that a table became vacant . </DOC> they tried hard but made it feel like faulty towers ., i went down stairs to see if there was a larger one , there was but would cost an extra ¬£ 15 a night , which i paid .i went to recption , the receptionist said i would have to pay for the second night , i pointed out the cancellation policy, she said i would have to contact late rooms , which i did .they phoned the hotel . </DOC> although not recommended by hotel we stayed at , we found this hotel to be great ., staff were very friendly and helpful , especially jacky , and the food was really good .lovely ambiance and surroundings , good selection of food and helpful pleasant service .the food and service there were excellent , especially the lamb curry ., food is good in the bar . </DOC> we had breakfast both mornings which was very good , and ate dinner there one night which was equally very good , if a little expensive .the restaurant service was good , but it did lack in atmosphere .and so that has not affected the service to guests travelling independently .we always use the swimming pool , enjoy dinner and an excellent breakfast .it took somewhere around five attempts for the spanish waitress to understand my order ."
1,"and we were extremely happy with this hotel .the food at both , the restaurant and the bar was good , the service was excellent and all the staff were extremely polite and helpful .good choice of both english and continental breakfasts .it started from the excellent receptionist 's friendly and efficient greeting - they rang shortly after we 'd arrived to check the roombreakfast was again very efficient , courteous and filling . </DOC> the food was pub standard and was n't worth half of what we paid for it .breakfast was good staff at breakfast less so .the receptionist was friendly and efficient .we also enjoyed breakfast which again was the usual options and was served by attentive staff .we were not disappointed , the hotel is clean and comfortable , the service is good and the food is of a good standard . </DOC> the list of deficiencies is endless and i do n't want to go on .thanks for reading .the check in was smooth , and the room nice enough .when we reported this to reception at check outbut at a premier inn ( their beds are always great ) </DOC> this was good in some respectsand but the atmosphere was poor .we opted to eat in - a very pleasant meal .the receptionist was very friendly and very helpfull .radiator cold . complained at reception and was told someone would be down . </DOC> 45 minutes later still nothing .went back to reception and the guy followed me back ( inc ironing board ) .at night bar food excellent .no - one around . helped myself and then a chinese guy appeared to tell me to sit in the tour area .told him i was not on the tour . </DOC> check out was fine , clerk told me that this hotel has xmas parties on from 1st dec to 7th jan ..the staff were all really friendly and went out of their way to be helpful - eg .far from being annoyed , the staff went out of their way to sort the problem out and were really friendly about it . </DOC> arrived at 2 for a speedy check in , nice looking hotel , slightly dated around the edges .the staff were all very friendly and the location was very good allowing us easy access to the north of the lakes .breakfast was very good with all sorts of choices on offer . </DOC> check in at reception was efficient and the receptionist very pleasant .the bar was really nice and the bar man very pleasant .the staff were so friendly especially the lovely jacqui .they gave us an excellent large room .desk / restaurant staff were excellent ."
2,"breakfast a bit iffy but the friendliness of the staff made up for it .dinner in the bistro was excellent .the waiter brings bread but the designated amount is one half slice per person .so it looked a bit sad .breakfast was also good --- smoked haddock and poached eggs for 2 days running --- quite a luxury </DOC> on my second breakfast i thought i would try the haddock and poached egg .i was so disappointed when it camewish i had ordered a full english breakfast .we had a problem getting into our room when the lock failed and we had to wait 20 mins while they changed the battery .the service was either excellent or terrible depending on who you got . </DOC> when i arrived i was given what i would call a difficult time by the receptionist that had a zero sense of humourso our start was nothing but poor .dinner - we decided to eat in the bar rather than the formal restaurant .a fairly good selection of better standard "" pub "" food and all 4 guests were happy with our meal and the overall cost .this bar also has a very good wine selection . </DOC> we were on a one night b & b stopover and ate in the bar where the food and service was good - the dining room offered a ¬£ 25 table d'hote 3 course menu with limited choices .was excellent and a free bottle of wine from the manager was a nice touchno walk in shower andbreakfast was okdinner lacked charm , quality and english speaking waiters . </DOC> but it did nt ruin my visit , i had a great time .the leisure facilities are apparently also to be upgraded in the near future , but even as they are they are pretty good .food and restaurant service was very good , though we found the portions a little large at times .service is good throughout and the bar food is reasonable value .food was average nothing special . </DOC> all the staff are truly hospitable from the receptionists , restaurant , leisure centre to the superb service in the bar where zach worked with a friendly attitude towards his customers and service of both food and drink .staff were friendly and helpful . would be happy to return to this hotel next time we are in the area .in restaurant so got to choose my table , service was ok , staff friendly , choice slightly strange , no steak on menu .food was at best ok , duck waswhen i went to sign bill , told there was no credit </DOC> check in was very bad .we were directed in the wrong direction for our room .there were stairs which no pre - warned us about or offered to help with .on mentioning at check out "" i amvery sorry "" room service menu was out of date </DOC> the staff were friendly and efficient also .the room was very comfortable , the staff were very friendly .stayed here for a second time , still as nice .food was lovely and staff helpful and friendly .breakfast was lovely üëç"
3,"when i checked my dinner bill i 'd been charged for 2 drinks in the bar that were n't mine , another 5 minute wait to get that cleared up .however at breakfast praise to the morning staff who were very willing and able .really friendly staff and restaurant food was good , although the menu is not particularly extensive nor exciting .the restaurant has an imaginative menu , good food and friendly service .we complained and after a very brief initial discussion they changed us to a fantastic room with great views and a 4 poster . </DOC> receptionist was a pleasure to deal with - welcoming , friendly and efficient , a real credit to the place .my experience of the reception & bar staff was of them all being people from the local area who were pleasant , happy to help and accommodating .whilst the quality of food was excellent on one night , the same meal on our third night was just not up to the level of our first night .the level of cleaning could have been better ie : attention to detail not what it should be , we had to ask for our wastebin to be emptied ( from the previous occupant . ) not very nice !the only person that deserves a mention is katrin , she goes out of her way to make you feel valued . </DOC> she is now the matre ' d but has an interest in what her clients are feeling about the rest of the hotel services .it 's very good .however , their leisure facilities are not earning any brownie points .members of the club were splashing cold water about in order for the thermostat to kick in or were leaving the door open to get it to work !is still not working despite promises from the owner that it would be fixed . </DOC> again no apology from the receptionist but a very pleasant house keeper arrived almost immediately with towels and loo paper - also told us the second set of towels were in a bottom drawer of a cupboard ! !out i apologised to the same receptionists that we did not find the towels earlier - no reaction .we enjoyed our stay , and food in the bar was good , and reasonably priced - allbreakfasts were good too .i had bar food which was enjoyable and tasty gym , pool . </DOC> empty words : you still wait 10 minutes for steam and when it eventually does arrive it cooks you .no use complaining , nothing gets done .but they are n't bothered .management - please note that firm mattresses are only for very heavy people and whilst you may have wanted to invest in a mattress that would last for years , you ' ve exchanged longevity for comfort .i have to admit that there are different answers to the same question depending on who you ask - receptionist says version a , bar staff version b </DOC> and they are contradictory ... if you need help , try with various staff members .maybe more training required so hotel policy is equally known to all ?bar meal left a lot to be desired , not very nice at all , service extremely slow and had to go in search of seating for tables with no chairs .staff were very helpful .however service at breakfast was a lot better . </DOC> the receptionist was polite , professional and informative .the check in staff were really happy and helpful which was a nice start .but then it will have been thrown , hand wash more efficient ( attached to the wall ) .the hotel has undergone major refurbishment and as a result appears on the surface to be very plesant indeed .the staff are warm and friendly , the bar area is inviting and the food is excellent . </DOC> as well as a main restaurant you can eat in the bar , the menu is varied and reasonable priced .the presentation was good , the downside was the tuna steak was overcooked and the pastry top to the steak & ale pie was cooked separately , service was not great but the poor guy was on his own doing everything !reception staff were friendly and helpful , showing me personally to my spacious suite ( room 23 ) , which had a separate seating area and connection doors to the bedroom .when she complained she was told that the chef was n't very good at eggs !the next morning the forty minute wait was reduced to thirty but the restaurant was full so we were shunted off on our own to another room ."
4,"if you can get a deal this is a good place to stay .the hotel is used by golfing parties and for wedding receptions/ civil weddings , so it can get very busy and expect a disco in a function room .second night we had a meal in the restaurant , very enjoyable .from the moment we arrived at the reception we were greeted by very pleasant and informative receptionist , who explained all of the facilities and services of the hotel .very relaxing dining room for our evening meal , which was faultless as was the excellent service . </DOC> the staff are all helpful and very courteous without exceptionstaff were very helpful and friendly .we were told that there were not many booked in ( true ) so the chef sent out all they had prepared ...the bar is ok , business travelers so not exactly ' cosy ' , and the usual bar prices for a place in the middle of no - where with no competition .all the staff were really cheerful , pleasant and polite . </DOC> staff are good .dinner and breakfast were cheap and good quality .the staff were friendly and helpful .i was very happy when the hotel allowed us an early checkand yes great food served - from friendly and efficient young staff . </DOC> the restaurant was rowdy and staff were clearly uncomfortable .breakfast like a school canteen .the reception was good and we were in our rooms very quickly .also the request to put all drinks on one room did not workthe staff are friendly but again the reception areas are a bit dated . </DOC> all that said , a reasonably pleasant and peaceful place to stay .the reception staff were pleasant and helpful .it has a small and friendly feel to it with simple food .golf course was in magnificent condition and a joy to play , staff always friendly and willing to help .i was very happy that our room had been upgraded . </DOC> the choices were good and all food excellent , plenteous and excellent quality .excellent menu catering for all tastes .the service was given in a friendly and most helpful way .as always we found all the staff friendly , professional and efficient .the food was great quality , well presented and a varied menu . </DOC> stayed dec 9th , staff very friendly , and the superior rooms are good quality , with free bottled water , and excelent amenities .this was limited , but the bar staff helped with a vfm choice .stayed here as had a meeting in leicester , check in was very friendly and efficient , the evening dinner , both good and service was excellent as was breakfastdespite the few problems i have booked again as the food , service and comfortable bed more than made up for the problems .tea , coffee , biscuits and waters in the room are very welcoming . </DOC> the restaurant food and service were of high quality , but we were disappointed that diners were allowed to eat in shorts during dinner .reception staff were friendly , and inviting as per usual .the staff are very helpful and friendly .the reception ladies were most welcoming , . remembered my wife 's first name and handed us a card from the best western group .the service throughout was excellent and the waiting staff were most friendly ."
5,"business as ever for me and after a busy days driving check in was smooth and with very welcoming staff .the service was fine and the food typical pub fare .sleep was fine other than the banging door and the breakfast buffet was pretty good with lovely coffee ( and tablecloths ! ! ) .we did not feel rushed at all and our young waiter was excellent .we were booked in very efficiently by a pleasant young lady and told how to find our room . </DOC> very polite and welcoming reception staff .arrived late evening still ample parking and welcomed by reception staff .they surve typical english food there : sunday roast , english breakfast etc .checked in late , after 11 pm , good service and clean and tidy hotel , will use again when in the area on business .staff friendly and helpful </DOC> the check in is always efficient & friendly , as are all the staff .the reception staff were lovely and friendly and very efficient on arrival .we enjoyed a function at the golf club , staff on the bar were not very friendy .the staff were amazing , starters lovely carvery lovely and fresh and veg just perfect . loved the fact veg was not kept under heat lamps and pudstaff were polite and friendly with plenty of rooms for meetings etc . </DOC> a complimentary upgrade to a double was a pleasant surprise .i had dinner in the bar , as i was on my own , and both food and service were good ......from the moment we arrived and were greeted by the friendly staff at reception and to our lovely roomthis is a great hotel , v clean , really welcoming staff and great beds .- keep up the good work , we will be back </DOC> wo n't be going back as there are plenty of places in the area serving better food , value and service .decor good enough , plenty of space and service from staff very good also .staff were well trained and all very courteous .the staff are warm and friendly which makes it feel like an independent hotel rather than a chain .the "" can do "" attitude of all the cheerful staff is particularly apparent . </DOC> carvery had two meats and selection of veg and potatoes all of which were warm to cold and less than appetising .also items such as the apple sauce were not replenished all of which was watched over by an indifferent chef .the apple crumble and custard which whilst tasty was n't hot .also drinks are hotel pricey at ¬£ 4/pint for bitter .as we left we checked with reception re our booking which was clearly noted in the diary ! </DOC> on arrival reception staffvery friendly as was all the staff .friendly professional staff w. an excellent menu from which all dishes were well prepared and presented .very friendly and professional staff . </DOC> again excellent staff on checkout .hotel was lovely , staff were really attentive , in particular a lady on reception on saturday 13th april , who made a lovely comment about my new lime green jumper , which made my day ! ! !evening meal and breakfast were fantastic .duly arrive and advised we had a reservation to be told that we could pick any free table as "" we do n't get told about bookings "" ! appreciating that it was a value menu , we picked the fish which was cooked to order and arrivedhot and 3 carveries ."

8,"we had special dietary needs ( gluten free and diabetic ) and the staff could not have been more attentive or punctilious to make sure we had no issues or problems .the waitresses are surly and slow but there is a lovely young male water who is efficient and polite , but definitely some staff training needed .maid service was prompt and very goodservice was slow , to non existent .the front desk recommended "" jemma 's "" , which was an excellent place , but is was 90 minutes away . </DOC> lunch : mostly nice and varied , but again not a lot of choices for vegetarians and some days i had to resort to sandwiches , which the staff kindly offered to prepare for me .dinner : the menu - based dinner was usually nice , but the buffet was less exciting and again did not offer a lot of choice for vegetarians .the food was great but the service is weak for the price .i hope they improve the service over the years .the hotel was very comfortable ; the food was varied and of good quality . </DOC> our waitress was very attentive , but also very inexperienced .4.5 star .. and all it says about it is true .. the staff were wonderful ... the food very good .. cleaniness excellent .. the manager eric was very professional in his work .. talking to all his guests .. he spent a lot of hours at work from early morning till late at night every day ..there 's always room for improvement , and the management recognise this and have been very busy with the paint brushes and refurbishing the beach equipment !expensive and unreliable negative points:- - lunch buffet choice has reduced - reception staff are either under - trained or not interested in customer service will we go back ?janelle , the gr manager , gave us a lovely welcome and welcome drink and showed us to our room , offering us an upgrade to an ocean viewing room . </DOC> the friendly well trained staff .the attention to detail .the food and service were second to none .whilst i was unhappy about the prospect of having to pay extra for wifi , the free use of internet ready terminals in the reception area made up for this .the staff is excellent ; very accommodating . </DOC> we were exhausted when we returned from jemma 's , but excited to at least be able to get to our room .but i see so many that are short and negative that we feel we would like to talk in detail about our experience on this visit .before i start our guest review i should make it clear that we were ‚Äò repeaters ‚Äô to the coco reef hotel tobago having previously holidayed there in may 2003 and september 2005 on both occasions for 14 nights .it should be said that premium economy made the flight a very pleasant experience and highly recommended .the staff were all nice and do a good job but </DOC> not overly engaging .the food quality was excellent the drinkfood service was good .the hotel systems housecleaning and restaurant did not give confidence .the reception is beautiful and the setting is perfect . </DOC> generally , the staff in the hotel were helpful and provided a good service .our driver , victor , was very courteous and knowledgeable .good : + location ( plenty of restaurants nearby ) + good security + dive shop on site + high service level + restaurant is good + good beach bad </DOC> others responded basil fawlty style !we ate sandwich`s or outside of the hotel .how this hotel can be rated 4/5 star is a complete mystery .for us the crowning glory of the place was the warmth and friendliness of the staff .though there are only two restaurants , the food is plentiful and delicious ."
9,"reception staff were generally alert , helpful , friendly and reliable when passing on messages .the shower water flow was weak and often only luke - warm at peak periods .housekeeping was good on the whole but the bathroom was not always cleaned properly and provision of towels , face flannels , tissues , teabags etc was unreliable .( however a phone call to reception usually resolved any issue we had ) the man - made beach is small and sometimes crowded and the lagoon is ideal for young children or weak swimmers .there were always sufficient sun - loungers and plenty of shade beneath the palms and shelters . </DOC> we received nice fruit cocktails on arrival but then had to wait until almost 3 pm for our room .we were also told on one occasion that there was an ' emergency ' and no - one could come to escort us to the room .we eventually were told the ' emergency ' was due to the fact that someone had forgotten to put in the fold down bed and the receptionist actually giggled as she told us this .we were left to hang about in the lobby for over an hour with nothing to do and this was after a fairly rough crossing on the ferry from trinidad during which two of us were sick .check - in by friendly staff was quick and a refreshing welcome drink was offered while the dispatching with the usual formalities . </DOC> beach towels and bath towels are provided in the room , so this saves you the industry standard annoyance of having to go the proverbial beachshack to pickup beach towels everyday .breakfast and lunch were decent .elegant casual is the dress code .impressive driveway thru impressive grounds up to an equally impressive open planned reception area make it look 5 star , do n't be fooled .the reception staff appeared a touch dozy but so far so good , the rooms were excellent and we were allocated the room we requested . </DOC> the staff are so great and welcoming that i feel as if i am going to stay with friends .there are no signs on the patio doors and when i returned to our room , after having to go and get drinks , my husband had closed the doorsand i unfortunately walked into it , smashing one glass and cutting my hand .that was the start of our holiday .the bed was large and very comfortable , we had a choice of two televisions , one at the end of the bed and one in our sitting area , the air conditioning was extremely efficient and the bathroom a good size and well equipped . </DOC> whatever you had to eat or drink at whatever time of day , the service from all staff was excellent .the customer service was not all negative . </DOC> we ended up having to go to the bar ourselves to order food and drinks , which became annoying when 2 or 3 staff were talking to "" returnees"" the staff on the whole are friendly but we found one lady to be very rude .the service was dreadful .rude staff who had clearly not been trained and found guests a great inconvenience to the working day .some did not communicate at all when asked a question , they just walked away ... </DOC> but it was a shade shabby , the bed covers smelt musty as did the wardrobe , the tiles certainly needed changing in the bathroom , the staff work incredibly hard and with the exception of some of the younger , female management team were lovely but what is needed is for some serious money to be spent on the rooms to reflect the serious prices charged .the food was in my opinion excellent , particularly breakfast and dinner , my daughter has a gluten allergy and was so very well looked after with regard to this , my personal thanks to the chef and his team .i was very impressed with the service at this hotel .tamara 's restaurant - semi formal dining had to be booked each morning for that evening except buffet nights .a crib was provided free of charge ( again , call ahead to request ) . </DOC> we stayed at the coco reef hotel from 24th march for 2 weeks , and i can only say that the staff were the best i have come across in any hotel or resort for a long time !the guest services people keva and andrea were truly wonderful , and did everything to make our holiday more pleasant .watered down carib in a plastic beaker and watered down coke is never a good startbut it did set the tone and we should have left at this point .the food was barely edible - the chicken tikka and baby leaf spinach club sandwich was neither fish nor fowl but foul to taste ."

20,"i was able to get this hotel for only 180,000 yen per night ( ~$150 ) , and i still can not believe such a nice room was available at some a reasonable rate in a city like tokyo .the hotel employees were very service - oriented even considering the high standards that exist throughout japan .upon checking in , i asked reception if we can pay extra to be upgraded to club floor .she said yes so long we pay usd 120 per night for 2 pax .she said yes . </DOC> apparently though i had come to the right door , it is just laid out very strangely , with no welcoming reception lobby on arrival . despite being a marriott rewards card holder , and having spent over thirty nights in marriott hotels so far this year , i did n't receive any particular welcome ( every single other hotel has offered me refreshments on arrival after a long journey and/or arranged fruit in my room ) .guess i just did n't like the layout of the lobby plus the resterant staff were not the friendliest .the concierge lounge is on the first floor by the registration desk which a number of reviewers did nt likethe staff is responsive and flexible .staff was very helpful and took good care of is . </DOC> service was excellent and attentive , though .the breakfast buffet was really good having many helpful options .i am marriott platinum and was highly satisfied , with service , rooms and treatment .great staff ! really professional and courteous , effective !being marriott gold , we were taken into a separate check in area ( inside concierge lounge ) and received a nice upgraded room . </DOC> the sa = taff are top class and all rooms haved been renovated and are good size for a tokyo hotel .the service is top notch and very english friendly .i loved the service and the hospitality at this hotel .the in house lounge is also nice but with less vegetarian options .the breakfast buffet is outstanding . </DOC> the lobby restaurant was fast and efficient and food was decentinterestingly , my credit card company contacted me to verify my location as they feared fraudulent use and the amount was never charged .front office staff and concierge are proactive and comfortable in english .1- r√©ception : people were nice and polite and did their best to accommodate you .ultra - kind ! suepr polite ! ! </DOC> 4/5 service : 5/5workout room opens too late for any business traveler .the staff are very traditional japanese polite , attentive , professional , but with a western familiarity .our dinner was as delicious very professional staff and attention to detail was outstanding .staff is friendly and efficient and offer us wet towels ( tokyo is hot ! ! </DOC> i was met as i entered the hotel by one of the hotel staff .service / staff 5/5 restaurant 4/5as platinum members we were checked in at the exec lounge which was very efficient .w/ my luggage and was walked to the concierge lounge for a friendly check - in .everyone was very helpful and courteous . </DOC> staff are very pleasant .service at the front desk and valet is very slow ( could be cultural ) .> the breakfast again as marriott policy is excellent with great waiting staff too .in the executive lounge , the associates could not be any more helpful and friendly .staff is always very pleasant in japan ."
21,", food was amazing ! !the redeeming factor of this hotel was the breakfast buffet in the lobby each morning .the executive lounge had the same stale tacos every night , which really got old .the room was not large but super clean , bed was comfortable and internet worked flawlessly , staff was very friendly , breakfast was very good with both american and japanese varieties .but to offset that , they have a nice 25 m pool underneath and along with that , a jacuzzi and in the locker room an onsen style bath </DOC> the staff are excellent - friendly , very helpful , cheerful , and knowledgeable .the great : awesome breakfast at the hotel restaurant for gold and platinum members .the mediocre : the regular concierge seemed to be on vacation or something , so other staff filled in , their helpfulness on a 1 - 10 scale ranked from 3 to 8 .the staff are excellent , very professional , always have a nice smile and greeting .whenever we had an inquiry , the staff assisted happily and promptly . </DOC> the dinning staff were always prompt with service and did it with a smile , always willing to do that extra bit to make our stay memorable .ample choices of coffee and tea in the room , although house keeping staffs was excellentunfriendly , arrogant with zero customer focus or customer appreciation .although i mentioned i needed a quiet room as i ' m a light sleeper and that i needed good internet as i had multiple calls scheduled throughout the week , the lady assigned me with a room with a very poor internet and facing the train tracks all topped with windows which were n't properly closing .after mentioning this the next morning they did n't bother giving me another room but wanted to fix the windows . </DOC> i even believed they did until later that week when the howling noise of the wind was back aneven calls organized from the executive lounge were constantly interrupted because of the bad connection .management does n't care about customers or guests well being .only exception was the restaurant staff .everybody was nice and truly cared about us . </DOC> the lounge also has tea service and substantial snacks in the early evening .my experience here has always been very nice .the staff is great as they always have been .it is complimentary and runs rather frequently during the week and less in the weekend .check - in : was fast and efficient as expected by japanese standard . </DOC> friendly the one major issue was the vegetarian options - very limited ( actually one dish ) in the restaurant or room service menu - and was surprised they were not flexible to make or provide other options but overall the hotel rooms were clean , comfortable , spacious andstaying here currently and decided to go to the gym and pool .pool is paid and i was asked to go to the reception and enrol to marriott membership if i wanted to use gym without paying .do you expect guests to carry their membership card all the time ?and if so , plz be kind enough in mentioning it at the time of booking so that we can go to other properties and not stay with you . </DOC> have never stayed in any of your properties ( or other hotels ) across the world so far where a guest is asked to pay for gaining access to swimming pool or gym .if your policies are so strict , you should mention clearly on your website that the hotel does n't have pool or gym unless you pay extra ... that way at least you are not misleading all the guests who expect these basic services which all your other properties or competitive hotels seem to provide ....marriott branding means a good staff and good food .the buffet breakfast in the lobby lounge restaurant is excellent with large selection of made to order eggs , oatmeal , fruits , etc ...i found the staff very friendly and helpful . </DOC> the front desk was n‚Äôt very helpful but the lounge was good - except that the food is the same each night .breakfast was very good .staff members were very kind and helpful .and she was professional and kind .shuttle service to shingawa was helpful for the trip ."

29,"check in was smooth & efficient .however we did notice on both mornings that despite the breakfast room being fairly quiet , staff were slow to top up items when they had run out .e.g , eggs , fruit juice , pastries , all of which i had to ask to be replenished .the food was fine & well presented & overallstaff were friendly though academy was not always manned . had projector issues but staff resolved them quickly . </DOC> i was upgraded to a ' executive room ' as i ' m a spire elite member .on a positive note the staff were all friendly .but i was upgraded to a king bedded room , i was also given welcome amenity points .we had not stayed at this hotel for a couple of years and received a very friendly welcome on our return .breakfast was as we remembered it : plenty of choice and friendly and helpful waiting staff , two of whom we remembered from our previous stay . </DOC> this , he said , was excellent and all freshly cooked .the housekeeping staff were friendly and smiling , greeting us each day with a ' good morning ' .staff okay except lady on reception who was always on her phone ( just does not look professional )this is a comfortable hotel , with great service and friendly accommodating staff .when i requested the bbq sauce i was provided with a bottle of hp ! ! </DOC> house - keeping / maintenance certainly let down their general manager and guests , by not making the room unavailable due to the broken window frame ; as for not having a telephone in the room , i ‚Äôthe lady at the reception was friendly and check - in did not take too long .friendly welcome but despite platinum card no upgrade was offered-the breakfast was very good , i ordered freshly made omelette which was greatrooms are just ok and also would class them as average , ¬£ 10 for 24hr wifi was also grudgingly aid , wake up when you are an average hotel , paying for extra 's such as wifi and parking do n't encourage people to return . </DOC> this holiday inn meets all expectations , in welcome , rooms and services .6 , good breakfast with plenty of options 7 , ok if small gym area which is accessed by your room card 8 , the staff in the main are friendly and helpful , especially the night manager when i asked to change rooms in the morning .and it was delivered promptly and courteously .when we arrived roza and her team were warm and welcoming .they had had an incident that morning resulting in staff members requiring hospital treatment , however they remained positive and professional . </DOC> very friendly staff and a great welcome on arrival .i find that holiday inns can be a little ' samey ' however the staff here do make this a really pleasant stay .the room was standard fare for a holiday inn , just what you 'd expect , however the breakfast and staff were good .every time we have experienced a friendly and efficient check - in and out service , and a "" nothing is too much trouble "" attitude in the restaurant / breakfast room .the reception staff are always helpful and efficient . </DOC> the receptionist offered a free drink in the bar but we opted to leave hotel and manager to ring me , not had a phone call yet after 14 days doubt i will .overall could be good when the current manager is replaced as the staff need someone with customer service skills to manage them .and i received good servicecheerful reception & bar staff , i will stay here again , but choose to eat elsewhere .its just disappointing that you stay in a hotel for 3 days and they ca n't find just one evening to upgrade you . </DOC> the staff in the restaurant are very friendly and professional and the one evening meal i did have in the hotel was well presented and served quickly and efficiently .from the moment you walk into the hotel you are greeted by happy smiling staff , and that is an experience that continues whoever you deal with , be it the bar staff , the maintenance man or room service .we had a meal in the restaurant one evening , and whilst the food was very good , the service was very slow .this was due a function in another part of the hotel taking precedence over the restaurant .breakfast was a mixed bag : the first morning was excellent , the remaining two , there were several issues such as breakfast items not being replenished , severe lack of orange juice , hot food too long on the hot plate and becoming dried and unpleasant ."

38,"the staff were very friendly and helpful .all 3 courses were lovely and the staff friendly and helpful with good service .the staff are really nice and friendly .my wife asked for some more and the reception staff provided bath gel and shampoo this time .both mornings i failed to get an egg for breakfast even though i asked the chef and the scrambled egg was more like mortar . </DOC> no attempt was made to explain / upsell / build any rapport to tempt us back again .no security at all anyone can walk in through one of fire doors which were left open 24/7 ! seeing all the fag ends on the ground outside these doors does n't give a good impression .and there was no soundproofing whatsoever .however the food they served was amazing , had dinner there and breakfast the next morning .it was the quality of a top hotel , such a shame about the rest . </DOC> we had to wait for the repair man , who did n't really look like a proper maintenance guy .he went away , came back and then had to admit defeat .check in was quick and efficient .reception was unmanned but we were shown through to the restaurant / conservatory which was empty and given seats between the two - so we moved rather than be in a thoroughfare .the tea was brought promptly and the service was good in terms of checking whether we wanted more tea / coffee throughout the afternoon and describing the sandwiches to us . </DOC> non of the cakes or scones were homemade .all seemed to be supermarket cheap brands .we were welcomed by a very friendly waiter and seated immediatelysurely offering these teas is meant to encourage return custom , it 's not working .the first room we were given had it 's curtain rail hanging off the wall , so it was back to reception to ask to be moved to another room . </DOC> the reception staff were all smiling , room adequate and clean but bathroom needs upgrading , the shower needed some effort to turn off .based upon my previous experience did not have an evening meal but the breakfast was good .the evening meal was average , although reasonably priced .the breakfast was very nice .all the food was served on a flat plate , </DOC> , i asked for some parmesan cheese but never saw the waitress again .i was n't asked if i wanted any wine , was the mealokay etc , etc .the meal itself was tasteless and bland but the garlic bread was okay ! !the strange thing is the breakfast was excellent ! </DOC> what was suppose to be a evening of celebration became disastrous . </DOC> this stay found me a tad under the weatherso i did n't go out for dinner with my colleagues and chose to eat in the hotel . ordering pasta , chicken and garlic breadi was told the kitchen was busy( the restaurant was by no means full ) and there 'd be a short wait .fifty minutes later and after a query about the length of time the meal arrived ! !"
39,"it was clear that we had been forgotten .i eventually managed to get the attention of our waiter and he brought the food out shortly following this .other reviews on here have made comments about dry and stale sandwiches .the sandwiches were fresh and we had a selection of egg mayonnaise , tuna mayonnaise , ham and cheese .we were both more than happy with this selection . </DOC> the staff were friendly and i felt sorry for them trying to do their best in poor surroundings .food in the restaurant was average .the staff were very friendly .however , although we were served our drinks quite promptly , we had quite a wait for our food .several other parties came in after us and were brought their food before us . </DOC> the interior was not much better , the reception area was shabby and there bar furniture worn and damaged .this was vwery pleasant although the coffee was stewed .no shops etc and the mobile phone signal ( vodaphone at least ) is very very poorstaff always very good and and very approachable .so could not use the mirror . </DOC> the bathroom was a again a shade dated but everthing worked ok including plenty of hot water the staff that we met were freindly and check in was smooth the food was very good actuallyand the buffet breakfast was great , all the trays were kept topped up with fresh fried eggs mushrooms tomatoes etc .friends room key never worked during stay , had to get staff to let them in every time .no meal available in restaurant as there was a funeral reception on . ran out of bacon at breakfast .just a fiasco really . </DOC> the staff were friendly and they have a large car park .this time for the 3 course festive lunch with a groupon voucher table was dressed with crackers etc meal was very tasty followed by tea or coffee and all for under ¬£ 7 the service was good as always even though there was a funeral wake going on and the staff were rushed of their feet with thatthen a lovely cheesecake for sweet .it 's safe to say that nothing has been done to improve the hotel in the 3 1/2 years since our previous stay .for goodness sake send staff out with a bin bag to clear up ! </DOC> added to that there was lots of previous guests hair all around the room . </DOC> the young man on reception was efficient and gave us directions to our room 222 .the night porter was excellent and very helpful , well worth a stay if you are in the area . </DOC> the cakes did n't appear to be home made , but they were all very tasty-not a bad hotel , in need of a revamp , service is very lax , really nice staff butthe lack of stock in both food and drink gives the staff no heart in the job .unless you get a really good rate and are on a strict budgetthe waiter went into the kitchen , came back and said "" there was none left so i had extra tartare sauce instead ."
40,"the food was well cooked and substantial , but as is often the case mid - week in these type of hotels very quiet with only 4 tables taken at 8 pm .service was good and staff pleasant .no real ale available on handpumps , but a fair choice of other drinks available .the entertainment was excellent , the food was good but not great .ok but no fresh fruit , staff in breakfast room </DOC> it was put down with fingers and the thumb on the spout of the jug - basic hygiene issues .so did n't get a great sleep .all staff were friendly , helpful and approachable .reception was a good experience ...tv reception was indifferent . </DOC> can not praise the staff enoughthey was all polite friendly and attentive .saying that we had a fantastic time in this lovely well run hotel staff are faultless nothing to much problem always happy and friendly .oscars restaurant delightfully .lovely food great staff and service .we were greeted with a lovely smile from quick and lovely staff at check in . </DOC> the staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful .breakfast is disorganised it just lacks management .someone to tell some of the younger staff , who look as if they ' ve just rolled out of bed in the clothes that they are wearing , to smarten up .food kept running out , but was nicely cooked , it just needed someone to lead and manage the sitting .food in the oscars resturant was well served and attentive and delicious wonderful staff . </DOC> we found a note in our room later about manually operating the tv from the top buttons .6 ft plus husband had to stand on a chair to try and reach them .we were n't impressed with our dinner , which had been pre ordered .the staff are excellent , and we were upgraded without asking , a lovely gesture .we ate in oscars restaurant , , where the food and staff were both great . </DOC> and we could only get weird sound and colour on the tv .mentioned all this to the receptionist on our way to dinnerand she said she would sort the towels ( in the end , we got one extra bath towel only ! )implied the telly was ok and that we were the problem and told us the manager had gone homeand she could n't sort the towel rail . </DOC> the hotel receptionist was very friendly and helpful .good vegetarian options and helpful friendly waiting staff .reception was quick and in my room in no time.lots of space ( room 40 )the food at the wedding reception was good and breakfast in the restaurant was quite good .the staff were always friendly and amenable . </DOC> down , very warm indeed .we had to have the window open all night , and my husband was awake all night with a dreadful cough brought on by the humid air quality .over the next few days he had a high fever and an infection on his chest .drinks were very over priced .the customer service was appalling too , when we complained at check out the receptionist did not even apologise , and the manager was not available ."
41,"every staff member i dealt with was helpful and cheerful ... despite seeing one young man at almost all evening meals & breakfast , he still had a ready smile !breakfast alternated between buffet & table service , i do n't have a preference for either and the food was always top notch .it is a really nice staff and comfortthe food is very good and very good choice .it was a warm day , and not one that might require central heating in the rooms . </DOC> the staff were both welcoming and helpful and our room was spacious .the breakfast in the morning was buffet style and very good , the staff were helpfull and polite .the required accessories are there .breakfast was good - plenty on offer .for meals we walked through the hotel to oscars restaurant , we were greated by lynne and tom and the rest of the staff was very pleasant and helpful , the food was very good . </DOC> oh dear ‚Ä¶ .. my first comment is , that the staff at this hotel are excellent .without exception , they were friendly , courteous and professional .there were tea and coffee facilities in the room .the kettle had stale water in it presumably from the last occupants .my first impressions were encouraging . </DOC> i am afraid we were rather disappointed , the room was very basic and lacked character and the restaurant was very strange , not sure how to describe it , looked a bit like an after thought tacked on to the hotel .the food was o.k .for dinner and breakfastbut nothing stood out .staff friendly and helpful . </DOC> our booking in process was good and reception staff friendly .very pleasant waiting staff though .the staff were most efficient and pleasant at both dinner and breakfast .the staff are good , but i had a pint in the golden lion also in the villagewe had stayed at this hotel many years ago and had been very impressed and were looking forward to our return visit . </DOC> would recommend the hotel as long as they improve the breakfast service .the staff clearly could not cope .the staff were slow to clear tablesthe food soon ran out and the staff were slow to replenish .its a shame because with more organised staff it would be an excellent place to stay . </DOC> evening meal good but service slow .other staff also pleasant .but it is never hot , plates and food very slow to be replaced .nice dining room for breakfast with friendly staffdespite the weather , i was warm enough , which was very good . </DOC> / bar all goodbut guy on reception really did not try to sell the dining roomthe cleaners left a big bag of rubbish in our room which we put outside .the breakfast on the sunday morning was a joke .toast came cold and a long time after it was ordered ."
42,"but i have to say the drivers were very carefulthe breakfast was lovely , never really had an issue waiting too long .the pizzas were lovely but at peak times there was quite a queue .we enjoyed every evening meal .i am quite a fussy eater and always found something to eat . </DOC> i also have quite a sensitive stomach and am usually prone to a dicky tummy at some point on holiday , but not here so that was pleasing ! ! ! !if you love queues then this is the place for you up to two hours to check in go to the bar queue for drinksgo to the restaurant queue to get in then queue for food when in the staff that are theredo there bestbut they need at least 50 % more staff upgrade drinks 10 euro </DOC> quality was not always the best .the wine was ok , drinks from the bar were good , cocktails very refreshing , enjoyed my irish coffee while watching the entertainment , again good .most important : the hotel is very quiet ,the buffet restaurant is ok , but not better than about average for this type of hotel .the staff are friendly and hard working - and they need to be . </DOC> fantastic food with some very talented chefs and a great wide selection of options at each setting .anyone who complains about the food here must be an extremely fussy eater .the check in was fairly quick , as the reception has a dedicated family / children desk .the drinks are fine , self service in some areas .the staff are generally very friendly , but could work a little faster . </DOC> i love motown but the motown duo were absolutely terrible ... one could n't dance or sing and they both forgot the words to the songs !one think that did annoy usthe views are stunning , 12 swimming pools , the buffet is great , themed nights ( canarian , spanish , italian cooking ) .the staff is really up to the mark , friendly , efficient .unfortunately we had a lot of cloud , rain and high winds and the occasional few hours of sun , but when the sun came out it was really hot . </DOC> also , orange juice , sandwiches , cakes and bananas were provided for those waiting so that was impressive .the whole restaurant was in use ( first time i have seen that ) and it was mad busy - not enjoyable .the food was n't quite as good as usualdrinks on the silver bands are good , no need to pay for premium .entertainment was hopeless ... avoid ! </DOC> about 9 ish to be met by a male receptionist who had could n't care less attitude .not like us holiday makers keep him in a job .but that 's our opinion only , the entertainment staff seem to be on all day .i would divide the experience into two parts : the infrastructure and the services .the staff were all very helpful and polite and our cleaner did a great job . </DOC> the queue diminished quickly due to the efficiency of the reception staff .whenever there was any debris in the pool , the pool staff were quickly onto it and cleaned it without delay .the restaurant staff were quick to clear tables and to bring equipment that was in short supply .the entertainment staff were first class , always up and about informing guests of activities .food was very good ."
43,"all inclusive finishes at 12 pm on leaving day .you ca n't take food from the restaurant .all inclusive goes on till you leave .just ask if you want to take food from the restaurant .no shortage of sunbeds . all inclusive:- excellent - real glasses on the terrace , plastic by the pools . </DOC> and we were on uor way by 08:30 am !most staff were professional and polite , with a few exceptions as everywhere .we mentioned this to reception but nothing was done .there appears to be a lot of rules and regulationsi.e. you have to pay for pool towels . </DOC> the two set meals , with waitress service , on christmas eve and christmas day were good , but we found the rest of the food disappointing .the staff were helpful and friendly and the staff at the main bar work really hard to serve everyone quickly .there is even lime cordialarrived at 09:30 pm , just before the dinning room closed , but still managed to enjoy the buffet .good breakfast buffet </DOC> most of the bar staff were excellent with one exception .the management should send in the mystery shopper and weed that young lady out !dining was very well organisedvery few staff are fully competent in english , which for cosmopolitan guests is rather limiting ..we would agree with previous reviewers that the grounds are superb - very extensive , beautifully planted and well looked after . </DOC> staff are friendly enough apart from one in the bar by reception , he gave the impression he did n't want to serve you , i wo n't mention any names as other people will have noticed this too ..food was repetitive and not always hot , the bacon or whatever it was supposed to be was burnt everyday in fact it was black ..the journey was skillfully navigated by the coach driver , in fact , we found all drivers efficient and safe .the food was lovely with some outstanding dishes and it was easy to self serve the wine and beer which meant no waiting to catch the eye of the waiter / waitress .raquel answered my email , saying she would do what she could . </DOC> first impressions were good , friendly service and check in was quick .the complex has 10 pools and to have 3 heated would be better .the management knew how many guests they had but did n‚Äôt plan well .some choices were n‚Äôt appealing .the hotel staff gave very good service in the dining room and at the hotel bar . </DOC> one of the reception staff said it would be best if at least half the people went to get dinner now otherwise by the time they were checked in the restaurant would be closed .my husband and i have just returned from this lovely hotel .the food is excellent , some days they even have proper steaks!!.all the staff including the thomson reps , the entertainment team , reception , waiters porters , kitchen staff etc . were very nice .receptionists are helpful and efficient when they are there . </DOC> food in the restaurants always very good with more than enough choice even for the fussy eater .staff friendly and professional .the facilities are very good .the ' animacion ' team are goodhowever , the receptionists were very efficient and the wait did not seem too long ."
44,"all the staff are friendly , even the guy on the pool bar who could do with some help instead of being on his own most of the day on the only pool bar that was open when we were there ( which worked in our favour as it made the far pools nice and quiet ) .the food in the outside bar / food areas was ok but in the main dining room , the food was very disappointing .i have to say the staff in general were very dour and quite miserable .that said if the price was right & the forecast good , we probably would return .tui - shocking customer service . </DOC> queues for the coffee machines ‚Ä¢ queues for the freshly cooked main mealsthis is poor .plenty of sun loungers , staff also helpful .the staff were professional and helpful even while under stress at busy times . </DOC> must say the pizzas were delicious and we do n't usually like them .we found the staff to be very helpful , friendly and attentive ( as per reviews that we 'd seen before we travelled ) .much of what needs to be said about this hotel has already been said , queues from check in to check out are the order of the day .saying that our shower door did get stuck and when reported it one evening when we returned it was fixed .food - we were disappointed that there was only a choice of the buffet in the evening . </DOC> each per day extrathen your still arguing what bottles of beer you can get place is no good in january far to windy lovely big hotel with loads of possibilities but far from it just now first and last time for meground immaculately maintained and staff helpful .the deal was very good and was excellent value for money .we found the reception staff to be friendly and helpful at all times . </DOC> jay who was the thomsons rep was very helpful and always approachable .the food on offer was enjoyable as there was always something for everyone .bar drinks were ok although sometimes long delays in service at the bar created annoyance .staff nice and helpful .totally self service . </DOC> now accept that this is an all inclusive , but service of wine and drinks at table in an establishment marketed as a thomson platinum hotel should be a given as opposed to serving yourself to wine from a machine - this is 3 star service .the food was good and varied .* the main restaurant was not 4 star .there is no ambience , out of 7 nights , we sat at tables with stained table cloths ( even though we were the first to sit there at those sessions ) .they cater for such a large number of people that there are queues everywhere . </DOC> staff : excellent and friendly throughout .whilst both the hotel website and the tour operators brochures highlight these charges it does n‚Äôt make them any more palatable .many reviews mention thisthis is the fourteenth hotel we have stayed at during 2015 and the first to have made a charge for such facilities .given there is only one entrance to the buffet restaurant it would n‚Äôt seem too onerous for the restaurant manager to politely request that all guests comply thus enhancing the enjoyment of the majority ! </DOC> there is plenty going on , the entertainment staff are enthusiastic and most of the evening cabaret were either first class or very good .we tried the special restaurant but this was a huge disappointment , we were refunded the extra charge , although others enjoyed theirs .staff here work very hard , some better than others .you always needed serviettes to pick them up .always cloth napkins at the table , a nice touch ."
45,"the thomson rep and the hotel staff were excellent .cases were taken to the room by the staff .they are good in size , you have to pay to change them its pennies buteach is not cheap , but the food looked varied when we had a nose around .firstly if you go to la palma flying with thomson airways be prepared for their nonsensical 5 kg hand luggage rule , that 's 5 kg each and not one piece between two persons weighing 10 kg . </DOC> no flexibility , no nothing in the thomson airways queue just rigid rules ~ think ryanair .for the first two days the weather was lovely .then the winds arrived with a vengeance .the weather was atrocious all day and the tour lasted ten and a half hours !eg - charging for internet access and then only available in the reception area ; </DOC> i must give credit to the animation team who do work relentlessly with no dip in enthusiasm .always welcomed with a smile .the animation team were excellent . </DOC> i booked four nights here and generally was happy here .but i managed each night to eat at on the terrace which was very pleasant .the food on offer was good to very good butgood staff throughout , butfood is plentiful with all diets catered for and i found no difficulty being a pescatarian as everything is labelled . </DOC> overall it has been one of the better hotels targeting the mass all - inclusive market with just the food available at meal and other times being not as good as i have experienced elsewhere .was fast and the buffet was great .the weather was warm , but was cloudy part of each day for most of the week .the food and drink was excellent .why does thomson have to dress it up with its own t rating system ? </DOC> charging to change pool towels more than once a week etc etc* similarly , the coffee served up on the all inclusive packagethe food was plentiful and varied and there were theme nights including mexican , canarian , spanish , italian and asian .if you get over this , what you get is a very good 4 star hotel at a good price , especially on an all inclusive deal .most staff friendly , had minor problem with one barman who ignored women to serve men first . </DOC> now that 's what i call excellent sevice .a bit more service from the staff in the restaurant would be nice , the few staff who were there tended to clear and set tables , nobody was serving , everybody had to queue for drinks , would n't take much to have a few staff serving wine or coffee .if that is not your thing , why go ? !the staff were a mixture of friendly and not so friendly ( with the majority in the former ) , my wife speaks spanish fluently and likes nothing better than talking to the staff / locals , some were more cooperative than others shall we say .we were not at all impressed with the check in procedure , it was like a cattle market with 4,5 or maybe it was 6 coaches all arriving at once </DOC> overall it is a lovely hotel in a lovely spot if you are happy to relax and chill without feeling the need to wander .we were happy with the choice and quality of food and used both restaurants in the evenings and la choza or the pizzeria at lunchtime , if we were in the hotel during the day .in fairness we found most of the comments from previous reviewers to be accurate .this only applies at the end of your stay if you fail to return them ‚Äìotherwise no money changes hands"
46,"the staff were all friendly and lovely , in fact everyone on the island is so .the management were at the door to greet usand i would like to think that life will be good enough to us in order there will be more visits to follow .four years ago we found spice island beach resort as brian hardy the general manager kindly helped accommodate us after we needed to leave la source which went into administration whilst we were staying there on two weeks holiday .that said the aircon was efficient enough to cope with 30c temperatures if a little noisy . </DOC> the food was very good indeed with some standout courses - the veal chops , the lobster , lots of wonderful local fish and some very delicious puddings .unfortunately the quality of the wine does not match the excellent quality of the food which is disappointing .the staff are the most professional , friendly and helpful i have encountered .staff were excellent , food was to die for ( especially the herb risotto ) .and they all have the same problems . </DOC> the welcome was warm and friendly .we had a fantastic week here ( during which i celebrated a big birthday ) and it was fantastic .the staff are helpful , attentive and friendly but also recognise that some guests are happy being quiet .very friendly service quick and efficient housekeeping mini fridge stocked with your requests very nice gym with top of the line equipment , tvs and air conditioning clean beach , no real seaweed loved the different types of mustards each evening with the bread basket and homemade ice cream .no nasty buffets , no surly attitudes every meal was like something from a top london restaurant . </DOC> the garden staff work incredibly hard scrubbing the paths and patios every dayas other people have said , the personal touch is present from the moment you arrive and are greeted by the manager .from that moment until leaving we were treated to some of the best and most friendly service we have ever had . </DOC> there have been some negative comments posted on tripadviser by guests who are clearly misguided in what they require from a vacation who may have been better suited to a beach rave in resorts such as benidorm or ibiza !however , the food on the menu in the evenings was not always to our taste , it may be the fact we are getting older and do not appreciate the onion & pepper dressings that appear on the majority of the main courses which alters the fresh flavours of fish and some other dishes .overall another wonderful stay with sir royston 's team doing their upmost to ensure a memorial stay .we were met by a number of staff on arrival who all made us feel very welcomethe service was charming and exemplary at all levels . </DOC> fine but other dishes such as pancakes were dry .we have just returned from 12 nights at spice island being our first time in the caribbean and can not recommend it highly enough , from the moment we entered the hotel until the moment we left we were made to feel very special , the staff are exceptionalthe food is exceptional very varied menu , delicious choices how anyone manages afternoon tea is beyond us .people were very friendly .many of the staff recognized us from previous visits and greeted us with ' welcome home ! ' . </DOC> let me address the food here .everything meal is approached in a very formal manner from breakfast right through to dinner .breakfast is a quite disappointing affair with a very limited selection of pastries and fruit and the cooked choices not always cooked to perfection .the mini bar was also well stocked on a daily basis and the barman was happy to bring your preferences .the chef was most accommodating also . </DOC> the ground staff are all friendly and polite and they do an amazing job of keeping the whole place spotless .but overall , the staff is very friendly and accomodating , welcoming you with big smiles and good mood .staff and management were so friendly and helpful . would definately go back .everything ticks over like clock work and the staff are well trained , highly accommodating and thoughtful .staff are quick to replenish glasses and to offer a picnic if you are heading out ."
47,"all aspects of service excellent , on every occasion the well trained staff without exception always call you by your name and every meal timenot stuffy at all but great service ,lovely staff and it really is uncanny how everyone knows your name .the bar service , food and staff are all excellent .polite but not stuffy and </DOC> the staff are attentive to your every need and generally chatty .the staff were very accommodating to our needs including my 2 year old nephew eating at strange times of day outside of the main lunch and dinner periods .if you are grumpy about happily playing children in the pool , then either go to elsewhere or book a room with a private pool .the children 's menu is absolutely delicious , and they will happily provide meals outside of the normal restaurant hours .sir royston and all his staff should be congratulated . </DOC> the staff all knew our names and always provided great service .the spa was the only part of the hotel , which was n't up to the same standard as the rest of the hotel , but a problem i encountered was soon rectified , even though i had n't said anything , and i was really impressed by the customer service attitude .the service really is excellent from every member of staff .the staff was very pleasant , and many of them went out of their way to make the guests feel comfortable .the staff are so welcoming from when you arrive - you are personally greeted by a member of the management team ( in our case tamara ) . </DOC> the service and hospitality from all the staff was the best we have ever encountered , nothing was too much trouble and within a few days after arrival , they all addressed by name every time .and i notice other people mention , the service at all mealtimes is extremely slow and it does n't seem to make any differenceall was well until i tried to turn on the water in one of the sinksand none came out of the tap !we reported this and the management who were full of apologies and we were immediately ungraded to a royal suite . </DOC> the best part however was the staff , they were so welcoming and friendly , that they made our stay wonderful .we arrived quite late in the evening from barbados and were greeted in a friendly and efficient manner and advised we had been given a complimentary upgrade .service was exceptional , staff address you by name after a few days , and always ask your name not your room number .everyone was friendly and helpful , the dinners were marvellous - i had the finest steak i have ever tasted one night , and for my wife 's birthday we were given lobster and a generous sized birthday cake that we shared with two other couples we met .the staff are amazing and standards are very high in general </DOC> the friendly staff could not have been more helpful , happily serving drinks to us on the beach away from the bar .the service was very good indeed .normally these factors would make me very happybreakfast service was very slow even though it ran fromthe two factors that really stood out to me were the amazing service and the equally amazing food ( 7 course dinners to die for ! ) . </DOC> all of the staff are great , too many to mention .for ours and the staff 's safety everything closed early , but it was well managed and luckily the storm passed with no damagefrom the meet & greet thru ' to departing the hotel the food , service , accomodation and staff were all first class and , in our opinion , faultless .the service is out of this world good !the drinks were all very good and great quality ! </DOC> the food was always first class .everyone of the staff were so friendly and professional , most greeted us by name .the staff is most attentive and knows your name by the next day .2nd stay at this hotel - staff most welcoming & helpful .the staff are worth of special mention as they offer first rate service without being overly attentive as is often the case where you feel tips are everything ."
48,"a small bit of discretion would n't have gone amiss .also , trying to pay for a drink at the bar with cash appears to throw everyone into a panic , involving hand - written invoices , trips to reception with the cash and generally a ten minute wait to get some change .the staff were always happy to help with our needs .all the staff were kind and attentive allowing us to have the wedding speeches when we wished and holding up the meal for them .all the waiting staff were very pleasant and eager to please . </DOC> bar service was excellent , with premium brands supplied , and also available were a variety of interesting fruity drinks without alcohol .. beach , sea , gardens , public areas and pool were pristine and perfect .the staff can not do enough for you .we were , however , surprised at how soulless the bar area appearedto be - staff were n't particularly friendly and it had the atmopshere of a retirement home .certainly when my wife sparked up a cigarette while enjoying a drink by the pool , unaware that there is no smoking allowed anywhere on the resort , we did n't expect a barman to come rushing over and shouting loudly for her to put it out . </DOC> the accommodation , the staff and food are as good as ever . </DOC> as with most hotel locations we have visited in the caribbean , service quality can be patchy and whether it 's shyness or not , some of the staff appear to not be terribly welcoming or friendly .on arrival the check in was swift & efficient and the cold towels and cocktail very much appreciated .the staff at spice island are truly memorable , friendly and courteous and the service excellent in every way .the staff are wonderful and know you by name after just a few hours .we knew the moment we walked in , when the staff staff already knew our names , that this place was special . </DOC> it was the best way to explore the island at our own pace and the process of hiring was smooth and effortless .all the staff were first class , always smiling and addressing you by your name .they were all faultless in making our stay excellent .the management staff in particular and excellent .the food was plentiful , tasty and well seved . </DOC> staff were very good throughout the hotel .bar was good with a fine selection of branded and local drinks .the food was outstanding and all the staff were most welcoming , friendly and efficient .sir royston , his family and staff do an excellent job and create a comfotable atmosphere .all of the staff are so helpful and always friendly with a lovely smile . </DOC> we arrived and were greeted my staff and management .the spa has great services , and the massages were top notch !considering we were there over the holidays and new years ( full occupancy ) , the service was 5 stars .from the moment we arrived it is like coming home , everyone is so attentive and welcoming and it is in such a beautiful setting on grande anne beach .this year we found the service here exceptional in all aspects of the resort . </DOC> the staff are extremely attentive and very keen to please .guests are known by their name not a number and the staff are very friendly and always have a smile .there is a varied menu and the food and service is excellent .we arrived late afternoon and were welcomed by some lovely staff at reception , given an ice - cold towel and a delicious cocktail .met by the management team on arrival which was a nice touch and similarily on departure ."
49,"service level also satisfactory .the breakfast is average for a 5 star hotel and the food in the restaurant is generally good , but nothing special .the service is great and extremely friendly .this includes all staff from the reception staff to the gardener .the check - in procedure was very friendly and relaxed , but took far too long . </DOC> the staff really is outstanding -- just keep in mind that not every employee speaks perfect english --- if you have a service issue , communicate it to a manger to be certain it has been understood .the breakfast buffet really sucked , nothing good to say there at all .when we arrived again the next day , while the welcome was hugely warm and generous , we found our original choice of hotel room -service poolside is friendly and the bar menu is wide - ranging .the staff is extremely responsive and helpful . </DOC> staff is great , and the beach is spectacular .staffs are very nice indeed .service from staff is also nice and friendly .staff and service was fabulous and always professional .the beach is pretty nice and its always on low tie in the evening </DOC> , we got such a warm welcome since we arrived .she is really friendly and attentive , she walked us the room afterward and also explain everything about the hotel .it would be nice if they could do something with it .very well trained polite staff , from front office over kitchen to housekeeping .the service was sometimes excellent and other times not . </DOC> staff are very friendly although at busy times they seem a bit overstretchedstaff have been nice and helpful for our whole stay . </DOC> the person helping with the checkin did not inform us of whether wifi and breakfast was included in the package till i prompted him . for an hour lights in the room kept switching on and off till they got us a replacement key card .the front desk number was busy for a long while .the pool area though beautiful , did not have covers off the loungers till we asked and the towels were not provided immediately .the buffet did not serve fresh orange juice and we had to pay for it separately .mind you , this is day 1 ! </DOC> the staff was excellent and the spa personnel provided outstanding treatments during our stay .it has a fridge and daily free tea and coffee making facilities .the staff are friendly and efficient just when booking make sure there are no functions as the hotel can not cope during this period and there are just to many people .our vacation was spoilt by this start , but overall the service , food and ambiance was excellent .additionally , the bathroom is exposed to the outside so you have to be aware of mosquitos and other bugs at night . </DOC> after about 20 mins , someone came to the desk and my treatment started 35 mins late ."
50,"/early evening just as we returned from the pool and wanted to get ready to go out .the two for one cocktail details at two points in the hotel were never accurately shown , it was a real hit and miss , and we heard others also complaining that the notices were out of date .pool area was nice , good sunbedsi have already sent in my compliments to the gm via email last month but thought i would post the same email here as we were very happy with our stay .we were very happy and very pleased with our stay with my wife and baby . </DOC> so friendly and always smiling .service is really good though .the staff do try their best and are genuinely friendly and great with babies .check - in and check - out : check - in was pretty slow .but if you are an existing or new spg member , you might want to check that they provide the discounts on food / spa that you are entitled to as they forgot to do this for us . </DOC> the staff are among the friendliest and most attentive we ' ve found anywhere in the world , and as much as we enjoyed the villa , it 's the incredible staff we 'll remember most .hope this review is helpful to everyone including the hotel it selfwe were welcomed by cold towels and a nice welcome drink .he was very kind and polite .and i agree with previous reviewers that tina liu , the gm , showed exceptional presence and oversight . </DOC> we started to write the names of the good staff to send appreciationsstaff were genuinely warm , very friendly and attentive as well as the hotel is well maintained .the staff were very good with our babystaff are willing to offer help but they seldom show their smiling faces in the resort unless needed .anyway , i believe it is the problem of the quality of samui people ' services . </DOC> the thai food is very bland , and i suspect "" europeanized "" .would definitely recommend the hotel , as the rooms are fantastic ( try and get the pool villas , they are great ) , the staff are friendly , and food great .v - they are darkstaff at hotel were very helpful and friendlybut if you ring the telephone urgent call line when something like the latern ceremony is on you get no response as everyone is busy and </DOC> great to go out and chill on during the day and have a few drinks in the eveningthe staff were all very friendly , the rooms comfortable and nice , and the facilities very good , but having just come from the intercon , i was a little underwhelmed .few healthy options .the staff world class and very affordable .for the set dinner , it was a proper and delicious 3 course meal , either thai or western style . </DOC> .. immediately a friendly face approaches us and leads us to a comfortable seating arrangement .the welcome drinks arrive and i inquire about the missed transfer .she looks surprised and rushes to the front desk , the staff of whom seems to have overheard our exchange and spoken to their driver already .they are profusely apologetic , offer to upgrade all the three rooms we had booked and throw in a complimentary return hotel airport transfer as well .my wife injured herself on a snorkeling trip during our stay , when we returned to the resort the assistance staff gave us was exceptional . </DOC> you know those hotel surveys that ask insipid questions like : "" were you enchanted by your stay "" , or "" did the staff make you feel appreciated "" ?the good : -the staff , from tina liu the manager right on down to the porters , are excellent , friendly , professional , and extremely well trained -the complex is very well designed and beautiful -the hotel treats platinum members very well ( above and beyond the toc )the service is good and very friendly .but when they see you want to interact , they are warm and accommodating of almost any request .while english was an issue , the staff 's warmth and desire to help overrode the problem ."
51,"there was no visible supervisory staff available at any time .needs sorting out , the food was okthis is not the fault of the staff who work very hard and very long hoursthey just more staff to cope with the number of people .this was the same at all of the bars , the staff worked hard but they were doubling up on the bar after working in the restaurant , often only 1 member of staff meant having to wait longer than you would like . </DOC> the animation guy was great again worked hardthis is listed as a 4 star hotel , no way , 3 star for decor etc , but they need to employ more staff .breakfast was top class ,lunch good , evening meal seemed to lack something ,staff - really could not fault them , very friendly at reception and very attentive in the bars and restaurants , again i see some people complaining about staff but they were fine and keen to help . </DOC> i will add that the senior lady on reception was very helpful and we hired a car through the hotel, we were happy with the room it had 2 bedrooms with comfortable beds apart from the pillows made of foam .the front desk staff were very helpful and friendly , however , and the restaurant was even opened for us at 3:30 am so we could pick some coffee and sandwiches before our departure .there was nothing soothing , on the other hand , about the fellow hotel guests : volumes have been written and films have been made about this particular brand of tourist -- loud and generally unbearable in their behavior .most of the guests appeared to be on an all - inclusive plan </DOC> so those who did not seemed really to be taken advantage of .ditto at the bar , where the female bartender was rude and disinterested . </DOC> the outside areas are pleasant and no shortage of sunbeds . </DOC> - all very friendly and helpful .the hotel is kept spotless , very friendly staff thanks to our bar staff louis & daniel & nini who had always had a smile for us .all staff very cheerful and work very hard .indeed all the staff at the hotel were really nice and friendly .my fifth visit , but my first with a lady . </DOC> staff absolutely amazing ( apart from the receptionist that checked us inshe was a bit dour ! )food was excellent and there was always plenty of choice - </DOC> but this looked ok and the reviews were passable .the pool bar was only opened for food from 12 - 1 pm, i do feel that if proper food was put on in the pool bar more people would stay round the pool and enjoy their day better .i have to say the food was quantityafraid would only give the food 3 star maximum ."
52,"staff are excellent .good welcome and friendly staff .we were greeted with a delicious welcome drink on arrival andthe restaurant staff were all , without exception , friendly and helpful .but if you could find a sheltered spot round the pool area it was fine . </DOC> the service at the pool bar was good with lovely staff .the food was good always finding something tasty to eat .just back having stayed there for new year , food excellent , staff very polite and helpful .so they got one of there technical staff to trycheck in was professionally and helpfully handled . </DOC> again the staff were excellent , management , reception , in the restaurant , cleaners and last but not least the three lovely entertainment girls .the staff are friendly , efficient and ever so helpful .special mention to bar staff , jonathon , dadmar , louis and juan :)the chamber maids did a good job every day and were always friendly and helpful .the food was excellent and always plenty of choice , in fact i ' ve put on a little weight after my stay ;) </DOC> you do a great jobif someone reads this at the hotel he is a great asset .the staff were great .food was very good andthe kitchen staff worked hard as did the table staff ..... </DOC> we were all inclusive and the food was good for buffet style .the food is plentiful and varied .richard is his usual self , love him or hate him he is richard .food is fresh and there is a good choice .visited the bar to ask for an espresso and was told the coffee machine did n't work and only instant available . </DOC> it did n't look anything special !i 'll start with the positives : we were looking for a ' quite ' hotel with everything ' in house ' for a 1 week break .the food was very good and there was never a time when i could n't find something i likedthe entertainment guy does a fantastic job .throughout the day he was courteous to the guests and rallied round organising various events including water polo , bingo , water aerobics , karaoke etc . </DOC> the staff was great .if you found this review of any help , please click below ... thanks .the bar shows all the good brands but you have to pay for them or take the cheaper brands in all inclusive , not a problem as such but only one local lager on tap which was not to everyone 's taste .so they ca n't be used , a cup of coffee after an evening meal is always nice . in house pianist couple nights a week is excellent .did spend some time around the pool which was lovely and warm </DOC> i do n‚Äôt think i would be back as the staff ruined it for me due to terrible customer service skills and bad attitudes .bar - the barmen were very friendly though there was aonly a limited amount of local drinks and mixers which you could drink on the all - inclusive tafiffand i found all the staff to be very hospitable and happy in their work .the food was very good and freshly cooked at each meal .we moved the following day from room 430 to 416 and were given a bottle of bubbly and a complimentary ticket for two to the spa for the inconvenience - a good start !"
53,"the towels --- well we agree with others -they are terrible , i would not provide towels of this quality to guests staying at my home !the food is provided in the main restaurant , and whilst it could be considered as repetitive , if one can desist the temptation to test all of the options of main course and dessert every day , then there is some variety !the food was ok .the common areas were pleasant . </DOC> , no they were both raw ! !some food was stone coldand i believe it was pre cooked then refrigerated and then placed under the "" hot "" lamps to warm up , there was also food by the cheese / pate stationthis hotel is very friendly and the service very good from all we met .the standard of cleaning throughout the hotel was very good and all concerned being really friendly etc . </DOC> and she told me that they had a limited amount of staff to clean the rooms .friendly staff who are always happy to help .not too many people arrive at once as check in was slow and there was only one couple in front of us .i struggled with the food , there was a distinct lack of labelling and where food was labelled it did n't helpi had a boiled egg for breakfast and selected one labelled "" 9mins "" cracked it </DOC> fresh & tinned fruit , 3 types of yoghurt , cold meats & cheese , scrambled , fried , poached , boiled eggs , bacon , tomatoes , beans , under cooked sausage .on a couple of occasions we managed to get freshly cooked omelettes which were fantastic .the staff where very helpful and could not do enough to help-the main problem with this hotel is that the level it strives for is very mixed .whilst i would not agree with the 4 star rating , i found the hotel very pleasant and the staff were excellent , if not many in number ! ! </DOC> we arrived at the hotel just before 10 pm to find a queue to book in and the restaurant was closed .and not even a stach available .on the day of checking out we had the all inclusive band removed and was advised that we could have a lunch and drinkbut after that we had to paty for drinks and coffee .i spoke to the housekeeper </DOC> but its met more with humour - bar staff ( including oscar and mohamed )all very polite -adults only certainly helps , never a rush for sun beds , spotlessly clean and food very good ( though for stays of over 10 days you may want to pay a visit into el medano to try a tapas bar ) everyone of the staff are polite , admittedly more than others ( see below ) , receptionists more than helpful also .maria and ileana in the poolside bar always smiling ,it is certainly not a 4 star hotel i would say at the most a 3 star . </DOC> breakfast was fine .soundproofing clearly not a priority .staff were efficient .bars short staffed only 1 person on trying serve , wash and clear tables .best thing was the staff all pleasant and hard working .. </DOC> was very organised and slick .room staff need to check such things as a matter of course .the bar tended to be staffed by only one person , who was expected to serve and clear away .this was not the fault of the bar - person , who , like all the staff , worked really hard .the policy of the hotel is not to accept families with children what make me disapointed about this place from the beginning but after spending 1 week there i changed my opinion and it is really good idea - just another way of having rest ."
54,"positive points to note .add to that the good rooms , good food and friendly and helpful staffbut we did expect better service and more areas to access the free wi fi which was advertised on the website .free wi fi was only available in the noisy sand bar where the waiter service was very slow .shows and competitions were held here </DOC> a - absolutely fabulous , attentative and courteous staff .from checkin to checkout , we ‚Äô ve had our queries and questions answered in the most professional manner .all the staff are extremely polite , courteous and obliging .all the staff were very friendly and always said hello or asked how we were , from the gardeners to the spa staff ( which i visited twice for back massages ) .the lady greeter in the restaurant always knew which villa numbers we were in and the waiter hassan was attentive and decorated our table beautifully for my birthday . </DOC> we were in 263 nice large roomwe had a kettle so as a brit it was great to make my cuppa in the morning( i got some milk from the staff )we were all inclusive which was definitely worththe sea breeze restaurant did afternoon tea </DOC> that after screaming over the phone .i ca n't understand why reviews which point out the not so good points get unhelpful votes as i think this is what tripadvisor is all about .we decided to stick with the standard room after reading reviews on this site , and i would agree that they are the best choice .service all round is very friendly and personable and the best we have experienced in the maldives to date .on the return we only had to leave at a very civilized 14:15 . - the front desk staff were very welcoming , helpful and efficient . </DOC> the buffet restaurant was the main dining for all meals ( depending on what board you booked ) .the food was very same same every day , became boring on a daily basis ., i expected the meal to be special .the boat transfer was $ 95 return for each person .the staff were wonderful , </DOC> reception and check in was smooth .staff is very professional and polite and the atmosphere of the resort is amazing .staff is superb and they guide you through all the steps of the hotel .our 8 year old daughter was always at the kids club where she was very friendly with the assistants there .each staff member here was helpful and genuinely nice they all seemed happy to be working there ! </DOC> the food at the breakfast buffet was good , loved the tuna sambal .spent a couple of days here recently , the whole island is the hotel , the various beaches around the island are beautiful , the staff were very friendly and catered for every need .paid $ 163 plus 21 % tax and service charge for half board in a deluxe room single occupant .my second day i was upgraded to a garden villa which was much nicer!!!the jacuzzi beach villas are also really nice ! ! !ask at the dive center or at the parasailing rental station!!!food at the buffet is passable but nothing to write home about ! ! </DOC> staff was great and tries to be as helpful as possible !as a single woman travelling alone to bandis island resort , i felt very welcomed and safe by all the staff at this resort , commencing with their friendly assistance when i arrived at male airport in the torrential rain .their courtesy and assistance continued throughout my 4 day stay .they collect that on arrival , sothe + + comes from a 10 % "" service charge "" and 8 % gst ."
55,"they have a lovely reception for returning guests , but i ' m afraid it 's doubtful we would return again .this island resort has beautiful beach but compared to other nearby resorts in the area ( e.g. , full moon ) , it is not as impressive .food is okay and staff are friendly .not a single staff has smile on his / her face .house keeping is useless . </DOC> when i contacted the resort to make sure they had a record of our stay i received an instant reply , which made me feel comfortable that we were in professional hands .it was also a pleasant surprise that speciality coffees were also includedservice is very patchy and there seems to be both good and bad .the restaurant sea breeze is very nice and the staff here seem to be a little more attentive - the food is good here which os more than can be said for the main dining restaurant which serves a buffet -the thai restaurant is pretty good </DOC> however only one guy at the restaurant was quite cooperative who helped us to get good food .but again you have think twice before asking for any service even if you 're paying as they mostly in bad mood .our accommodation was immaculate and kept that way all week by the dedicated housekeeping staff .each member of staff we encountered were great and always happy to help a credit to their profession .i was happy with my room as it had a ceiling fan and the air conditioning worked well . </DOC> the island was very nice , the reef was ok , the food in the restaurant was very nice .the staff on this island are very kind and obliging and will do anything to make your stay more comfortable .it was a shame to see emply bottles lying around and rubbish lying around generally , why on earth people want to just throw rubbish onto the floor never ceases to amaze meand they obviously have no respect at all .the staff were very good , they do have a slow pace , but that his their way and is the same on other islands . </DOC> we took the full board option and was very happy with the food , there was a constant change andon the other outlets the sand bar was by far the best ..the staff were attentive and friendly ... but go to the other side of the island and visit huvanthe staff just do nt care , they are also pretty useless at serving you ,the only way i could get a drink on my first night was to go get it myself . </DOC> at the same time they were treating europeans like royalty .servers at the restaurants were not very trained and professionals .once i had to change dirty spoon two times and servers did n't show any remorse .as we arrived host informed us that our rooms have been upgraded .after a long flight we arrived and had to wait more then three hours to get ac fixed after they sent technician twice . to get extra bed which we paid </DOC> we had none for the return and that crew on the return were not going to just hand them out for love no money ! ! ! !but once we had met pete the rep who brightened our spirits and whisked us off to the jetty for our speedboat transfer we were on a high again !we were met with a cold towel and a drink and check in was relaxed .i ' m not certain bandos staff can spell "" service "" . when transferring money ( bandos refused to accept a credit card payment . ) , "" madhu "" was emailing me on a daily basis .once the transfer had been effected , she ceased email correspondence , ignoring my requests for confirmation the transfer had been received for two months , finally confirming one week prior to my arrival . </DOC> the food was also very good .we stayed half board and the food was as expected .the welcome , the staff , the spa -at the same time very expensive . since we are locked in , there is no other place to shop or dine , they take advantage of guests .also we notices they were not very attentive and friendly to asian ."
56,"well worth the supplement .the manager was kind enough to explain the layout of the resort and provided us with maps and the initial shock came after they added a hefty tax amount to my bill and took the payment in full .the next shock came to my entire families woesin the mean time the manager provided us with free buffet breakfasts whilst we waited and took us on a guided tour of the entire resort .the staff were very friendly , always smiling . </DOC> az l staff that is approachable and helpful for the most part .my booking.com reservation stated that airport transfer was included , but the receptionist at bandos disagreed and charged me again .at 94usd per person that was not a nice surprise ... other than that , the whole vacation experience was fantastic and made me quickly forget the unfriendly incident .staff were very friendly , service excellent and we thought it was good value for money .but the hotel had really disappoint me big time beside than the food quality which really poor and the service mind of the staff that i would say at zero level ... </DOC> i feel like they have no passion in what they are doing ...the thing that concern me the most is that , the last 2 days of our stay , we were sitting and enjoying the sun in the late afternoon , suddenly there are a group of guy ( i think they worked for hoteli wonder if the management know about this ? ? ? ? ? ...maldives weather has been showery , mainly at night , and often cloudy during the day but , with an air temperature of 29 degrees and a water bottom temperature ( diving ) of 28 - 29 degrees , this is a lovely holiday climate .we found the resort 's guests to be pleasant , conservative and active . </DOC> email communications with the resort concerning transfers was effective and timely .we stayed in a deluxe room but were disappointed that it did not have the four poster bed shown in all the brochures .the curries were tasty but not as spicy as i would like .but that 's not really the point of the maldives .about half of the guests at the resort are chinese , most of whom appear to be hard of hearing . </DOC> staff generally friendly and efficient .how to start this review ?examples are when they quote all prices exclusive of taxes , service charges etcwe ' ve been to .all the staff were friendly and courteous . </DOC> we waited about 30 - 40 minutes to be placed in a room , but since it was early in the morning we were pleased .the room decor could be updated and it would be nice to have a bit of artwork in the room , but it was large , clean and servedtransfer by boat which was very pleasant and unusual for a package holiday .meals were good and staff excellent .we were met by courteous staff offering cold towels and fruit punch . </DOC> bandos did give us a small discount as my gf works for an airline - a nice gesture .the buffet at the main restaurant is cafeteria quality food .staff was very nice .the staff on the island were excellent ‚Äì very friendly and helpful at all times .then , they gave us a room with double bed instead of clearly stated and several times confirmed twin . </DOC> the service by everyone at the resort was fantastic as well .in any case , thank you to all the staff at bandos for a wonderful stay !i had read up on the resort and was happy to hear that they had a great house reef ( love to snorkel and scuba dive ) on my first snorkel outingbandos really needs to do something about this if they want the fish to remain .at my first encounter with them , i was a little put out that you are made to pay for a "" orientation dive "" or as all other divers call them , a refresher dive ."
57,"reception is also very tired . also be aware that most accommodation outside of main high rise , is 3 storey with no lifts .our building was ' deluxe tropicale ' so over the road from reception and felt a total lack of security .the check - in was fineand we again contacted the reception and asked for a room change .one of the many very friendly and helpful staff members showed us various rooms so that we could decide . </DOC> nice welcome when we arrived .staff were friendly and helpful . </DOC> some of them are warm and welcoming , alas many of them are "" grumpy "" and make you feel like they are doing you a favour by serving you .the waitress ( noa ? ) was incredibly rude and the table sat there for 30 minutes before anyone appeared .given i stayed for 2 weeks , i was able to observe daily there is a real problem .i note this has been observed by many other reviewers , centara management need to address this inferior customer service ...the way guests are welcomed to their hotel by the staff is a very important part of the holiday experience . </DOC> the staff were naturally friendly and this had not been taught out of them , by the money men making the hotel overly efficient .everything was efficient and achieved in a friendly and professional manner and no staff member passed without a smile and a comment .there are three blocks which seem to enhance the volume levels , which are not helped by the desire of the staff in the bar to play music at nightclub decibel levels .i ' ve seldom stayed in a hotel where i found every single staffs that i ' ve encountered during my entire stay unsatisfactory .in particular the front desk staffs , they are not only rude , but extremely unhelpful and very unprofessional . </DOC> the frontdesk staff it - selves is enough reason for me to never again return to this property in the future .i was travelling as a very large group ( 16 ppl ) </DOC> check in staff were welcoming and friendly .breakfast choice was plentiful although the service from the staff could have been more attentive .pool at the terrace was nice , no kids .they also did n't seam to mind if you took your own beer to the pool .usual buffet breakfast but </DOC> expect to queue for a seat if you get up late .however , when we arrived the reception was confused and claimed that we only had booked for 4 adults , no children , and the transfer was not prepaid .even when i showed them our booking and payment confirmation showing 4 adults , 2 children and 2 private cars for airport transfer , i had to sign on a new transfer booking , and still only for 4 adults- no children .with no complimentary wifi , i went to a cafe to send the hotel reservation a mail , and asked them to tell the reception that we already had paid for 2 private cars for 4 adults and 2 children .the evening before check out we got invoice for 2 private cars for airport transfer , and i had to go back to reception to tell them once more about the mistake . </DOC> after some research the reception deleted the invoice .the morning after we waited 10 minutes for our 2 private cars .none of them came .i am not saying a flat screen tv would make all the differenceall of the staff were great and very friendly ."
58,"we had room service a couple of times and the food was nice and reasonably priced .breakfast was brilliant serving from 6.30am until 11.00am .if you are planning a visit enquire about the rooms in the tropix area only you have a better pool and people around the pool were saying they were more modern .ok depends what you want i would not really say its a family place with the girls ( thai ) out looking for the men .the staff are not very customer caring in the mornings at breakfast </DOC> many hotels now have a green policy which is great but staff need to be educated .refill the bottles etc .breakfast is certainly adequate butbreakfast was excellent .however , many inconsistencies with the restaurant and bar staff ( a couple on reception too ) . </DOC> it may be of interest to the young pool bar staff but a pain to guests .the cons : the staff does not speak the level of english you might expect at a resort like this staff screws up and managers blames the guest .the night manager nadineyou ca n't leave your kids in the kids room unless they are over 5 unless you upgrade prepare to be in a tiny room .but it surely gives them a run for value for money and the hospitality that the staff makes you experience . </DOC> centara did their best to resolve with our agent travelbag who were non responsive , but eventually after a week it was resolved .it was the best think we donethe hotel was clean comfy rooms and close to the beach breakfast lots of varieties to have and delicious the staff extra helpful only one problem too short staythe reception staff were welcoming and friendly , although we did have to wait a little while for our room to be ready .the check - in was a cinch and was handled very well . </DOC> i understand all about the tropics having lived in tropics for over 20 years , so i kind of excepted it .we had operated the air con all night on a constant 23 so did not understand how we had such a wet floor .we had breakfast in the azure restaurant every morning and there was a good selection and the staff were very friendly .i think was very helpful and even rang them for us to assist us .in fact all staff we met were very friendly and helpful . </DOC> and they are not very quick at clearning your plates away .if you have any complaints the reception staff suddently can not speak english .the staff are wonderful and met a lovely lady called dang who served us coffee most mornings at breakfast -her smile and small chat ( limited english ) was a highlight of our morning .they also skimp on simple amenities like coffee . </DOC> the staff is extremely friendly and makes you feel home .the lotus was disorganised and cramped .the service at this hotel is first class .many thanks to chea and kanin , but all staff were very helpful during our stay .walk to beach is not child buggy friendly but possible with care . </DOC> , it was nice .we were there in rainy season and the pool bar was still open every day apart from one and the prices are fair until happy hour when they become stupidly cheap .breakfast was fantastic and loads of it on a huge buffet but is no longer served in the main body of the hotel , you do have to walk 30 yards to get it and at busy times , wait about 3 minutes for a table .i only mention this because no doubt one of the miserable "" b""s that were moaning about it whilst we were there will be eager to tell everyone .the housekeeping staff opened the door every time they made up the room"
59,"we had a very warm welcome at this hotel , with drinks and cold towels . </DOC> the staff were excellent as in all thai establishments we have come across which is a credit to the people and country .the staff , ( as are all the thai people ) were very friendly , nothing was too much trouble .our rooms were adjacent at our request ( although as others have mentioned on this site , the staff 's english at reception is not greatgreat service by helpful and friendly staff .pool service was good and we enjoyed our stay . </DOC> the staff at the resort were brilliant with a mention to be made here for bo .she was outstanding .i must also complement the staff who were excellent , very helpful and friendly , made our stay most enjoyable .service in the bars was efficient and not too expensive and the food at breakfast was tasty and filling .we saw many young children , unsupervised handling food in less than hygienic ways . </DOC> i found the reception staff excellent .also the staff were friendly and helpful . moving luggage was no problem .their service was very good and they offed us free wifi during time stay because we have a member card from them .the beach was fair , nothing i 'd go back to .but a good service </DOC> we also have high regard for head concierge man deen who is always so polite and helpful .all the staff were courteous , happy and helpful as has been the case on our previous visits .as usual the staff were fine , the breakfast was good , the apartment was spotless with everything working ok . was booked into a room on the top floor by mistake , was moved the very next morning to a ground floor room .the rooms were spotless as usual , the staff were attentive as before , we 'll be back in 2015 all being well .the staff are excellent and are helpful and smiling . </DOC> this meant we had to hang about for over a hour , and the welcome drink was as bad as it looked served on a strangely shaped glass .the pool area was very nice , plenty of activities for the children .the reception was good , staff helpful and always smiling .a special mention for deen on the concierge staff who was forever helpful and always had a smile on his face .meals in the azure restaurant were well presented and exceptional value for money . </DOC> - in was friendly , welcoming and went without a hitch .the grounds of the hotel are well maintained and the breakfasts were adequate nothing fantastic or out of the ordinary but enjoyable we dined mostly at the azure restaurant as we found it less crowded .our special thanks must go to the staff of the mix bar who were extremely friendly and always had a smile for us .the staff were always smiling and greeting us .check in was drawn out , although we arrived in the afternoon , our room was not yet ready and the staff were reluctant to tell us this . </DOC> we thought we might shift out after 1 day and the staff were incredibly helpful with our enquiries about doing this - so well done to them for helping us work out our options .check in was very slow .check out was quick but they did want to do a check of the rooms before we left which took about 5 mins .the hotel grounds are well maintained , the staff friendly and excellent as expected of the wonder thai people , special mention to the staff at the azure restraunt werethe transfer was smooth , and check"
60,"no smiles at check - in .as a hotel guest , i wanted to take a peck at the restaurant facility and the staff gave me weird looks .my two nights stay was pleasant enough .the hotel entrance was small , concierge was friendly and helpful .check in was very efficient . </DOC> the ground lobby as well as the main lobby on level six were not big .they do n‚Äôt belong to any loyalty programme and are rather inflexible in granting upgrade and late checkout .about the same cost as le meridien next door under spg marriott and owned by the same taiwanese owners . </DOC> check in was smooth as expected and staff , professional and efficient .it is a green hotel but this lighting ( or lack thereof ) was particularly welcoming .service and staff are efficient and very good .check in and check out were seamless , and the bar has a nice selection of drinks .the staff were not particularly friendly but they were professional . </DOC> and i sat in baking sun holding an umbrella .the hotel also had the cheek to charge me extortionate rates for a late check out , i would have understood if the hotel was full , but if the room is free , they could have offered me a fair rate for a few hours . or a complimentary room for a shower as i have had in the past at other hotels .overall its nice , but i think for the money you can find better service . </DOC> we were checking out early the next morning and were about to rest , told them on the first call that we had no need , but somehow they were persistent and called 2x more .the rooms are a bit small , but served our purpose well with good service from the cleaning ladies to front - desk reception .in particular , deborah from reception was very helpfuleven with all the many light options they havethe staff by the pool are very fussy and insist on wearing a swimming cap at all times and they will not open the umbrella if there is a slight wind . </DOC> the toto washlet is really excellent , but the shower really stuffs it .service was very good at the pool and fitness area and the pool view was amazing .service on the ground floor taxi / bell boy was very good too .however , the front desk was quite bad , when we asked them about bar areas they did not make an effort to help us with itthey were not all smiles unlike the fitness and ground floor staff either . </DOC> did n‚Äôt have breakfast there but tried the pub , drinks and snacks were good , service was slight slow .and it 's not great value for money .the staff were friendly .the room service were excellent .we were welcomed through a sit - down dinner by our gracious chinese taipei hosts in this hotel and everything was just exquisite . </DOC> joined two business dinner in the hotel and the staff tried to accommodate my request for vegetarian option !the restaurant downstairs was also good .staffs were attentive butthe front desk staff and bell boys provide terrific service .they were so helpful when we ask them to book restaurant for us or when i enquire directions to certain places ."
61,"had some issues with them before and apologies were made which was good , however there was still something not right about the staff attitude here , kinda up and down .at the same time , just when you thought you would be offered an upgrade or something after staying with them for at least 5 times in less than 7 months but no , not even anything special or extras were offered .restaurant is nice and food is good , breakfast spread and quality also fine .service very friendly and professional .check - in was smooth and staff was generally friendly . </DOC> as others have commented , the rooms are smaller , however , the hotel more than compensates with courteous , warm hospitality .staff are pleasant and attentive .but u will never chill ....anyway ... maybe ok to stay 1 night ....not that bad humble house ... just not worth it ... </DOC> i was transitting at taipei and chose to have an overnight stay at the humble house .this is the kind of hotel i ' m reluctant to recommend to others in casegood services , good breakfast and friendly staff .the concierge is very helpful and friendly .it 's "" younger sibling "" - the humble house . </DOC> and that 's really more than satisfaction for the level of staff care and honesty .check in was swift , we arrived well after the check in time of 3 pm .the service is excellent , very kind , prompt and efficient .that hotel has similar styling and larger room but feels cold and lacks the friendliness of the humble house -- and is about $ 100 more expensive .paying full wack for a hotel ; i 'd want to write about an excellent stay . </DOC> he basically treated us like some cheapskates who just wana sit at the completely empty lounge .he is very rude and demand us to order now or get out kinda attitude .... very fed up ! ! !check - in was done professionally and efficiently with the warm and friendly attitude which is a signature of taiwan .great service staffs .they can speak english . </DOC> t service & facilities : the staff are professional and friendly .the service was top notch as per what i expect from most taiwan hospitality industries .good : 1 ) check in and check out were very smooth .the staff at the reception and concierge speak very good english and were very helpful .3 ) breakfast was good . </DOC> breakfast was a feast , very attentive staff , in fact the staff are avery good in all areas .staff are friendly , helpful and communicative .this was my first stay at the humble house .service is excellent , very friendly and efficient .i find the staff at this hotel very cold and not so friendly . </DOC> nevertheless , there were nice hot coffee ( self service ) in front of at the reception desk -- a very nice touch .the staff is helpful , although probably not the most informed in terms of concierge service .they have a very nice bar but everything closes fairly early in terms of food .very helpful and friendly staff .sabrina at the front desk is more than helpful"
62,"there is also an additional charge for using the pool ! !however , the management of the breakfast service at this hotel is very poor .once you ' ve been seated , it 's like feeding time at the zoo as you have to queue again to get food and other customers are snatching at the limited food on offer .staff are n't able to keep up with the supply of food - for example the scrambled egg and coffee kept running out .there are only two toasters , which is n't enough for the number of people the restaurant needs to feed . </DOC> used the luggage storage as we arrived early by train .. this was done very professionally .staff are very welcoming and professional .i really impressed of their service ..especially their conciergestaff was friendly , albeit a bit unflexible ( our request to check - in half an hour before the official check - in time was refused without even checking whether a room would already be available ) . </DOC> staff were friendly & helpful , room was small , especially the bathroom , which reminded me of a bathroom in a cruise ship cabin ; raised floor , tiny space .we stayed at the new miyako kyoto for 2 nights at the end of november and we were quite impressed .the hotel was extremely busy during our stay , and they do not allow check - in for anyone prior to 2 pm .the facilities are great and the staff are very helpful , with very good english .staff helpful and friendly . </DOC> our room was non smoking and my other half who is very sensitive to smoke was very happy .very cheerful in there , and much cheaper than the hotel .so always feel welcomed and valued .spacious rooms and again very helpful staff .worked very well . </DOC> the concierge services were excellent and helped navigate kyoto easily .staff regarded as friendly and be able to communicate in english with foreigners .the most remarkable drawback should be noisy in the reception lobby .many people , lodgers or not , were often found sitting around the lobby area and created a noisy environment when you approached the staff for check - in or check - out .the hotel must have any services inside , and something outside ( eg.restaurants ) </DOC> also if you wanted to make coffee in your room you had to ask at reception for the coffee as they only left tea on the room tray . stayed 3 nightsit does the job well if not with much style - breakfastis a buffet of the usual stuff which was ok .staff was helpful and the rooms were nicely designed and comfortable .it 's a very busy hotel and can appear quite impersonal but the staff were lovely and helpful . </DOC> and , the staff speak english .they all look good ( though i used only one of them ) but rather pricy .hotel staff are polite and efficient .some friendly foods ., we stay 3 nights here , very pleasant service as expected , if convienent is you are looking for ? </DOC> -breakfast was not as good as tokyo hotel and more expensive .-service in hotel good and helpful .extremely clean and very helpful staff .breakfasts were good and plenty of choice although the restaurant can get very busy .the concierge spoke good english and was extremely helpful check in is at 2 pm"
63,"no drinking water bottles in the room .great wifi and friendly and helpful staff .staff are helpful and courteous .again , this is inexcusable in this day and age .one could do much worse given the reasonable price . </DOC> well equepted and very helpfull front desk that speak english .maybe 6 am would be a better time to open ? check - in and check - out was efficient and overall i would recommend the hotel , but you should ask for a quiet room .the new miyako hotel has a superb staff with a good understanding of english .very friendly and accommodating staff .the concierge desk was excellent and we received helpful advice on things to do and how to get to places ( without having to go to the tourist office in kyoto station which was perpetually crowded ) . </DOC> it is a large hotel & the lobby always seems to be busy , but we have never had to wait for anything as there are lots of attentive staff , most able to speak adequate or better english .very large hotel - but staff very helpful and friendly , but it is very impersonal due to its size , e.g. 10 front desk staff ! ! just across the road from main station .this could only have been due to sloppy housekeeping , as the bathroom was clearly ready for new guests .staff very friendly ..service is really excellent . </DOC> reception staff speak english and are friendly , helpful and efficient .first time there , hotel reserved for a business trip by a japanese colleague , very positive experience .very professional staff , excellent service and high quality breakfast .i stayed there april 2012 and is very happy with it .all hot food bowls were empty ! </DOC> free , reliable and fast wi fi throughout .arrived at ten to 1:00 pm three days ago , their check in is at 2:00 pm .we are two elderly seniors , my wife was not feeling well , and i asked the reception clerk at the left corner if we could check as we arrived .she said no , check in is at 2:00 pm , but then i asked her to consult with her supervisor .he said we could check into the room at 1:40 pm , not a minute earlier . </DOC> she wrote it up for us .well ... a hotel with hundreds of rooms is not a bullet train ... the peculiar time , 1:40 pm ,betrays contempt , teasing , ill will ...the next day was a holiday ... celebrating the elderly ! ! ! !evidently the managers do not take note of that celebration . </DOC> breakfast was a self service buffet and was quite adequate .there were 2 restaurants available for breakfast but , despite the usual queues , we never had to wait long .service was average .reception staff was helpful .all in all had a good stay . </DOC> hotel suffered a little from the "" big hotel "" syndrome , with a bit of a tour - packed lobby , though staff were generally helpful .checking in was smooth .the cupboard could only hang about 3 - 4 coats or jackets , as the bar to hang from ran back to front rather than from side to side .service was excellent with immediate help when we could not figure out the tv . included breakfast was a buffet with lots of choices .-no coffee supplied in room , just tea ."
64,"so it is hard to give a comprehensive review , the staff were very good , the hotel comfortable .service is fairly good , but you would expect more for the price you pay .wi - fi available only at the receptionthere are loads of helpful staff .aircon in the room was not upto the mark breakfast spread was very average . </DOC> the staff in all departments were friendly and good .the food services in the hotel were crowded for breakfast because of all the tour groups , but the service was still reasonably good .stayed here for 3 nights , we had been very lucky with our hotel choices in japan before arriving here in kyoto , therefore on arrival we were slightly disappointed , the hotel seemed tired and the room was small and a bit dingy with no view at all .the lobby was always full , i think that a lot of tour companies must use this hotel .staff helpful and plenty of people on the desk . </DOC> through 3 emails we got the whole thing resolved .all the staff spoke english , and they have two computers for guest intenet use , free of charge .very nice rooms , helpful staff especially the conciergestaff was helpful and respectful .on arrival , the lobby is attractive , but unless you are sleeping there , be prepared for ultra - cramped rooms and minimal attention to guests . </DOC> i ' ve noted other comments about the poor service at breakfast on this sitei can only hope they will start to listen to feedback from their customers and take action accordingly .given their failure to act on other comments on this site , do n't expect change anytime soon .did not eat there as the station is full of good and economical places .service was good and the staff helpful . </DOC> so we joined the people sitting around the foyer until on the dot of 2 half a dozen stafftook their places behind the deskand it was good to go .check in guy was ok , little english , and not particularly friendly . </DOC> out of the 3 hotels i stayed at last week while in japan , this was my least favorite .breakfast buffet was okay but lacked the selection i found at other hotels .so please , can management strive to have a safety box in every room ?i concur with another reviewer here that it 's catered for international tourists , with staff who speak fluent english , which makes our stay a little easier .the service in the restaurant for breakfast at least was very poor . </DOC> staff are excellent !a fridge and a kettle / beverage making material were supplied .the staff we dealt with were helpful and pleasant ( which we found to be the norm in hotels and restaurants in japan ) .many of the staff spoke english and were incredibly helpful .breakfast service was excellent in the coffee shop . </DOC> office desk with good chair .the bars and eating areas lack atmosphere , but since they were mostly empty , i assumed that people ate elsewhere .inad√©quate seating for breakfast resulting in very long queues .paper thin walls allowing one to easily hear even quiet talking in neighbouring rooms .had always thought this was a friendly place despite always being busy , but how times have changed ."
65,"wide selection of foods . attentive servers .this means that there are often lines for the front desk and especially the breakfast rooms .straff are helpful and the lobby lounge ( no breakfast there ) is very nice .staff are very helpful .staff were very friendly and offered every courtesy and assistance when requested . </DOC> large souvenir shop in the basement .two restaurants serving breakfast .we were booked into two different rooms , check - in staff were a bit abrupt and not very friendly and we decided to stay in the double room .breakfast was nothing special , not a lot of western food and was very busy , we tried the room with the american breakfast but changed after the second day as it had less western food ?i do n't think the breakfasts are worth the $ 25.00 with limited choice of food . </DOC> service was quick and efficient .the restaurant breakfast was very good - plenty of food , good quality with a number of rooms to choose from .it is a larger sized hotel and the lobby looks very nice .staff at reception are very good and all can speak some english .the breakfast served in ronde restaurant is very good with regard to quality and variety . </DOC> it is not the 5-star luxury hotel of shinjuku , but pleasant .they have a nice eco - friendly room cleaning option ( the skeptics will call it a labor reduction / cost saving option ) .staff at all three breakfasts could speak english and always courteous .checkin & out smooth lovely people & able to leave my bag there till 6 pm whilst undertaking a day tour .the staff in here were lovely esp the fellow topping up coffee . </DOC> when we asked to have a room at least now as she knew we were already there in the morningi asked her the cost she clearly did n't know the answer .we realized that this hotel operates like an airport and not as a hotel , as they do only checking after a certain time and create queues in the lobby .there is a small refrigerator that was very helpful to keep some cold drinks and little food or fruits .there are several restaurants and breakfast was possible to eat where they had western food , very good , abundant and very pleasant settings . </DOC> the staff was very helpful and many spoke english .the service of the staff was good and they could speak basic english .( i did not get his name ) was very friendly and we would always engage in some chit - chat everytime we left and returned to the hotel .very nice facility with many dining options .staff is nice but little english here . </DOC> this is one busy hotel but the level of service is maintained to a very high standard .the front desk staff are really goodi even saw managers taking it upon themselves to double as lift attendants in the mornings when things became very busy .the service in the kyohamasaku japanese restaurant was also god , possibly slightly better than the food which is very unusual .breakfast was adequate , catering mostly to japanese taste , as could be expected . </DOC> not personal feel to the place at all .though the few staff we dealt with were helpful .masses of people , all with trays , elbowing for room to get food and drink .what food we had was just ok .so bring other forms of entertainment for those times you are in your room resting and relaxing ."
66,"all they said was at this time of year the heating is on but not the air .it 's a very large , very busy property , and i was impressed at the very efficient way they handled checking in so many of us in a timely manner ., then waiting for immigration to recheck passports , checked luggage returned , etc , so it was very nice to be handed a room key , breakfast coupon , and wifi access codes as soon as we arrived .service was efficient at times .the lobby looked like the gate area in an airport - and not a very nice airport at that . </DOC> 1 . not all hotel staff are friendly .the check - in staff at north hotel was very nice and friendly on our arrival day- she was very patient and cared to explain the details as we needed to switch to the main hotel on our 2nd and 3rd night .luggage handling department , the junior staff were far better than the man in the blue jacket .the junior staff a guy(when </DOC> we placed our luggage for storage ) and a girl ( when we collected our luggage ) , was very good and smiled to us and helped .each guest has a personal log - in password to the wifi which is a wee bit slow .fair selection of japanese , western and even some moroccan food ,checkin was fine , the room was perfectly usablestaff is cooperative with true japanese hospitality - courteous , smiling and responsible . </DOC> working order - wifi was free and the signal reliable and robust .i think i inhaled a year 's worth of second hand smoke in my 4 day stay on the premises - not cool .both times staff only provided the requested double bed after we insisted .wifi was advertised but turned out to be only usually available in the foyer and not working .i asked for support both to the reception and to the technicall assistance </DOC> the food seemed dried out and tasteless .staff spoke enough english to help us with what we needed .the only sour note was absolute refusal to let us have a room before the allotted check - in time of 2 pm .they were adamant that we could not access our room .calling the reception did not help . </DOC> ( last year was still cabled only ) , general service level has really become consistently poor and sloppy , not just japanese standards but internationally as well . misplaced , erroranoeous bookings and ignored requests for non smoking rooms over 4 out of last 6 visits .hotel duty managers ( at front desk at lobby level ) with relatively poor command of english and no empathy whatsoever when you bring issues to them . will lobby hard to strike this hotel if our approved list .if you are paying out if your pocket , look elsewhere .internet was free although the language implied that it was 1000 yen / day .i was never charged for it . </DOC> asked for addn mattress pad but housekeeping did n't understand what i was asking for .3 ) jpanese keyboard for interent in the lobby is incredibly frustrating to use .should have one english dedicated keyboard as most people using lobby internet were foreigners .time to recaulk or really scrub it down .ok i know tokyo is busy but the lobby is always packed out with suitcases everywhere . </DOC> the hotel staff was very nice and helpful with directions .hotel staff are also helpful and hotel location is superb as it is opposite shinagawa jr stn .the only negative point about my room is the sound proof issue where i can hear noise along the corridor and i will wake up daily around 6 am due to housekeeping staff working on their trolleys .staff are not very pleasantbut i would nt describe them as rude ."
67,"wise , the service should be higher though .so when we sleep there .. as we sleep on the rocks .. not comfortable .. for check in you must queue quite long ..there was a desk in the corner where you will barely have any room after you put your laptop on it .you would have to sit on the tiny sofa to use the desk .there are no chairs in the room . </DOC> you have to request an iron board and they would want take it away in an hour ., use of swimming pool ( 1000 yen per visit ) , extra for breakfast etc etc .the staff is courteous ( not a surprise in japan ) and the interiors are nicely appointed .the innumerable staff are very polite and helpful ( as all service people are in japan ) and quickly provided extra pillows and electrical adapters .english speaking staff were always available when needed . </DOC> lack of customer focus for sure .while there is no big department store to tempt the shopper we were happy enough with isetan 's deluxe food hall and supermarket at the station as well as eateries around the hotel .we checked in 3 times during our recent trip and it was mostly quick and painless - only once was i served by a newbie who seemed unsure and worked slowly .even the "" comforter "" appeared to be made of a plastic - like material that seemed to be made for easy and quick cleaning between guests .hotel staff were very helpful in booking bus tickets and accommodation on mt . </DOC> i have to praise the porter service which had provided prompt and patient service .front desk , though , was a different story .none of the front desk people were smiling when i checked in or checked out .them when i was checking out , , the front desk personnel coughed into my face , without covering her cough .other than the front desk , guest relations was great and provided excellent directions to attractions . </DOC> this is a big and very busy hotel .the service is excellent but the rooms are small ..... and you can not open the windows which i do not like . </DOC> the service was efficient and professional .i love that the staff at reception speaks decent english .we paid around 14,000 yen and were quite happy with the room and view from 31st floor .the customer service is topsand they were awesome in helping us figure out how to get to fedex to pick up a package that did n't come on time and needed it that day . </DOC> the staff were typically attentive and courteous , typical because i ' ve found over several years it 's the japanese way .the check in was very swift also because of the automated machines .then another long long walk and then three small rooms and a short staircase up to the pool which is almost with the effort ... good sized pool and good staff but very limited hours as they use it to teach lessons and is closed more than it is openalbeit like all the staff we met ... very little english spoken ... strangely like most of japanas a business hotel this would be quite nice -- there were irons and other equipment to borrow on each floor . </DOC> suffice to say this is not the ideal greeting to receive when trying to check - in after 24 hours travel .and how were we to know ?a luggage rack would be welcome ...so no time to interact with staff a few plug points near the bed is a necessity for a heating pad etc ... found these missing .breakfast saw the usual fare ... all in all a pleasant stay !"

70,"the staff are very helpful and the lobby and surrounds were nicely decorated for christmas .the front desk was efficient , if unwavering in their adherence to the rules ( a charge for early check - in , or for a late check - out ... even if only for an extra hour ) .you do not necessarily feel like you are getting personal service here .the hapuna restaurant has a nice breakfast buffet .as with most hotels in japan , the service is efficient ( even with long lines at check - in / check - out ) , room are clean and proper , and everyone is very polite . </DOC> front desk staff were helpful and attentive to minor needs and questions .good chance to experiment different kind of foods !the front desk is helpful and do try to book rooms at the main building itself .the staff bent over backwards to find an empty hotel room ( on the 35th floor ) with a view of mount fuji so that we could see it before we left .outstanding customer service like this was common all over japan . </DOC> next surprise , lift .. very old lift , somehow we managed to reach our floor .you can not turn and even you can not stand in the bath tub ..worst out of it is you can here what the next room guest speaks .even a small sound , be it tv volume or phone call .. it was disturbing the whole night ..highly not recommended to stay here . </DOC> check in was swift and our room was ready despite arriving in the early morning .none of the lobbies were particularly welcoming and were obviously designed for dealing with enormous quantities of people .they were reminicent of airport check in areas , vast echoing caverns with no redeeming features .check - in was super efficient .so i arrived at the "" right "" check - in desk and had no problems . </DOC> but i knew what i booked and was n't unhappy .as can be expected in japan the level of service and assistance is top level and everyone speaks some englishbut they do have excellent english speaking staff ( expats ) in the reception .tokyo is a difficult city for an indian traveller as everything seems so automated and the signages in english are limted .the breakfast is forgetable and repititive and evrything is costly . </DOC> communication is an issue .me and my wife feels like we are in a box .they only provide one pillow per person .and we came in to the wrong reception .so we have bunch of stuff to pack in the bags . </DOC> the staff pleasant , friendly and helpful .good reception servicewifi gave fast enough speed ! !everything in the annex was great from checkin , to the room to the checkout .i had good expectations since the lobby is nice but was greeted by an awful room . </DOC> service is fast and efficient and they even have an information corner with an english speaking staff member .breakfasts served in 2 restaurants fixed menus kind of international and buffet in huge place where you have to wait for 1/2 hour to get thereand then you have to wait again to get some kind of food ... as this place is too crowded !so never again prince hotel for me !at check in , in spite of the rush found the front desk most efficient and hospitable . stayed on the 37 th floor with good views of the city and mount fuji peeping through the clouds . had heard a lot about size of rooms in tokyo hotels but the prince room sizes are quite reasonable with economical rates ."

75,"my husband was so hungry that he kept it , but the server knew it was overcooked too and did not charge us for it .if you come to the lodge with the proper expectations , you will probably be pleasantly surprised .most of the staff was helpful and friendly .we stayed two nights - one would have been enought for the nostalgia .the front desk was ok .... </DOC> great people watching by the fire in the evening - the best bit of any national park lodge experience .i hated the place , but if you want a truly bare - bones experience just this side of a tent , in a room so tiny and cramped as to be comical with two people , then this is for you .food in the restaurant was good and service was efficient .if staying at one of these xanterra - operated places , be prepared for very little to no internet service , no tv , no phone service , no mini - fridge ... but there is a coffee / tea maker .in the middle of the lobby is a piano with a sign limiting the hours when the piano can be played . </DOC> the front desk staff probably set the poor tone of the , albeit short , stay .not helpful , not accommodating , to the point that i chose to move on .little things like helping with communication , rather than just shrugging shoulders and telling someone to move on go a long way .breakfast was good and set us up for a day trekking in the park .the lodge is unique , warm and the fireplace huge , though during our visit it was still too warm outside for its ' use . </DOC> the young workers were not only competent and helpful , they were pleasant . </DOC> i expressed my dismay to the manager the next morning and he offered a lot of excuses , but not much of an apology .we did call and they sent some towels to our room .that 's what a property manager is supposed to do .how could they forget an entire cabin ?most of the people working there were new , so they are not very helpful in providing information or directions . </DOC> there is a bar / coffee shop -but they do n't open it until 11 am , so you have to use the restaurant for breakfast .restaurant pretty good .the boat trip a must - the captain and guide was a sharp young man .forget anything such as blow dryer , coffee maker , tv , or internet </DOC> when we turned on the lights , one of the bulbs was broken .hotel personnel seemed motivated to please and i would stay here again , but would try to book early enough to get into the main lodge .management seems to be taking advantage of a captive audience since there are not many options in the park .when it arrived , the salmon was so overcooked that he could n‚Äôt cut it or even separate the flakes .the server returned it to the kitchen and after a long wait brought another one that was slightly better . </DOC> the buildings are old world style and enjoyed exploringthe staff appeared to be mainly made up of trainees or vacation workers , willing but not experienced .restaurant in the lodge was very good .very friendly personnel everywhere .the "" average "" rating i gave this lodging was only that high because of the front desk staff and a very good previous stay ."
76,"food is good at restaurant and that staff is pretty nice , but you 'd be better off putting up a tent and walking to the restaurant .we needed to clean up and get ready for an early dinner .we voiced this complaint with the management who did not appear to be very sympathetic .they were able to accommodate those leaving and those who were staying .the lake mcdonald staff seemed to not consider those who were staying more than one night . </DOC> the folks at check in did n't really care what they were doing .we were on a tourwe ate at the restaurant and although a slight mix up with the order it was soon rectified by the very helpful staff .the restaurant was too small and always had a line .the staff at the lodge was friendly and allowed us to move out two days early . </DOC> as others have reported there is no cel service and wifi is generally only in the lobby and think 80s dial up quality .had to go snatch some off the service cart in the aisle .we ate in the lounge and the main dining roomand we thought the food was very good and the service was excellent .if you know going in what you will get you will be happy , if you are expecting a 5 star resort you will be disappointed . </DOC> the restaurant is very nice , but you can still go in your hiking clothes .the staff was super friendly and very attentive .the drinks were nice and strong too .the service was exceptional , fast , helpful and friendly .once in all is good . </DOC> our servers were prompt and helpful .they also have a soup special daily .the staff was very welcoming and helpfull . </DOC> actually , we sweated when we went to bed , but froze when we awakened to temperatures in the low 40s .the hotel staff is excellent and friendly .front desk staff were friendly and efficient , as were the servers in the dining room .you get nice toiletries , coffeemaker with coffee and specialty teas , hairdryer , iron and ironing board , and an alarm clock .i reserved a "" small cottage room "" online , and wish now that i had called them to talk about the facilities before booking . </DOC> a basic priority system should be established to clean those cabins during a timeframe when most returning guests would be gone .obviously , this put a damper on an otherwise good experience here .she had to crawl from the end of the bed .a pleasant , kind and friendly woman at the front desk was a welcome sight !plus , the food and coffee were excellent . </DOC> the staff did try to fix it and got itdining room serviced by enthusiastic group of individuals from around the world , though service is slow and food is mediocre .2 double beds , comfortable enough .you can order a hiker lunch by 8 pm at the front desk for the next day , which we did and were very pleasantly surprised , both at the quality of the food and the low cost .the atmosphere by the lake is very pleasant for sitting after dinner and just watching the water ."
77,"how can they justify the price ?when we opened the door to our cabin ( wood siding ) , our mouths dropped with how nice it looked inside .the room had coffee / tea / hot chocolate supplies , but no tv , no phone ( a phone booth was available in front of the lodge ) .so we waited patiently , this is until others who arrived shortly after us got instantaneous check - ins .i think they assign cabins a day or so in advance and are totally inflexible about giving cabins to those who arrive a little early . </DOC> so , if you do n't pay for the more expensive units , you 're essentially just one or two steps up from from sleeping in a tent .the most annoying thing occurred upon arrival .the young man ( boy ? ) who checked us in seemed to take great pleasure in reading off a long list of rules and regulations -- very stiff , very unwelcoming .to top it offthe service at the checkout desk is very slow . </DOC> the employees seem to have a hard time using the checkin application and can not answer the simplest of questions .throughout our stay lines at the gift shop we 're long and people were frustrated .the restaurant service is slow but the food is good and there are many healthy options .after our first use of the pool we were not tempted to go back .go first thing in the morning . </DOC> we felt the employees were really trying hard to make the guest experience good but with little support from their corporate office that 's hard to do .special shout - out to tasha who served many roles .she made our experience better .the coffee was good as well .the server was friendly and accommodating . </DOC> all staff was very nice .if i 'd known how stuffy it was going to be i 'd have brought a portable electric fan .front desk was extremely disorganized .i am on a special diet and was toting a cooler of food with me .the facility to change and shower was so so and they ran out of towels . </DOC> it is by far the nicest of the three we saw : kalaloch , sol duc and lake crescent .kind of nice to soak in the pool for a bit .and you will not be surprised .yes , scenery and hiking are fabulous but i would stay elsewhere .staff is friendly but hapless , if you complain about housekeeping ( as we did ) they apologize but do n't do anything . </DOC> is n't that the opposite of what he should be doing - surely if short - staffed , you want to space out when people arrive to dine ?the food , by the way , was awful and way over - priced .or , another example , the duty manager took a phone call from a place in forks saying ' we have two people wanting to come up and spend the night at your resortalthough not at all obviously busy , instead of answering yes / no as you 'd expect, he said ' give me their name and number </DOC> the facilities are very nice but way , way over priced .requests given at reservations for one bed , are not passed on to local hotel desk , and therefore not honored .staff was helpful too .the riverside suite sits on top of the housekeeping department , the lost and found and the maintenance department .consequently , you hear the staff conversing all day and are awakened at 6:00 am when they start coming to work ."
78,"and it is also dog friendly .the staff were super friendly and we loved eating our dinner outside as the sun went down .there is a tv but the management told us they cut the service to this unit because the box brokeand they did n't want to fix it .management did bring us small fans to scatter about the unit . </DOC> i walked over and read the details off the tap handles .the pool policy and management has also deteriorated .service was friendly and efficient .the pools themselves looked well kept and temperature management was excellent .the restaurant food and service were both much improved on last year , too , and prices felt moderate / fair rather than over - priced . </DOC> after leaving the miserable quinalt lodge this was our next day booking .and they are , in my opinion , gouging the public and poorly managing these properties till their 10 year lease expires in a few years .it is near the end of the season and the staff has only 1 more month to go .you will not believe the attitude that welcomers you from the crabby old lady that checks you in to the apathetic teen that provides the free bfast .the management can not motivate them and only hope they will not quit till closing day . </DOC> the grounds and are nice and clean .you get a credit good for one year .so if you going to make a reservation with them , do it on you own risk .they do the reservation for olymphic national park .i have done park reservations in utah , arizonia , and wyoming without such fees . </DOC> lots of families with kids </DOC> decided to try and get a cabin for one night during our trip and were lucky to get the last one .lovely cabin which we enjoyed spending time in .the workers are very friendly and helpful .the staff were pleasant and polite , even when the crowds were stretching their patience ( saw some very demanding families with very high expections ) .the fish entrees and salads were quite good . </DOC> ( they said it would be rekeyed at end of season ... really ? ? ! )we needed to call the manager to finally get the breakfast voucher that was included in the rate .the hygenic conditions of the "" hot springs "" is really questionablehowever if you really want to get away from your business life , then without gsm coverage , tv and wifi , that 's the spot to be .the pool for the hot springs is not like the italian terme . </DOC> the staff was very friendly and went out of their way to be helpful .i enjoyed the pools very much .i did n't do that but booked on line with the reservation service .lovely drive through forest and great hot pools ."

85,"great food and service . </DOC> security do a good job of checking bracelets .management does n't seem to understand or care that those guests that stay in the luxury side of the resort are generally older and do n't like very loud music when they come to relax .the music was so loud we had to leave the pool area .and they have taken no action .called them again and they refuse to take my call . </DOC> there is nothing here for you .takes ages to clear off a table , or get a glass of water ..the servers are okay but not without attitude .the pool is pretty , but they claim no pool towels before 8 am , yet at 8 am , every lounge is taken , with towels , and the help gives you that dumb look .. its not pleasant to find a lounge .shout out to brandon & patricia in the buffet as they were really friendly and delivered great service . </DOC> the only bad part was that it was n't adult only and the staff did n't enforce the privacy so other people were using this part ofbut since we had a morning flight the lounge was n't openit did also feel that there was more staff per visitor in this section of the hotel and that the level of service was higher .as we watched them throughout the week wear shower shoes and socks , yell at the staff , and be generally classless ; it dulled our experience .i will say the front desk staff , bell boys , and butlers handled the situation wonderfully . </DOC> our check in went with ease and we were very impressed by the front desk staff .the beaches were not as nice as we like and food was just mediocre all - inclusive food .our favorite lunch was the jerk chicken right off the grill for lunch ‚Ä¶ awesome .the food was either very tough , raw and nopeople were very friendly , helpful , attentive , always saying good day and asking if there was anything we needed . </DOC> very pleasant and professional .tasty buffet food and drinks .we tried massages at the spa and they were excellent .the service was hit or miss .the staff of the hotel were pleasant and approachable , the vast majority worked very hard from what we saw during our stay . for one of the nights , our room was decorated with flowers , bath ran etc </DOC> the outside staff does an amazing job of keeping the place clean .the only drawback to this property , for me , was the customer service from the front desk staff .they were horrible and non - responsive to any of our needsseveral days we had to request face towels from housekeeping and it took hours for them to deliver them to the room .in fact , we were there for 4 days , and when our airline cancelled our departure flight , we were placed in another hotel for 3 additional days in montego bay and the customer service of that hotel was phenomenal ! </DOC> are just so warm , friendly and engaging .each day we were greeted with smiles at the excellent jasmine buffet and that set us up for the day .garden grill - steaks very flavorful maybe just a tad tough dolce vita - food was good .the social staff always had something going on in the afternoon .the way it was served tableside was a special touch , the service was excellent ."
86,"and it was like a private party every night - very nice .the staff is very friendly .the food is good but limited and we could n't be bothered to walk the 15 minutes back to the room , change clothes and go somewhere else and then change clothes again to go back to the beach .most super friendly ...but we are also friendly to them :) </DOC> staff throughout are good , and seem to really enjoy working here .when i did we got some wow service in return , they just need to stop that happening in the first place .they do make an effort to lift towels etc when people try to "" reserve "" sunbeds .anyway , they provide you a form to fill in your personal details , they did not ask for a credit card , they then provide you with some details on the hotel .all very professional and polite , after which they get a butler to take you up to your room . </DOC> most everyone was friendly and seemed to genuinely care .so . if you are a gucci girl , louis vuitton lady , jcrew guy , or villbequin guy , stay away , run fast ..service is so slow , behind island time .. they try and rip you off or sell you something every time you turn around , a vacation club discount , tours etc ..the buffet looks pretty but pathetic quality of food , more like recycle from the day before .if you want fine food , low in fats , cholestrol etc . </DOC> we suspect the interim had been a temporary solution but no one explained anything - big opportunity missed by management after this no issues , the occasional minute or two of down time inconvenienced no one .this review may be long and convoluted but i want whoever reads this to get a good idea of this resort .none of the restaurants we asked for on specific nights lined up .i did get the reservation i wanted after talking to them therebut i feel this should have been taken care of prior to us arriving . </DOC> the bathroom door did not latch , etc ‚Ä¶ .just things like that .and i want you to be informed before you decide to book this place .let me start by saying i ' m a senior reviewer on ta with over 157,000 readers .i write the truth .the good - the bad and the ugly . </DOC> the butler showed us around and got us settled which was really nice .the don pablo is table service throughout .we arranged the don pablo upgrade in advance of our arrival .these were the issues : multiple requests for the following were ignored : light bulb change over the makeup mirror , toilet tissue , facial tissue , facecloths , towels , ice , wine , orange juice at breakfast , etc .service was not performed and the room was not made up . </DOC> never got to eat anywhere else .customer service : 0, this ranking is mainly for the so - called management .( i think ) pool does not open till 9 am and bar 10 am , service round the pool was brilliant plenty staff taking drinks orders , the swim up bar had activities in pool throughout the day , from aqua aerobics to foam party , foam party not for mestaff : we were very happy with the majority of the staff . </DOC> although the flight was smooth and on time , the cabin is cramped and small .no televisions on board although you may rent an ipad for $ 10.00 and use the free wifi .no meals served although you can purchase , with credit card , a limited selection of snack foods .no duty free purchases on board .my friend that i travelled with wanted to go all inclusive after he had a fabulous time in mexico ."

88,"the dishes we had were also very tasty .the staff through out did not seem to care , and more than once i had to wait quit a while to get a drink while the staff finished their conversations .in the restaurants i had to ask just to get a refill for water . having worked in the food service management field for a number of years in 4 & 5 star hotels , water should never be asked for .i did not expect to have to argue with the waiter seating .we had a reservation , we went to the restaurant , and there was plenty of tables open </DOC> positives check - in was very smooth .the staff all over the resort were very friendly and greeted us with a beaming smile -‚Äú good morning / afternoon / evening / have a lovely day ‚Äù we were allocated a room on the 2nd floor of the windsor building .fumiko at check - in was extremely helpful and helped us a lot .this place has everything you need and want in an all inclusive . </DOC> the quality of service , food and drinks dropped down dramatically !if you go there , take good snorkelling equipment .food : we enjoyed every meal we had and the service was good and attentive .breakfast and lunch we usually had at spices which constantly had a variety of good food and nice wait staff .no waiting and the staff cleared the dishes so fast </DOC> this failed to materialise on either journey .i ‚Äô ve tried to be ‚Ä¶and since i am a breakfast person ... i would be remiss to not commend the staff at spices breakfast buffet ... so delish !i went for a day pass and was not overly impressed with this adult only resort .the staff were very friendly , but i would n't recommend eating there . </DOC> polite servers and boythe variety of drinks offered was excellent .if we could score the staff individually , they would hit 5/5 !firstly , as butler guests we received an invitation to update our account with our preferences and any special requests .we made a point of asking for the rolls royce transfer as shown on the website and even made this request ( numerous times ) to the sandals booking agent . </DOC> and i just do n't think they could understand our lack of usage .i also do n't agree that they are trained to ' london standard ' .i noted that some people would ring their butler from around the pool to get drinks ....... there was a bar not 50 feet away ........., we found the staff friendly and had a good chat with the general manager , we have booked up again for ocho rios again with 50 % off and are looking forward to this , to sum up this resort is not worth ¬£ 7500 pound per couple for a week buthalf price is more in line with the service you get . </DOC> the flora and fauna are lovely and the pools are huge and inviting .this is one of the top complaints and easily avoided .sandals makes it very clear what time you can check in to your room .the shuttle to the hotel was quick ( no problems ) and if you get sick of waiting for the shuttle for a few minutes , shell out ten bucks and take a taxi , nothing to get worked up about .- the grounds - stunning looking - butler service - we only got this as it was the only way we could get the room we wanted . </DOC> the other pool was much better but clearly if you did n't have a butler to get up at 4.00 am in the morningthe resort is excellent , staff is very nice , smiling 24h .staff - we found most of the staff really friendly and approachable , especially tanya on reception , she was lovely .from the time we arrived until the moment we left the service was excellent .the staff were always very pleasant ."
89,"the staff are very friendly and always greet you when passing by .the spirits in the room were cheap local versions and our fridge was n't refilled after drinking the cranberry juice - we had to ask twice for more .but the dj who was trying to be a comedian just got on my nerves .there were a lot of signs around about pool etiquette - but we saw people eating pizza in the pool , smoking and everyone was floating around drinking the drinks from the bar - why bother with signs about al of these if they are n't enforced .seriously pizza and smoking in the pool ! </DOC> spices used to be an an la carte restaurant serving really good food at night , now it is international buffet -the french restaurant is still fantastic at night but rediculously hard to book .sadly the breakfasts could be good as the menu promises , but service is stupidly slow and on our 3 visits we could not get a runny eggs bendict .butler service was helpful in securing dinner reservations , they had in fact made reservations for each night before we checked in .other than that , i would not say butler service was all that impressive . </DOC> , i ' ve ended up exchanging facebook details with staff , not this time .i ever been and lovely staff around staff are very friendly and enthusiasm to take care of the guest , lovely food and varieties of seafood , really love it and again and again will visit and recommend all my friends to be here during the vacation to spent the best time in paradise .some things were really exceptional and others really disappointing , especially considering how expensive sandals is compared to an upscale luxury resort in riviera maya .the evening entertainment with the dancers was great the first night , but got repetitive after that .so no effective change . </DOC> and i returned to reception to find out whether we could upgrade- we were told that we had been upgraded three categories ( because of my husband 's special birthday ) and that we could n't upgrade further , even to pay for , because the hotel was fully booked . as we had sea view ,service was non existent unless you paid for a butler .we did not have a butler .all the great reviews are from people who had butlers . </DOC> their pizza shack on the beach is great as ever .he was amazing !the good stuff :* butler service was fantastic , it was great to have our sunbeds reserved and also to get our dinner reservations sorted out up - front .there are eight restaurants on the resort , </DOC> our concierge guy was very informative but he really did want to sell the spa and amenities .the food in general is ok not exceptional .the butler service is nice , but uneven at this location .they would disappear for hours on end and just did n't provide good service .on that point they did a good job but did n't always sit us where we asked . </DOC> the pool bar was way under staffed , most of the time while we were there , there would be one maybe two people at the bar which let a lot of people standing around waiting .spices was a nice place for breakfast .the transfer via sandals transport was quick with us waiting no more than about 5 - 10 minutes for the bus . as you drive into the resort it is well set out andcheck - in was swift , friendly and informative all in one go .we ate al la carte in the evening and the french restaurant was excellent in food quality and service . </DOC> to begin with , i was not happy with the long wait to get my room .since people have to leave by 11:00am and the resort knows that saturday is a busy day for arrivals , they should be prepared for turning rooms over quickly .and they had to come to my room twice for that .people came twice for screen door .after they came , it fell off track ."

94,"the staff were very helpful and friendly however , by wednesday the resort started getting crowded and the more crowded it got the level of service greatly went down .no one came to clear plates , no coffee or tea was offered till we were almost finished with our breakfast and everyone clearly avoided eye contact so that we could n't ask for anything .the food is very good for an all inclusivethe best meal we had was at kimonos .entertainment was very poor - do you really want bingo in a sandals resort ? </DOC> their hospitality is genuine along with their broad smiles . despite some major disappointments our time was enjoyable saved by the locale and the staff .management needs to improve on their processes .after the very arduous check in process find yourself one of the senior managers and make an introduction .the baccarat restaurant is very hard to get in .the balmoral tower is generally the quieter of the two towers . </DOC> service , service , service- the sandals staff were so friendly and eager to please 2 .no beer , no champagne , not even soda or juice drinks offered or available ( miss ) .upon arrival check in was quick ( hit ) and we got our cool towel and champagne as we did the little bit of information still left to completethe staff are very good for the most part , and friendly . </DOC> we spoke with two different managers who promised to investigate the incident and get back to us .no one ever attempted to provide us with information .this resort has butler suites / room service and the best all inclusive in the bahamas .the butlers were very attentive , reserving tables for dinner , booking sun loungers , etc . , in the first weekour shower only had lukewarm water , never hot . </DOC> we had 3 butlers this time and they provided good service throughout our trip .we do n‚Äôt usually request much , but they did everything we needed in a timely and efficient manner .still took 2.5hrs to get into our room- all the while with no wifi !staff outside front desk is awesome .front desk staff did not seem to comprehend basic hospitality . </DOC> loved when 11 am came around and they were still empty , so they could be claimed by "" regular "" guests !the wait times for some of the restaurants is ridiculous !the first night we went to kimonos and were told 1 hour wait ; then went to casanovasrb really needs to adopt reservation system for all restaurants , not just at baccarat !given its location you would expect superb fresh produce and seafood , instead we got foot long hot dogs , rotten salads and burned burgers . </DOC> entertainment is of the worst holiday camp variety -unlessyear(2016),which was suppose to be a surprise , but sandals representatives ruined that by telling my husband the only flight available was at 12:35pm and arriving to the bahamas at 7:40pm , which took a whole day from us for travel .they blamed each other of course , so who is lying ?suite(room 411 ) , the young lady that greet us was nice at first , but later started rushing us due to it being late at night when we arrived to resort , and we wanted to book some a la carte restuarants for our stay and was told to wait until tomorrow(taking a risk for them to be booked up ) .butler service from yorlet , cory , and </DOC> thank you so much for all the wonderful service !the restaurants are mostly good - the one to avoid is the ' english pub ' - ok for a drink but dreadful food .we especially liked the baccarrat restaurant which does lovely breakfasts .we do n't mind waiting and having a few drinks , but some people were getting really annoyed about it .i must mention jaquan ( crepe maker ) who was so friendly , and sandra ( concierge staff ) who allowed us to keep our room after checkout ( 11 a.m. ) until our pick up time for our flight ( 8 p.m. ) ."
95,"we should have known better than to believe the mediocre reviews because it was a great experience and met the service and quality standards we expect from sandals resorts !we were met by a group of disinterested individuals who took our luggage from us and told us to get in the allocated transport bus .the seats were covered in plastic , temperature was in the 30 's and humid and we were all jammed in and told to wait .eventually after some one had identified she was in the wrong bus for the wrong resortwhen we arrived at the resort we all got out and one young couple went to retireve their cases and </DOC> staffs were probably the friendliest of any resort i have been to .many thanks to ram who served us brilliantly and was so friendly to us .sandals gives you all that , plus free snorkeling , sailing , and ... best of all ... diving !room service - excellent .this was our second trip to this resort and let me say at the start the staff could not be more accommodating , friendly and charming . </DOC> the private island is very nice .service is excellent .also there re two pools , and the atmosphere was very boringand he said management said they ca n't because the older people will complain and they get in trouble .they were all super nice , professional , attentive and with big smiles ! </DOC> let me preface this by saying we had a great vacation , but this was in spit of many of the sandals concierge personnel .we found most to be uncaring and some downright rude .for the most part the restaurants were good , but as the years go by ( this is our 8th sandals ) , the quality seems to be deteriorating .there just does n't seem to be the customer first atmosphere .in particular , the service was somewhat uneven . </DOC> you do n't feel special in the bahamas , or at least we did nt feel waited on and special at sandals .they do a good job of creating little romantic spaces through out .butler service : this was our first experience with butler service .the service was good , but we are not used to being waited on and it was rather awkward .the benefit of butler service for us was having our chairs reserved by the pool in the morning . </DOC> the service was excellent , the food was quite good , and the room product was also excellent .then to add insult to injuryseems innocent enough right ?yes they have blasting loud speakers which vibrate throughout the property and which we heard every night with our doors shut and ear plugs on ., we splurged on butler service . </DOC> that was no big deal ; the towncar was nice and we were told that we would be taken back to the airport in the rolls royce which did happen .we were then taken to the reception room to await our butler , delino .once he arrived , he gave us a brief tour of the resort while escorting us to our room .the downside is the rooms and staff on reception .we were really really dissappointed with our room . </DOC> we complained to reception who said if we were not happy with the room we had we could have a smaller room !we enquired in the evening and a snooty japanise woman on reception offered us another room even worse than the first ( or second or third ! ) .i had finalized the booking about 5 months earlier , but upon arrival at the airport , the sandals desk staff had no record of our expected arrival .something i had mentioned to one of the desk staff at the airport in passing .upon arrival we were met with cold towels and champagne which was nice ."
96,"we were then subjected to a torturous logging in proceed by a cheery young ladyit was the longest check in i ' ve ever had .there were no robes when we arrivedphone calls for them to appear .the fridge / coffee / body lotion was n't stocked up on a daily basis . </DOC> the service and food on our first night at crystal was superb , second night at casanova poor .but the staff was happy to flip them over and bring towels to help us .at the bar they do n't have red stripe .even though the staff was aware that it was our anniversary , they never acknowledged it .other resorts we have stayed at have sent us greetings , a fruit plate , a bottle of wine or some other form of congratulations , sandals did nothing ! </DOC> they tried to switch our accomodations when we checked ini requested to speak with the facilities manager but got no response from him .the housekeeping was fine although a few times they tried to do turn down service after 10 pm , which was very annoying .the staff is friendly enough and the service is acceptable .truly great customer service . </DOC> good restaurants and staff are happy to help you any way they can .the lunch was very good and our first taste of the local beer was enjoyed .this was just a outdoor cafe and the service and food was good .so i went down to the conceirge desk and told them if they thought it was gon na be a problem we would like to be moved .the food and service was the usual sandals super , you can eat as much as you want . </DOC> some employees were extremely helpful and efficient , but others just seemed disinterested .it seemed that the most pleasant and helpful employees ( and there were many ) were from jamaica rather than local to nassau .staff was very friendly .so courteous and helpful .bartenders were friendly . </DOC> the food was excellent overall .however , i can not give the hotel a five star rating as the service was not always of the standard i expect .restaurants were generally good ( not great ) but the resort needs a coffee bar or ice cream parlour as they have in other sandals resorts .we hung out at the bar and watched the entertainment staff keep the guests having a good time . </DOC> your thing/ only name was appleton ‚Äôsjust a different kind of vibe-we waited and waited for a server to take our order - finally they did .i have to note staff was n‚Äôt as lively and upbeat as at previous sandals ...they came back twice luke warm at best . </DOC> we were moved to the windsor building in a handicapped room .chairs around the pool are plentiful , but not the "" good ones "" .i do n‚Äôt think the definition of elegance is a canoe in the pool with 8 people in it .they really should give people a proper indication of what they are paying for .breakfast was great , huge amount of choice and"
97,"we gave up and tried to go to sleep .breakfast was ok , service not friendly nor helpful .we tried to complain again , but were told no manager available .after returning homeservice was really pleasant and efficient . </DOC> the service was always efficient and friendly , all the staff were very charming .but meals were going to be cooked on a chargrill !so we cancelled both rooms and went to another hotel where the service was fantastic .reading reviews on thisi ' m not sure we would have had a great experience especially when part of the menu was n't going to be served . </DOC> like other comments the service lacked something to draw you to the place despite the issues .on the plus side they did call to tell us which was good andbut it 's the way there was no offer of something simple like reduction in room rate or bottle of wine .we used the crab regularly as i have relatives locally and its been greatbut we wo n't go back or recommend it under the new management we much prefer great service . </DOC> the service charge they added was an insult in the circumstances and we removed it .they did this with no fuss and were very accommodating .the food on the set menu was very goodthe service was slow .we would return </DOC> in addition to being my birthday , this was one of the special moments during our europe vacation .i am fairly certain that we were served by the owner , who went out of his way to be attentive and fun .interact with other customers and he was just fantastic . </DOC> an excellent restaurant , with brilliant rooms - some with their own hot tubs .staff were attentive and very helpful with dietary issues .nice pastries and breads .they explained it was a limited menu as it was the kitchens first night , despite this there was something for all except vegetarians , luckily that was not me .great menu , great food , children well catered for , and friendly service . </DOC> the service was first class and the atmosphere and ambiance was pleasant .supper was lovely and thoroughly enjoyable .although we did get milk delivered outside our door in the morning but only found it when we went down to breakfast ! would have been nice to have been told about this .a bottle of bubbly later and fully relaxedwe took up our 7.15 booking in the restaurant which , in the run up to xmas , was pretty busy . </DOC> deciding to try to relax we were treated to our neighbours playing very loud music .we asked them to turn it off - they ignored us .i asked management to intervene - unfortunately there was no one ' in charge ' so our long suffering waiter managed to get the neighbours to turn off the music .in the meantime , we had a drink in the bar .by the time we returned to our room , the music was still thumping away ."
98,"the food was ok but nothing special and the service was adequate .i know the place has not been open for longbut i think they can do better .will try again in a couple of months time .the food is the best . </DOC> the restaurant was bizarre .we ate early and were seated next to the only other couple in there .even the waiter commented on this .the food was bland and lacked any real flavour .service was erratic and just weird in places . </DOC> my husband booked the stay as a surprise for my birthday .and then the surprise would be ruined .they were very reassuring that everything would be fine and they would not let the cat out of the bag !well , you know what is coming , they did !we had hoped for a reply and an apology . </DOC> the service was fine with nice staff .but at least one highlight should be mentioned : the restaurant .we got a really good quality of food ( fish restaurant ) .the founding management team with the rebranded crab and boar have moved on .the new managers seem to be focused . </DOC> and we also encountered a few .the other half 's tea came without sugar which was requested by the receptionist but never came .that said check in was quick and friendly .the staff were excellent , very professional and very attentive .the tables were well spread out and although a couple of the tables had a noisy member , dining atmosphere was quite pleasant . </DOC> food was steady , nothing special .good thing the new owners have deep pocketsthe staff were all very welcoming and friendly .great service , delicious food .we were very impressed on our first visit and made a promise to ourselves that we would return . </DOC> the staff were trying their best but probably want a little more training especially in the bar area .i do n‚Äôt mind jeans on waiting staff but felt a few where to casually dressed & certainly do n‚Äôt wine to see bright red base ball boots or other tatty canvas shoes - a good dress code for staff states lack of detail to me from management- not sure where this is now aiming for but feels like it ‚Äôs lostour dinner was excellent , the room comfortable , the en - suite had a bath and fine toiletries .all the staff were engagingly attentive and importantly a good breakfast . </DOC> the food was mixed , some of us who had fish were very pleased , cooked perfectly and quality was good .the deserts were pleasant but not memorable .apart from the stilton the rest of the cheeses were young and flavourless .i was looking forward to trying the crab and boar having been a regular customer at the crab for some years .we ordered 2 glasses of sparkling wine which did not arrive until we were half way through our starters !"
99,"they were very quiet for sunday lunch which surprised me as this is a very popular family occasion now .whilst the food was good when it arrived , the service was very very slow and we had to wait about 45mins between our starters and main course , which when you have a child with you seems a very long time .the staff were nice , but no one came and updated on why it was taking so long andoverall the atmosphere is very good , the food was tasty but the service time needs to be addressed .when walking around the room , someone has their priorities wrong ........ </DOC> it came with four 10p sized risotto balls , very dissapointing .we spoke to the manager who said he would relay our comments back to chef .breakfast was just ok , nothing to shout home about .service is very slow , but on constantly reminding the staff we were in a hurry ( first course took 25 mins to appear ) the most pleasant portugese maitre'd took charge and our main course came pretty quckly .the breakfast was okay , nothing special but nothing wrong either . </DOC> service generally good and friendly .shame really , as the service was very good , and the menu read very well .we had dinner there in a party of seven , and all agreed with what i ' m saying here .we had the gleneagles room , which was attacked by two flights of steps up which the receptionist very kindly let me carry my own suitcase!!!.and i ordered the scallops with risotto ..... </DOC> patio doors not working too well out onto the patio and hot tub area .the restaurant staff were very attentive , without overdoing it , and the hotel manager was a comedian in disguise .... did a good job making us and our next table visitors smile ...the crab at chievely we booked a two night break and were made to feel really special .every member of staff we met were polite and friendly .our evening meal was delicious , beautifully presented with immaculate service . </DOC> we found the waiting staff efficient but not too obtrusive , just as it should be .we found this rude and inconsiderate and so did the member of staff we reported them to .food was good though , very good staff , great steak but at over ¬£ 300 for db&b , with not to dear a bottle of wine , a few ( awful , flat beers ) way , way too expensive for what 's on offerthe food at both breakfast and dinner was excellent ‚Äì and we did realise that the room was likely to be eccentric .service at dinner was a bit slow on friday when the restaurant was full . </DOC> so you are promised a good relaxing night sleep .our family came here for a meal , there was 8 of us , the staff were very friendly and tried to be helpful but got a little distracted when other guests came in .as for the food some of our starters were nice and the ones who had squid , this was over cooked and very chewy .our mains were ok nothing special butnice , sorry to say </DOC> we wonder why a hotel and restaurant of this quality thinks that it needs piped music , to compete with kitchen doors , bar serving , the noise of feet on hard floors , and the guests ' conversation .the food was excellent - i had the white fish soup , followed by crab & lobster gratin whilst my wife opted for smoked salmon .all were well presented andoverall service was very good too .the food was amazing , the wine was lovely ... and the service was brilliant ( not experienced that in a while ! ! ) from the a la carte menu i had scallops ( yum ) , and parmesan crusted turbot ... </DOC> bar staff goodour room was tired , but clean and unusual decor with nespresso machine , cookies and a few nice personal touches .breakfast slightly chaotic the following morning , but again a lovely selection on the menu to choose from .the evening meal was to die for and everyone 's meal was oustanding - if a little overpriced ( ¬£ 8 for a bowl of veg ) .staff throughout were friendly and always cheerful - we had a great stay ."
