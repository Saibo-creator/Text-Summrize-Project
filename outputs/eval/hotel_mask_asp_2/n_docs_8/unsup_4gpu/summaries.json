    "docs": "unacceptable for a five star hotel .this was not a last minute reservation .amenities are what you 'd expect at this level , as was the breakfast which offered a wide variety of high - quality food as well as attentive waiters .i have stayed at this hotel 5 or 6 times over the past 8 years or so and i felt that the hotel was not as good as it used to be .the gym is rather small but does have a small indoor pool , in the basement . </DOC> let 's start with the negative - hotel looks slightly dated ; but that 's itwifi is also expensive , but most hotels suffer from the same problem .however what i did see wa superlative , in fact i would rate this as one of the best hotels i have ever seen or stayed in .no decent complimentary english morning paper .my main issue at staying here was that in - room wifi is not free and costs € 15 a night . </DOC> guys it was one of the best stays in my life .restaurant situation here was minimal and very overpriced .breakfast buffet was horribly overpriced ( 32euros ) .wifi was very expensive - why ? ? ? ?when so many top tier hotels include it in the rate . </DOC> note : pictures are better than the room .in room wifi is extremely expensive and the lobby based free wifi is insanely slow .free wifi is a recommendation to the management , its 2015 , wifi really is n't considered to be a premium service anymorethe breakfast was very good , but at 29.50 euros was exorbitant .wifi was also exorbitant , and despite a hefty room charge they also charged 8 euros for a three cabin ( women 's , mixed dry , somewhat cooler saunarium with colored lights ) sauna . </DOC> they agreed to this but charged an extra 20 euros a night ( not impressed )not really the service i would expect from this star or type of hotel . have stayed at a westin in hawaii which was amazing , did feel bit disappointed with this one .pricey , so is the bar .the pool and gym are ok .otherwise i would have booked somewhere else as aside from the $ 200 room rate the cost of staying on the hotel was not worth it . </DOC> breakfast is a buffet banquet .we did not use the restaurant , but the breakfast buffet is exceptionally good ( and although priced expensively and additionally to the room rate we were offered it at half price as we were staying for more than 3 days ) .we stayed in this lovely property twice on a 2 1/2 month journey around europe .guess though that some work needs to be carried out , specially for the carpets and the bathroom which tub has still a mechanic arm for the shower , unacceptable nowadays at this hotel level .prices perhaps too high taking into accounts these deficiencies . </DOC> it is above average , but i would n't say that it was \" very good \" .not good at all is that the hotel is not having an own parking , the public parking is only 300 metres away but there is no reserved parking lots for the hotel guests .good quality food delivered within time promised every time .beware ! outrageously expensive for phone and internet !next time though we will treat ourselves to an upgrade . </DOC> you would definitely not need to book with breakfast or half board as the hotel is surrounded with my dining and eating options .something very important for people like me who spend a lot of time in hotels for business purposes , simply because you can have a good night sleep .the westin berlin is better than most westin properties in terms of service and cleanliness .breakfast was great .the pillows are a little too soft for my liking .",

    "docs": "breakfast was a little pricey but well worth it - what a wide variety of tasty options .just spent five nights at the hilton and it was better than many previous visits .the hilton was really the first true international / global brand 5star in adelaide and consequently has been hammered by those who subscribe to \" tall poppy syndrome \" .ca n't really fault my unintended stay here - airline put me ( and others ) up due to a cancelled flight , so ca n't comment on value as i ' ve no idea what it would normally cost .whilst it was not the best part of our trip ( due to my illnes ) the hilton made it as comfortable as possible . </DOC> i have no doubt that the check in clerk did this deliberately , trying to fob me off with a poor smelly room , despite the fact that i booked an executive room and paid about $ 50 extra .after some argument , i was reluctantly given a non smoking room , which was quite ordinary .overall , i once again left the hotel satisfied , although perhaps a bit less so compared to the prior visit .our room was no great shakes , but sleep quality was good with no noise any of the nights .room service not too expensive but food very mediocre . </DOC> what a farce .breakfast is good with all the usual quality buffet offerings and treats .the breakfast choice was excellent but it was served luke warm .when will adelaide get a decent hotel ?no powerpoints working and four lights not working . </DOC> they gave us a room and also complimentary access to executive lounge which was fabulous .the previous stays had also been to mark special occasions and both times it was acknowledged so this was a little disappointing .and just that feeling which was difficult to pinpoint that cost cuttings were happening .as usual the club provided a good array of food .breakfast buffet is good and served on the ground floor . </DOC> i hope this review was helpful .my last stay here was n't the best , but this last stay saw thjings back to how they used to be .to some extent , a hilton is a hilton , but this one is better than average .the hotel was renovating the lobby restaurant but the makeshift one was fine .having to pay an extra $ 5 for a latte was not good . </DOC> i booked my room through wotif and got a very reasonable rate .having to share public places like lifts with people who just ca n't spend a night away from their pet is outrageous .natural lighting from the small window , was , however , inadequate and made the room quite dark .i did not use the hotel restaurant , but had a good quality coffee with fast , friendly service in the cafe area .the hotel is generally good , food is excellent and the service is pretty good . </DOC> the fact that a customer has to prove something like that is unacceptable , they should manage these things better .a joke - crowne plaza has much better brekky buffet ( gourmet sausages , fresh juice , pan cake machine etc ) .what made this stay special was the quality of the service - just spot on .good - but a little dated and certainly not equivalent to 5 star in other cities - in particular tv was too small ( it was a rugby world cup weekend ) .other than that , expect typical hilton quality through - out . </DOC> the hotel is engaged in some refurbishment and the construction noise during daylight hours was intrusive to bordering on intolerable .on subsequent days no one came despite my earlier stated desire that the room be attended to .however , there are better hotels at lower prices which are better located in adelaide .having said that , the location , restaurant and service in this hotel are mighty fine - and sometimes wow is no substitute for good old fashioned comfort .we had booked three nights and the deal came with a bottle of sparkling .",

    "docs": "so here are a few negatives about this luxury resortso here are a few minor negatives : we have been to other resorts on the mayan riviera that were not \" luxury \" but were as good or better than akumal .take mexican pesos to pay your hotel bill , even if it 's only for the safe and the mexican show , if you pay in dollars the rate is not good .food is good , with enough choices to meet all tastes .however , a small price to pay for a wonderful resort - one of our best vacations ever ! enjoy ! </DOC> flights were good even though we had hoped to be flying on a 787 dreamliner , service now starts in august .also the mexican restaurant was also very good .to start i must say that we had a thoroughly enjoyable holiday .we paid $ 728 + taxes with airtransat vacations for the club golden that provided an extra a la carte meal , free internet , closer to the beach ... only $ 50 more so worth it to us .the occupancy rate was low so they were not accepting any guests on the tulum side for a few days while they continued to make repairs caused by hurricane wilma . </DOC> first day was quite disappointing and knowing that the folks at the front desk just could n't give a* * * * was quite infuriating ( especially since i had an email verifying that my request would be granted ) ...not even water was provided .an older woman , alone , is treated poorly at this property .room in villa 50 was good and well equipped with coffee maker and ironing board . </DOC> just returned from the grand bahia after two wonderful weeks .the best meal of the week .your restaurants by email to save any disappointment .2 ask for a mattress topper for additional comfort .the noise level was fine , nothing to complain about . </DOC> room service is also included .but it is certainly not a five star resort ., i do n't know how much this costs or what the standard rooms are like but do not pay for the upgrade .i was really disappointed with the room , it was dated and scruffy .this suited us fine because we like the exercise , but i can see it being a challenge for people who are not in good shape , so staying lower down would be a good option . </DOC> ’s are cheap and safe to use , all be itso a disabled guest could not use a toilet near the main buffet or reception area for that time unless they wished to perch on the edge of a toilet without a seat .we did't argue -i wo nt go on at great lengths about the resort because my comments would reflect many of the very positive comments already left by previous posters .we had such a good time at this resort that i can only imagine that those posters that have poorly rated the resort must have had a bad personal experience which has influenced their view . </DOC> we travelled to bahia principe with very low price ( 1100 € for 2 persons in august 2010 ) so we can´t really complain .depending on the price my advice is :a really good size room , huge comfortable bed , immaculately clean , complimentary toiletries , coffee maker and a well stocked mini bar .al cartes are still as good .. japanese , fish or gourmet were all very good and high recommended .i ' ve ever had ruining the evening ( see below ) . </DOC> however there are some points worth noting .the food in the buffet was ok , i found it to be very repetitive and never hot , it was usually warm or coldthey did say they only had double beds available and would that be ok .they are not double rooms just large twins and although a hotel does of course need a good supply of these it should have a lot more double / king roomsblocks 82 and 83 are worth the extra money .",

    "docs": "we had a nice stay at the riu guanacaste .good range of drinks including cocktails and some premium brands -maybe because it 's a tad more expensive , it 's lacking the us / canadian ' ' ere we go ' equivalents who start drinking at 10 am just because it 's all inclusive !the restaurants had good food but do n't expect gourmet food .and it was sufficient for us . </DOC> having read the reviews i am always surprised to hear people complain about things that they should know before they go .that said , riu guanacaste operates as a fine tuned machine , as far as all - inclusives go .casino is ok , seemed the machines were a little tighter than normal , but could ' ve just been my luck .however , as part of an all inclusive package , including a direct flight on the dreamliner from the uk , it is very good value indeed .the food was good considering the size of the resort , with ample choice , and lots cooked fresh . </DOC> i missed this the first few days , but they serve some excellent coffee drinks outside the buffet .good quality drinks , especially frozen cocktails !night entertainment was typical all - inclusive .but it ’s still part of overall ‘ vacation experience ’ .it ’s a glorified picnic pavilion – a roof with no walls , held up by wooden poles and no air - conditioning or working fans . </DOC> in addition to that as we loaded the plane it was held extra 20 minutes also with no air - conditioning at the only gate they have because of computer problems .and that ’s not always .and that means you only have chairs and a volleyball , no activities , no parties , no food .there were even strollers on the late booze cruise with crying babies , ugh .the steak house is reservation only and throughout our 3 night stay we were unable to secure a reservation for our group . </DOC> so we ate at the chinese restauarant each night where the meals were pretty good ( with the exception of the dessert ) .i thought the buffet was really good .insect repellant is sensible but we were surprised to find that ' mossies ' were not a big problem in general .however , this place is only for those who either can not afford better , do n’t know better , enjoy a rowdy spring break environment or are just into gluttony with big mounds of buffet food and mediocre booze .the food was good , it had everything you could want for breakfast , lunch and dinner . </DOC> the main buffet restaurant has a lot of variety and changes night to night .as others have shared , besides bar soap , the only other toiletry provided is shampoo in a dispenser in the shower .if you have mobility issues this is not an ideal hotel for you as it is large .international alcohol is free - but you need to ask ) - always taken into account that this is a large all inclusive complex ( which is of course a limitation ) .the food was good , pool are large with volleyball and swim up bar . </DOC> but for the price you pay for this resort , it should offer more .it 's not bland , but it just does n't taste good .but it had some major drawbacks .secondly , there is no light in the shower and it is walled off ( sounds like i am making a fuss out of nothing much ,good beer and softs including some diet . </DOC> the resort is a very typical all inclusive very much up to riu standards ( not riu palace ) .there are no other hotels around , although this one is about to more than double in size .do n't expect the best italian food because you are in costa rica not italy .this hotel is fairly poor with little that stands out .but it seems pretty far from that .",
