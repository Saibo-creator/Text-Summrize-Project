        "docs": "This is an Ibis Hotel that is more like a Motel.Very clean very welcoming but you will need a car or bike. Excellent for the Cotswolds. Rooms can be as cheap as \u00a330.There is a bar on site,the hotel used to belong to a health club hence the non standard Ibis layout. </DOC> Hotel are according IBIS Red Standard no more not less. I feel like in the rest of them well but if you are looking not practical hotel, this is not a hotel but for people like myself that only a hotel clean, and not so many not added value services this is a great job quite near Jaguar technology center. </DOC> We spent two nights there to attend a wedding. Our arrival was late on the first night so we ate in. The food was basic, out a packet with a fresh salad, but at least it was a good packet. The room was small, clean with a good bed and fairly modern bathroom. The grounds!! A mess get them swept at least once a week. Breakfast was very basic \u2013 egg, bacon, sausage (a good sausage) and the normal cereal and toast etc. Ok not great, but as a previous reviewer said \u2018you get what you pay for\u2019 and it was very cheap </DOC> Stayed ebcause it was cheap - just 40 pounds and expecting the usual Ibis kit-out. Very hard to find, but the staff was very helpful giving direction. The place looks like some clapped-out US motel, certainly not what once would expect from an Ibis (identikit medium rise bright newlybuilt) but the interior has mostly been furnished with the usual familiar looking Ibis furniture. Not a bad place, fairly quiet but could do with an update - especially bathroom. Staying there more than one night, and with nowhere to eat in the vicinity, it can get quite depressing. </DOC> The hotel it is a bit old and need to be renovated but the bed was very comfortable,new television and kettle for tea and coffee. Staff and management are very nice and helpful nothing to complain.During the week they do even special menu from 18 to 21,breakfast was nice and not too expensive. They could improve a bit the building in general,it gets ruin. I definitely recommend the hotel for the price!!Of course you cannot expect a luxury hotel but good for a night or business. </DOC> I visit the Midlands every couple of weeks for my job and stay overnight. I had not stayed in the same hotel twice until now. The staff are friendly and helpful. The rooms are quiet (although on this visit people were clomping around on the overhead balcony). Nice room (I stayed in 12 this time), although one of the lights in the bathroom was not working and the cleaning could have been better), but overall a good place to do a bit of work and then relax. Beds were really comfortable and I got a great nights sleep. Breakfast was basic but very tasty. I said I would be back and I was - and will be happy to return again. Thanks Ibis - getting it right again. </DOC> we needed to be in Coventry on and off over a period of time, so six nights were spent here over a period of three weeks, service, check in, check out was all impecable, rooms were basic but clean, better than travelodge, you get what you pay for however breakfast was poor and expensive, we negotiated free breakfasts for two nights, if you do not ask, you do not get!! </DOC> If you are looking for a cheap, dated, damp hotel comparable to a 1970's holiday camp then welcome to the Ibis south Coventry.
