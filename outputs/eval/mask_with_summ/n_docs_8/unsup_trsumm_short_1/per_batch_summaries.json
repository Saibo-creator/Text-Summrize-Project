)the manager / owner and staff were excellent .very efficient , friendly and helpful .breakfast was good .it is a short walk into townbut when we said that we wished they had a restaurant for evening meals , ( to save the walk ) , they said they could accommodate that .we had an excellent meal in the hotel at a lower cost than eating in town - they should advertise that more !definitely recommend staying here if you visit easter island </DOC> from the moment we were met at the airport and given leis to when we left and were each given necklaces with a moai on iti was impressed with this hotel .all of the grounds are well kept with beautiful flowering bushes .the rooms were nice and clean .after a week and a half in south america i finally got a really good omelet .the hotel is convenient not only to the airport but also not far from town although the walk into town involves a steep downgrade which means a steep upgrade coming back .the manager of the hotel was extremely helpful .he gave us some excellent recommendations for dinner .i would definitely recommend this hotel . </DOC> when we corresponded with the hotel they let us know that we could walk to the hotel easily from the airport even with luggage .we did the same on the way back .we also walked into the town easily from the hotel daily to eat .the manager jarkko is very knowledgable about the island and gave us good insider advice during our stay .the hotel is peaceful and there is a pool and terrace for post sightseeing relaxation .the rooms are large , we had two double beds , efficient aircon , with a seating area and patio doors onto the terrace .we had breakfast every day in the large dining area and really enjoyed the extensive buffet menu including fresh fruit , local specialities and made to order eggs </DOC> i did a lot of readings about the hotels on the island and decided to stay at hotel puku vai because of its comfort and value , nice friendly staffs and its airport / town location .the living area is well furnished and has a flat screen tv and stocked refrigerator .it has a sliding glass door to the garden and pool ( inside courtyard ) .the split ac unit is cool and quiet .laundry service is available for a very reasonable price .value : good deal when i bundled room and tour in one price .they use kia koe touri did mine for 5 days and have time to explore the town and museum . </DOC> the staff at the hotel puku vai are extremely customer oriented .they create an amazing experience for guests and attend to all of your needs .the breakfast is great with many options such as omelettes , breads , cereals , cheeses , cakes and juices .the pool temperature is great for swimming and the rooms are well appointed and spacious .the hotel is a 15 minute walk into town and five minutes from the airport .you definitely need to stay here when visiting easter island </DOC> this is a good hotel , spotlessly clean albeithowever , this strangely enough kinda fits with the whole easter island experience- makes you feel as though you really are in a remote tropical island .important thing is that the rooms are huge , clean and beds are comfortable .all rooms have double doors that open out to the pool area .breakfast is continental style , nothing to shout about but perfectly adequate .literally 5 minutes walk from the airport .pros : great staff , very friendly and helpful cons : bring right next to the airport, the hotel is a full 30 minute walk to \" downtown \" and decent food options .can call a taxi or walk it , so it 's a con if you do n't like walking . </DOC> we had just spent a week in antarctica , and this side trip to easter island was the end of our two weeks .the transfer service was there to meet us -but honestly if you did not have much luggage you could walk from the airport to the hotel .the management staff greeted us and the other couple who arrived on the same flight .the rooms have an in - room safe , minibar fridge , tv , table , chairs and outside chairs .the bathroom is quite large with a shower over the bath .basic and functional . loved the pool area .as other have noticed all 14 rooms have a sliding glass door to the pool areaand we kept ours open day and night - felt safe .",
