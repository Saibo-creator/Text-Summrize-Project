        "docs": "We had a one night stay at the Roxbro House with a deal bought via Groupon. We thought we may not get as good a service due to the price paid, however although our room (3) was a little small for two adults and a dog, it was perfectly formed with lots of lovely touches. The whole house is beautifully furnished to a high standard and the host was very helpful and welcoming. I would thoroughly recommend this lovely B & B - we will be back! </DOC> We stayed in Room 2 which was lovely - good decor and clean. There is a guest lounge downstairs with an honesty bar and some lovely treats, brownies and millionaire shortbread when we were there. There are some nice touches in the rooms too - apples, shortbread and chocs as well as dressing gowns and slippers. There is a good breakfast choice with everything freshly cooked. Warkworth itself is a lovely little village (definetly take a look at The Greenhouse, a great little shop!) and the B&B looks right onto the castle ruins. </DOC> We went for a few nights on the recommendation of a friend and had a lovely time. A warm friendly welcome, lovely room with a view of the castle, large bathroom and yummy biscuits and chocolates. For Happy Hour ( complimentary on the sideboard and not to be confused with the honesty bar ) the wine was good quality and the cheese delicious. Breakfast was awesome with nothing too much trouble, even getting some beans which were not on the menu. When I got back home I read the reviews which I had not done before visiting and can only say the two bad reviews must have been from 'professional moaners' - I can say mine is an honest review and my review profile is worldwide !! Well done Claire and Stu on a 5star B & B we hope to return </DOC> We have returned from 3 nights in this fab B&B. We had the room overlooking the castle and it was wonderful. We enjoyed the Cheese and Wine hour (complimentary) and my husband loved having a piece of cake when we returned from our adventures! We managed breakfast only on one occasion as we were so cosy in our massive bed! Breakfast was cooked fresh and the choice was impressive. Parking was fine - you park right outside! We shall return and try a different room! </DOC> Booked last minute for a Saturday night stay and very glad we did. Lovely warm welcome, great position opposite Warkworth Castle and easy access to the village. Nice old house that is spotless and loved. One of the best breakfasts we've had in B&B's and fancy hotels! Think Roxbro House will be seeing us again . </DOC> I can only agree with previous reviews on this site. Lovely B & B. Warm friendly welcome from Claire and her husband. Excellent breakfast. The honesty bar is a nice touch. I would recommend the walk from Craster to the Ship Inn at Low Newton. </DOC> Roxbury house is an excellent place to stay. We had a suite which was very comfortable. The bedroom was large and bright and the large separate bathroom had an attractive bath in the centre of the room and a separate shower. The choice for breakfast was very good. I felt that it was a bit over priced but I would still go back if I was in the area. </DOC> I booked this as a surprise for my partners birthday and I am so glad I did - I couldn't have made a more perfect choice. Every little detail is included to make sure you have a fabulous stay. I booked the Ethel Nobel Suite and it was just luxury. Lovely big comfy bed, fabulous view of the medieval castle, huge slipper bath and all the other little details that the room included from candles to chocolates. The owners couldn't do enough for us but were not intrusive in any way. The breakfast was to die for - I could happily eat the Roxbro Rosti every day and served with a smile and friendly conversation. I honestly could not find anything bad to say about this place and it is a little pricy but worth every penny!",
