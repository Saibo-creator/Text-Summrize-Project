        "docs": "Check is process was quite inefficient. Five people were trying to check in 2-3 families and it was very, very slow. Rooms are very basic, but have everything you need. AC was quite ancient and did not work. But this place right in the National Park and has good General Store with everything you need including great beer selection. No WiFi and very poor cellular reception, but again you are right there. </DOC> The lodge is in the park and there are shuttle buses ( free) that take you to the canyon rim very regularly. The rooms were far from luxurious but they were clean and the bed was comfortable. The decor was very dark and made the place look much worse that it actually is. We had an included breakfast as part of our tour ( a tour of the Canyonlands) the breakfast area is like a canteen but the food was adequate and plentiful. The lighting and signage at nigh t were not good. We had our evening meal on the canyon rim and caught the shuttle bus back in the dark. It was difficult to find our room! </DOC> The Yavapai Lodge is a perfectly good alternative to the other, more sought-after lodges at the South Rim. The rooms are large, clean and (wait for it...) air-conditioned. With summer temperatures in the 90's, that makes a HUGE difference. Breakfast in the dining room is good and the staff are very knowledgeable and pleasant. </DOC> Yuvapai lodge has many venues spread out over 1/4 to 1/2 mile from the reservation center. It is in the perfect place to see the Grand Canyon. It is about 1 mile from the Grand Canyon Visitor Center, and is the closest hotel/motel to Mather Point. Staff are fabulous. The downside is that there is no Wifi service in the rooms, but who cares? You are there to experience the Grand Canyon. Also, they have free cable, so you can catch up on the news. We purchased a free breakfast, which is $16 and is worth the expense. However, they have other limited options. Highly recommend. </DOC> We wanted to stay in the park to be able to see sunset and sunrise over the canyon. It served the purpose. We were actually quite pleasantly surprised at the facility. It was quite cosy and clean. Quite expensive but then if you wanted to stay in the park, there's no many choices. There was no wifi in the room. The hotel lobby has limited wifi but we knew about this before hand so weren't surprised. </DOC> So many people want to stay in the national park, quality service doesn't have to be offered. This was more like indoor camping. Grey, stained towels. Worn furnishings. Tight spaces. Poor lighting. Dirty carpets. It did have good beds and blanket options. Good desk workarea. </DOC> Its very convenient for the shuttle buses and views of the canyon. Rooms are a tad basic but (in May) absolutely fine despite having no aircon but openable screened windows. The site is large and we were quite a way from the main buildings where there was food etc. We actually bought ourselves a picnic at the general store in the evening which made a nice change from yet another restaurant meal. I;'m pretty sure the wifi worked OK here. </DOC> I get it, you are there for the canyon not a five star hotel experience but ... While it's justifiably expensive because of the location there are lots of little things that are just not up to scratch with the room and services, stuff that is easy to solve too. It all adds up and means that the majesty of the Grand Canyon experience is tainted by the feeling that you are being ripped off. I think there needs to be more oversight and accountability of franchisees by the NPS.",

        "docs": "Don't stay here if you're expecting a five star royal stay; this is simple a good, basic motel with clean rooms, and very convenient location. Our room was in a quiet building, close to the main visitor center so rather than hassle with parking, it was far easier to just walk less than half a mile to the visitor center. Main blue bus line runs right by the motel so you can easily catch the bus to anywhere you'd want to see. Dining hall in the main lodge building was good for breakfast and dinner, pricey but pretty much on par with other dining options. Wifi is only in the main lodge so that was inconvenient but the cable tv worked fine. No air conditioning but when we came you'd never need AC. Heat and ceiling fan worked fine. Beds were comfy and shower was clean with good water pressure. </DOC> Had a second floor east wing room. 2 double beds. Recently redone so clean and comfy. Not the ritz but pretty good for a National Park room. Close to the rim and the General Store and Lodge. Has a coffee shop and restaurant. No Wi-Fi in rooms although there is in the lodge </DOC> We have stayed at the Grand Canyon in years past at Mastic Lodge which was closer to the rim (short walk) but did not find the rooms that nice. We stayed here this trip in the 2 story newer rooms with AC and found the rooms quite nice. It is a short walk to the Village area and main Lodge (restaurant/lounge/tavern) which is the only location you can get WiFi. Room was clean and a good size. The newer section has 6 2-story buildings. The Village has a large grocery store, a Deli, and gift shop. It is a bit of a walk to the rim but the shuttle bus stops here (blue line). </DOC> Stayed in Yavapai East. Lodges 1-2 closest to shuttle stops. Across the street from marketplace. Good hot shower, good water pressure, comfortable beds. Super convenient to stay inside the park instead of Tusuyan. We walked to Yavapai point, a bit of a tramp through the woods, but doable. </DOC> This cabin complex is in a beautiful location but our cabin, though adequate for our one night stay, was in need of a few minor repairs such as doors not closing properly. Air conditioning is provided by means of a ceiling fan. This was not a problem since nights are still cool at this altitude during the latter part of May. </DOC> Were checked in by receptionist leaning against the wall ( left side of desk ) and treating me like he prefered I had stayed away... Room was in a sort of army barrack looking building. All parking spaces were already occupied, no elevator so dragg your luggage up the stairs. Room stuffed with oversized dull furniture, loose carpet, smelling dusty and badly, first thing we did was opening the window. Just put our luggage in room and went for dinner. Bed was ok but next morning....HORROR HORROR found traces of poo on bathroom floor, had not noticed previous evening because we were so in a hurry. Decided to leave \u00ab hotel \u00bb, it\u2019s not worth to be called a hotel, it\u2019s a dusty, smelly, dirty old dump, immediately. </DOC> We stayed in Yavapai west which is basically a motel. It was snowing when we arrived and thankfully the heater worked. The room was basic and clean, and included a refrigerator and a coffee maker. The beds were comfortable enough. Plenty of clean towels. Friendly staff. It was noisy in the morning with people either packing up to leave or go out, but one does not go to the Grand Canyon to sit around in the room or sleep late. Since it is in a National Park it is pretty much a government run hotel. It was ok and provided basics. </DOC> This is an older lodge but it has been recently very nicely updated. We heard a lot of noise from up above, so I would suggest you request a 2nd floor room if that could be an issue for you. We found the room to be comfortable, and we enjoyed the location, because it was easy to catch a shuttle from there, and it was a very short drive to the best locations for watching the sunset and sunrise - which a lot of people do. We enjoyed our short stay at the Yavapai Lodge!",

        "docs": "1st time staying in Grand Canyon. Surrounded by trees. We stayed in West units that are one story with ceiling fans, no air. Eastern units cost more,have air, two stories.Parking lot for East units not near the rooms. We parked right in front of our unit. We opened windows and ceiling fan was fine. No fancy decor but location is best point.We were right behind main lodge building that has cafeteria and bar. Walked there.You felt like you are in the mountains.Close to shuttle stop too and general store. </DOC> We stayed here for 2 nights in the East area in a ground floor room. First the positives - the bathroom was clean and the heating and air con worked well. We didn\u2019t try breakfast in the lodge because since we were last here a Starbucks has opened in Tusayan, only 10 minutes drive away. The negatives - having read a review here which talked about bedbugs I was determined to check the bed when we arrived. Although there was no sign of bugs I wished I hadn\u2019t checked as the mattress cover had reddish-brown stains on it. Later we discovered that one of the pillows had dried blood on it. The pillow slips weren\u2019t big enough to contain the pillows and the sheet didn\u2019t cover the mattress, and the duvet was not encased in a cover, so the bed felt really unhygienic. We were glad to leave. </DOC> This Lodge was the worst we stayed in on all of our 5 week trip in the US. Almost everyone thought it not up to there standards, which in some cases wasn't high. We personally though it dark, dated and dusty. But the bed was comfortable and we weren't in the room much during the day. I would stay there if I had any choice. </DOC> I was along for the ride and wasn't expecting much after reading the reviews. Upon arrival I was pleasantly surprised to find the lobby to be welcoming. The Yavapai Lodge is located across the parking lot from the General Store so that is a huge plus. Once you are checked in you drive around to your room. I found our room to be clean and somewhat modern, maybe we had one of the recently remodeled rooms. The bathroom is pretty basic. What I cared about most was cleanliness and a good nights sleep and Yavapai Lodge checked the boxes. The small cafe that serves coffee and to go items is a great place to grab quick items. If you are looking to sit down the breakfast food in the restaurant looked tasty and reasonably priced. </DOC> It\u2019s not on the rim, those are much more popular, but these rooms are near the Mather Campground so they don\u2019t fill up as quickly as do Bright Angel Lodge, El Tovar and Maswic. That being said, please reserve more than a year in advance. These are simple rooms but after the rim side lodging is taken they sell out amazingly quickly. It is a short walk to the bus stops and to the marketplace where most of your needs can be met. </DOC> Stayed here for two nights while visiting the Grand Canyon. Tried to stay at one of the hotels on the rim, but very happy we got in the Yavapai. Very clean and comfortable room. Beds were very nice and room was large. Short walk to the Yavapai Restaurants, the General Store and shuttle stops to all points in the park. Much less hectic than on the rim. Would highly recommend the Yavapai Lodge and this is where we'll stay upon returning to the Grand Canyon. </DOC> Stayed two nights in the East section and was a wonderful experience. Check in was quick and easy to find our room and it was clean and had body wash,shampoo, and conditioner and ice machine and drink machine on each floor. Bed was comfortable and it was a little dark but did not diminish our experience. If neighbors are noisy you can hear them but we only had this happen one morning as they were leaving. Short walk to rim just down the street and is an easy walk and wonderful to do in morning and sunset.This seems to be in a quieter section of the park and with park shuttle so close this is a easy location with grocery and restaurant and tavern across the street. </DOC> Nice hotels, good room, clean bathroom. Very good for a hotel inside a park, but don\u00b4t expect luxury. I\u00b4ve stayed at the newer set of rooms, can\u00b4t say about the other, seems very different. Major advantage is to stay inside, so can easily go and get back for sunrise and sunshine at best park locations. Downside is that you most likely will have dinner at hotels cafeteria, very poor one",

        "docs": "We had a corner room on the 27th floor, nice view. The room is clean, Keurig machine (Van Houtte), small fridge, safe, A/C, bathrobes. The bathroom is fully renovated with taste. A bit on the small side, but well lit. No bath, but good shower size. Almost everything is walking distance with a Hop On Hop Off bus stop in front of the hotel. Recommended </DOC> A well maintained, high quality and central hotel with great views. A really comfy bed and free Wi-fi all lend to a lovely and refreshing stay. Only downside was the pool & gym being refurbished, but that didn\u2019t detract much from this otherwise excellent hotel. Will go back next time I am in town </DOC> We stayed here for just one night prior to joining a cruise. The hotel is well located for everything, and note there is a stop for the Hop on Hop off sightseeing bus tour just outside the lobby. The decor throughout the hotel is bright and modern. Our room was more than adequate, good size, clean and comfortable with a good bathroom. Nothing particularly fancy but great for an overnight stay. We did not bother to pay extra for a view, and we did have some noise from the street - but only when the window was open. Assuming the price was right we would definitely return </DOC> Thank you fellow TA'ers for recommending this. It is very reasonable,and in a great location. We got a slightly larger, upper floor corner room and it was one of the most spectacular views I ever had plus very large. Really a great place. Nice staff as well. The conference room upstairs has a view that truly is amazing. </DOC> This was our second visit, and we were on the 17th floor this time -no street noise, but the hallways are slightly noisy, if your neighbors aren't considerate. The double queen rooms are much roomier than the single king we had last time - chair, end table, large desk & built in fridge as well as a large TV on a dresser were nice additions. A/C is a window unit that was occasionally noisy. Very clean, but on the small side, tub/shower combination. All in all, we're very happy with this hotel </DOC> On the strength of TA reviews, we chose this very nice hotel. Loved the location, we walked everywhere from here. Room had great views, lovely decor, very comfortable beds and plush linen. Restaurant downstairs was very convenient with nice food and friendly service. Only mild niggle is between 4-5 they do a \"courtesy check\"!! Even if you have the do not disturb sign on. I don't understand the reasoning of this and found it intrusive, especially if you were feeling jet lagged or like me trying to nap. Otherwise, I would've given it 5 stars. </DOC> Enjoyed my extended stay at this hotel. Comfortable bed. Spacious room. Only negative is that all rooms have a short distance corridor, so a bit noisy when someone else on your floor enters/exits their room. Excellent, helpful front desk staff. A short walk to many restaurant choices, and the gelato across the street is great ! Nearby is London Drugs (foods, pharmacy, a little bit of everything). </DOC> We booked a superior queen room, but were upgraded to a double queen room Very nice - spacious with a great view. We were on the 25th floor. We had a balcony but only one chair. However, when we asked, they provided another. The bed was very comfortable. The restaurant downstairs served a nice breakfast. The hotel is near a lot of very good restaurants. The staff was friendly and helpful with restaurant suggestions, etc. The bus stops just in front of the hotel and there is a taxi stand. The Hop on Hop Off bus is just up the block. We walked a good deal of the time so it was great to have a hotel so well located. There is a pool and hot tub which were nice after a day spent walking around Stanley Park. I definitely recommend this hotel.",

        "docs": "Walking distance to the waterfront, jogging distance to the Stanley park. You can walk to downtown too. Good neighborhood with some bars and quick bite places. King size beds were excellent! Room was spacious. We had a hiccup with the laundry- it was done, but it delivered. I had to pick it up from the luggage room downstairs. Breakfast could be a bit faster, waiting for 20 min or so is a bit slow in my book. Swimming pool is ok, but not air conned on a hot summer day. Small and cozy hotel. Liked it! </DOC> The rooms are well appointed and clean. our double queen was large with a view of the city. Shower only in the bathroom, which was fine with me. Facilities in the hotel or close-by. Park just inside the garage entrance to register then park; lots of spaces on the rooftop but need room key to gain access. </DOC> Of course hotels never tell you in advance that they\u2019re doing renovations... We needed a quiet hotel because we had a midnight flight departing Canada and wanted to sleep during the day. This was not possible because of the construction noise. I imagine the hotel is a great place to stay when not under construction as it\u2019s right on Robson street. The bed is very comfortable and the view is lovely. </DOC> The front desk staff were extremely welcoming and helpful. The room was large and comfortable. The bathroom amenities were top notch. The bed was very comfortable which made for a wonderful sleep. This hotel is located right on Robson Street amid many restaurants and varied shopping. It is a very busy street, but the room was quiet. We thoroughly enjoyed visiting with friends in the coffee shop area of the restaurant. We had a great stay and would not hesitate to recommend this hotel. It was on the high end of the price range but the staff and comfort levels made up for the expense. </DOC> Make sure you ask for a high floor room to get great views. It will be worth it Good location, fairly central and really very comfortable beds. Spacious room too. For size of room, bathroom was a tad on the small size but not a major negative </DOC> On first sight we thought that this was a very dowdy and dreary hotel, but closer inspection revealed that there actually wasn't anything wrong with the place, it's just that all the decor, furniture and carpets are dark brown! The rooms themselves (we had a queen superior and a King superior) are large and well appointed and the position in town with a public car park next door is very convenient. We didn't have any meals here so can't comment on that, but for our overnight stay for our first night in Vancouver this was a perfectly adequate clean, comfortable hotel. </DOC> We stayed here recently and would say that the hotel offers great value, our suite was large with good views of Stanley Park and English Bay. The room was clean and the staff helpful, the hotel is well located and most things are a short walk away </DOC> This was a very nice hotel fro the price. They put us on a high floor with a nice view. The room was spotless, comfortable, good size, with desk, a lot of windows and a big bathroom. It was very convenient to have an adjoining parking lot and a restaurant in the lobby serving breakfast and lunch. You can't beat the location for shopping and restaurants. The front desk was very courteous and efficient. I needed to print a document and they took care of it for me at the front desk since their business center is under repair.",

        "docs": "We spent 2 nights in Vancouver in October. We chose the Blu Horizon because of its excellent reviews and location. We were certainly not disappointed. The room we given was spacious,clean and provided extraordinary views of central downtown and the mountains beyond. it was also very central and adjacent to public transport. We would definitely recommend and would not hesitate to stay here when returning to Vancouver. </DOC> The hotel is slap-back on the main shopping street in Vancouver, however, it isn't noisy. Our large room (suite, perhaps they all are) was a wrap-round and think they all are, which means you get large windows on two sides, as well as a balcony. The beds were very comfy and everything was very clean with good facilities. The hotel is somewhat bland - perfectly friendly staff but it lacks any character. Maybe that's a small price given the location. There's a small cafe on the ground floor with seating outside. Very comfortable for a short (2 night) stay. </DOC> We have been coming to the Blue Horizon for over 25 years. It is a well located and comfortable hotel with friendly staff and good facilities. One thing that has changed over that time is the harbour views - there are lots of buildings between the hotel and the harbour nowadays. </DOC> This hotel located in a street with many restaurants and shops. We stayed in a corner room that includes a balcony with a city view and it was superb! It has two queens size beds, what allowed our grandson to stay with us. The staff is friendly and the room very confortable and big. </DOC> We stayed at the Blue Horizon for 5 nights in September. Our room on the 26th Floor was spacious and had lovely views over Coal Bay. Staff were friendly and helpful. Quality organic bathroom products were provided. Unlike the previous review I found the shower pressure to be excellent. We walked to Gastown and Hornby St to catch the ferry to Granville Island and Yaletown. It's about a 20 minute walk to Stanley Park. The Abode cafe was good for breakfast. The Chinese restaurant across the road Chongquing was excellent. </DOC> Robson Street has many restaurants of diverse ethnicities. Lots of shops just down the street. Staff is excellent and friendly. Ample self parking in building. Rooms were all corner rooms with windows on two sides and one balcony. Rooms were very spacious with fridge and lots of outlets for electronic gear. Floors above 18 had great views of the bay and city. Got a comp upgrade to the 26 floor, just for asking. 3 available elevators were small sometimes made for a wait. WiFi was free and with adequate speed. Red Hop On Hop off out front and Blue HoHo just down the block. We went with the Blue HoHo since it made one big loop rather than 2 loops and a transfer by the Red HoHo. </DOC> Stayed here for two nights of a three night visit to Vancouver - had to move Hotels as they couldn't fit us in for the 3 so book early. Vancouver is very popular, especially during the cruise season, as a lot of people overnight in Vancouver before picking up their Alaskan cruise. Easy check in and out, then quick lift to the 39th floor - never stayed that high and I liked having the balcony and city view even though it was raining for most of our visit. Was very surprised how much high rise there is in the city. Room was small with Queen bed but very clean and comfortable. We had breakfast in the hotel both mornings which was very good and reasonably priced I think for the city. Location is great for walking to restaurants, Stanley Gardens, Coal Harbour, etc. Would stay again if visiting another time. </DOC> We stayed at the hotel for a few nights and were surprised at how nice it was. Every room has a balcony which doesn't overlook anyone else, and there is plenty of space to spread your stuff out. The bathrooms are very modern and clean, the bed is super comfortable and the rooms are quite quiet. The only noise we heard was when guests got out of the lift talking too loudly. We were on level 14 and there was virtually no noise at all from this very busy road. The hotel is in a great location, central to downtown Vancouver. From here you can walk everywhere, and there are masses of cafes and restaurants close by. We would definitely stay here again.",

        "docs": "Great hotel, great location, great room. Its hard to be critical here. The service was excellent from the time got out of the cab from the airport, a lot of help getting my bags to my room from the Bell staff. Within a few minutes of arriving, my house keeping staff had remembered my name and was there for turn down service. My room was on the 22nd floor, with a wide view of the city, Coal Harbour, Stanley Park and a bit of the Lions Gate Bridge. The hotel is only a minutes walk at most from the Conference Centre, Seabus Terminal, Harbour Seaplane terminal, and easy walk to most of downtown and 10 mins at most to Gastown. Just be careful when jumping in a cab at the airport, there are several Fairmonts in Vancouver downtown, make sure you tell the driver the right one. </DOC> We only stayed for one night on our way home from Europe.We had a very large room on the 23rd floor with a fabulous view. The staff, particularly at breakfast, were very nice and friendly despite being busy. All top notch. I would highly recommend this hotel. Handy to everywhere. </DOC> Stayed in corner room on 21st floor. When we arrived, Chris the most amazing customer service check in staff, changed our room to the higher floor after I requested an upgrade. The room wasn't ready due to the switch and suggested we go grab food at the restaurant, which we did. Chris stopped by our table while eating and hand delivered us our keys. Wow, he really made our stay wonderful. He always greeted us by name, he really made our stay start out and stay wonderful. The room was beautiful, the condition however was dated and needs work. The bathroom tile was chipped and had glue to fill in cracks which really cheapened a very expensive room. Besides the dated room, the stay was great, valet was prompt and helpful. </DOC> Though located on the waterfront, the property is way overpriced as we paid a great deal for a deluxe room which has a partial view of the harbor and that was pretty much of the freight area and not the actual harbor lights. The bathroom tubes are slippery with no grab bars and there were no chairs other than the desk chair in the room. The restaurant was incredibly expensive. We have stayed at Fairmonts in Banff and Lake Louise and this was not nearly as comfortable for the money we paid. The other Fairmonts had refridgerators and bottled water for two. This property has only a minibar and no room for cooling any drinks. Also the WiFi was terribly problematic making it difficult to stay in contact with family members during a family medical emergency. Disappointing. </DOC> Enjoyed my stay here during a conference. Service was great, location even better (connected to the convention center by underground passage). Room is big and roomy and the beds very comfy. Will definitely stay at this hotel again. </DOC> We booked a Fairmont gold room for 4 nights while we explored the city. Could not have been better. Our room was nice enough, nothing special but comfortable. What made the property outstanding to us was the club lounge. Beautiful terrace with views of the waterfront.... we enjoyed breakfast every morning sitting outside and then relaxed after our tourist travels. The best part was the club staff, they could not have been more agreeable and so helpful with restaurant recommendations and reservations. Must also mention the location, perfect for exploring the city. </DOC> Perfectly located, with a view and close to Vancouver Harbor and Canada Place, this hotel is ideal for a visit to the city. Fairmont does it right with its polite and responsive staff-bellmen, concierge, desk staff, housekeeping etc. We had a partial view of the harbor and overlooked the hotel's garden and aviary where their homemade honey is sourced. This hotel is an easy walk to most of the city with many attractions and restaurants nearby. </DOC> Great location for walking and enjoying the waterfront and shopping. Across from the cruise ship terminal. The ARC restaurant breakfast buffet was amazing! The staff was very friendly and helpful. Our flight was delayed and getting there at 3:00am we still had all the great check-in service. Close to a Tim Hortons for a little snack. We were there for our 35th Anniversary trip on the Rocky Mountaineer and had special chocolate covered strawberries waiting for us in our room when we arrived. They were great!",

Our room was just perfect; and we watched the cruise ships come and go. I would definitely return to this hotel, </DOC> We stayed at this hotel in advance of joining our Cruise in Vancouver BC. It is located on the waterfront across the street from the Pier that is used for all the Cruise Ships and also has a Convention Center. You actually only have to walk across the street to enter the Pier facility for embarking and disembarking from a Cruise. It is located central to seeing most things in downtown Vancouver - the Gaslight District is only a two block walk from the hotel. As one would expect from a Fairmont, the staff, restaurants and rooms are very upscale. They have rooms overlooking the Harbor and Gold Levels on Floors 8 & 9 that are a \"Hotel within a Hotel\" with outside patios in the lounge areas. Highly recommend this hotel. </DOC> My husband and I spent 2 nights here. Our room offered a wonderful view over the water with mountains in the background. After dark we enjoyed the colors and lights of Canada Place. Bed was comfortable. Staff was friendly and professional. Cross the street and you can walk for miles along the seawall. Great restaurants close by. However we had dinner in the hotel restaurant and it was superb. </DOC> I\u2019ve stayed at this property 20+ times and really like it. My company has a preferred rate so we send them a lot of business. During my visit last week I was informed at check-in that since the reservation was booked through a third party (our corporate travel agency) that I would not get credit for the stay towards loyalty. I have enjoyed the top tier status at Fairmont for two years now which appears to be a thing of the past since all my travel is booked through our agency. I was told by staff this is a \u201chard and fast rule\u201d of the new owners... amazing, considering I imagine much of their business is booked through travel agencies. The PanPafic across the street (literally) will enjoy my business moving forward. </DOC> Really nice room. Clean and quiet. View from bathroom of the Harbour. Staff very nice and great express check in system. I stayed here for a night on my way to Asia, partly because of how nice this hotel treated my parents a few weeks ago during their stay. Did not disappoint I'm just sorry I did not try to breakfast. Will be back. </DOC> Great location and shops below the hotel. I received an email offer prior to staying which is why I booked with them. The offer was for $50 per day while staying with them. When I checked in they rescinded the offer because I booked with a discounted room. No where in the email did it state if you got a discounted rate you would not receive the $50 per day credit. </DOC> We stayed here for one night prior to a cruise. Unfortunately our flights were delayed and we ended up getting to the hotel at 8pm which meant only a 16 hour stay. Nevertheless we enjoyed the room which was clean and quiet with a nice view of the 3rd floor garden which has beehives in addition to herbs used in the kitchen. Staff was efficient and friendly. Excellent location across the street from the cruise terminal, eliminating the need for a bus transfer and allowing us to checkout at our leisure. Highly recommended. </DOC> This is my second time around and I still believe it is a magnificent property. Close to all attractions, modern, clean, great staff (special thanks to Kat, she was great, great, great). Our room was spacious and with magnificent views. Food very very nice as well. The shower..... OMG. We didn't want to get out of the water ever. I love this Fairmont and will return each time possible.",

        "docs": "this was my second stay at this hotel. Great pre check-in contact. They emailed me the morning of my stay to verify my wishes and the room was ready at 12:30pm. The rooms are quite large and very comfy with a large bath, big windows and comfortable beds. Pricey, but look for specials. </DOC> Straight off the plane to arrive to friendly welcome and surprising news that even though it was early they had a room ready for us. Nice clean spacious room overlooking the inner harbour. Staff were all welcoming and friendly. That extended to the Fairmont breakfast. The attention to detail was there. For example, half way through my stay I turn up in a newly collected hire car. They still recognized me as already being checked in and correlated me to my room and car instantly. On departure luggage was delivered directly into the car with unasked for help to get us to the next destination. Recommend this hotel to anyone. </DOC> WOW!! Nothing but a great experience at The Fairmont Waterfront! Not a negative comment? Valet & bellmen engaging and helpful Checkin was perfect Concierge- friendly & informative Clean comfortable room Checkout- perfect Will be visiting in September & cant wait Thank you Waterfront for the great experience! </DOC> Just returned from 7 nights at this property. Excellent location and meeting venue onsite. Food and service was also very good as were the rooms. Gold level service was exceptional. Walking distance to much of downtown Vancouver. </DOC> I recently spent 5 nights at this hotel. Everything about the experience was perfect, from a beautiful room with water and mountains view, to the spacious fitness center with a sauna, hot tub and heated outdoor pool. The best thing was the employees, who were cordial and generous with their time. The cleaning woman called me Ms. Tamayo, the lounge employees were unfailingly nice, and had a champagne bottle and chocolates sent to my room when they heard it was my birthday. Breakfast at both the hotel restaurant and the 8th floor lounge is plentiful and as healthy or not as you wish. I\u2019m now a huge fan of Fairmont. I had such an amazing time that I forgot to take pictures! </DOC> We arrived by seaplane so this was an easy walk from the terminal. Even though it was early, our rooms were ready and we met others on our trip in the ARC restaurant. Had the seafood chowder--excellent. The beds are comfortable and the service is very friendly. We were there before a Rocky Mountaineer trip so they had reserved the rooms--no view of the harbor at the Waterfront! </DOC> Highly recommend this beautiful Fairmont hotel. Superb service, beautiful views, outstanding restaurant . Eat at ARC...delicious! Good gym facility & outdoor pool. Great location too. Room with the view of the harbour was spectacular ! Would stay here again! </DOC> Stayed for one night only as a stopover but love it. Very elegant rooms, very quite and I loved the staff, specifically in the restaurant. Breakfast staff was super friendly and the buffet exeptional. Anytime again",

        "docs": "Known for,it's upscale rooms and amenities, thus fairmont doesn't disappoint. We enjoyed the hot tub, pool,and exercise facilities, but the location is in the heart of the action on the pier. Large ships sail for Alaska and elsewhere from here, the hop,on hop,off buses stop here, and it's a short walk to the Olympic torch and convention center. Beds are comfortable, rooms are large, and well equipped with fridge and microwave. </DOC> The Fairmont is very well situated for a cruise as it\u2019s right across the street from the port. It\u2019s also in a good location to walk to bars and restaurants. The hotel however seemed very old school in a number of ways. The staff weren\u2019t very welcoming. The shampoo and soaps were rose scented which gave me headaches and reminded me of something my granny used to use. The safe was high up and hard to reach. There were automatic charges if you remove things from the frig and no room to put a bottle of my own water. The prices for in room snacks were crazy. The beds also were noisy anytime one of us rolled over. We paid US $650 for two nights and that just wasn\u2019t worth it. Many hotel chains are much more with the times and the Fairmont should join in. </DOC> Very well located, close to everything, with easy public transportation. Hotel of network with very good comfort, excellent accommodation with good bed, wifi, size of the room. It's very worth it. There are bedrooms with fantastic views </DOC> This is a great location - right on the waterfront and across from cruise terminal. The staff if helpful and friendly. The rooms are spacious (and spacious bathroom) and a great view of the harbor. It can get a little crowded at the bell desk when they have a cruise group coming in but they seem to work it out quickly. great hotel. </DOC> We spent one night only in May, in hindsight this was too short. The hotel let us leave bags for a few days while we went to Victoria which was great. Check in was easy and quick and our room on floor 11 had a great view over the harbour to the mountains. The fitness centre and sauna were clean and well run and the pool area popular as it was a warm day. All requests to the hotel, such as milk for coffee, a shave kit etc were not a problem and delivered very quickly. The hotel is in a great location waking distance to the cruise terminal, gastown, the lookout, waterfront and anywhere else you would want to go. When back in Vancouver i'd stay again, the hotel lived uoto my expectations in every way. </DOC> Room great, with a spectacular view of the harbour, a good place to recover from a week of over indulging on board ship in readiness for the next stage on the train. The location, just over the road from the terminal makes it an ideal choice. The bar downstairs was lively and the music, though a bit loud for quite conversation, was good. Breakfast was good. </DOC> My wife and I stayed here for 6 nights in a Signature Harbour View room measuring 43 square meters during our recent holiday in USA and Canada. The room was spacious and luxurious. The window view of the harbour was nice. </DOC> Can't say enough about how great this hotel is, only had two days and wanted just to stay. Go for gold floor if you can, absolutely great lounge with outdoor space to dru-ink in the beautful view and summer weather.Room large with comfortable bed, lovely bath and very clean and up to date. Location is very good for sight seeing.",

The views are not great--most rooms look into a wall of the hotel or the building next door. Great location near train station and major business district. fine for single travelers. not great for couples. </DOC> The service at this Fairmont exceeded our expectations. From the doorman to the recption at check in and the conceirge all very pleasant and helpful. Our suite was beautiful with a corner fireplace, dining table, sitting area with a couch with a comfortable king bed and pillows. </DOC> Great central location downtown across from Union Station and a quick walk to the convention center. Rooms were immaculate- clean recently renovated in classic style. Always friendly and courteous front desk staff. </DOC> This is one of the largest hotels I have stayed in and very well organised. The location is great for walking by the lake and getting to the Eaton Centre for some excellent shopping. It is also opposite the staton where the airport train stops which made getting there really simple. The gym and pool were clean and well equipped, even providing complimentary bottles of water and fruit. Much appreciated. I would stay here again. </DOC> After spending a few days at another hotel In TO, I decided to try the Fairmount after my flight was cancelled. My bed was much more comfortable and overall it was a much better stay. I loved the coveted and trendy Le Labo products as well and loved how modern my room felt the hotel itself is very beautiful and there is beautiful decor and art everywhere. Loved the portraits of The Queen especially. The service everywhere from the front desk to the restaurants was top knotch. Highly recommend this hotel. Next time I return to TO for business, this will be my go-to hotel! Definitely worth it. </DOC> Great night to stay here as we had tickets to a Jay's Game and its only a 13 minute walk to the Rogers Center. We were about an hour and a half early for check in but wasn't a problem. Check in girl was very sincere and sweet. No problem to have a little bar fridge brought up to your room if needed and no extra cost. Love these older hotels with so much character and charm, right down to the little glass soap dish in the bathroom. The grandeur in the lobby oozes a greater time gone by. We will be back. </DOC> I was forced to stay overnight near Toronto City airport due to a cancelled flight, and saw a good rate for this hotel so decided to try it. It is what you would expect for a Fairmont with this reputation. It was comfortable, and the service was excellent. It is an excellent hotel. </DOC> Stayed here for 10 days in a couple of different rooms over a two week period. Service was excellent, staff very friendly. The hotel has a lovely atmosphere with some old world charm in the middle of the CBD. Rooms were very clean and a reasonable size. Very convenient location opposite Union Station. We did have two fire evacuations during our stay!",

The place is just wonderful with many great shops onsite. The Library Bar and Restaurant the best in the hotel. </DOC> Christmas tradition for the last 8 years while visiting family. All worth it for the spectacular lobby. Can\u2019t imagine spending the holidays at any other hotel. What better tradition than a Christmas Eve nightcap martini at Epic? See you next year! </DOC> We stayed on the Gold Floor - first time at this property but not the first time in the Fairmont chain. The check in clerk was very friendly. The check out person was also very good and she ensured that our stay was linked with my Presidents Club membership. Breakfast on the gold florr could use more staff and more choice, but overall tis was a very nice night out! </DOC> We've stayed at Fairmont hotels in a number of cities. The Royal York, one of the original railway hotels, is one of the best. The impressive lobby is oddly most comfortable and welcoming, and the large seemingly traditional decor in the rooms is actually high-tech with a big flat screen TV and more than ample power and USB ports. The reception staff was helpful and the concierge staff was friendly and knowledgeable. Our favorite spot was the Library Bar, a more intimate venue than the other ground floor bar, but beware (in a good way) of the \"Birdbath Martini\". It includes more than 3 ounces of alcohol. </DOC> We came for two nights looking for a nice hotel and a good location. Our pets were welcomed and the room was lovely .The service was great. The only very minor drawback was that the hotel is large, so it takes a while to get from a to b. That said, it never felt like you weren't getting personal attention or like you had to wait for anything . </DOC> I found this hotel to be pretentious and for no good reason. I understand that the lobby is the real draw but it was closed. The front desk staff were unhelpful, the rooms were very below expectations. The bath is just a vinyl bath fitting, the tiles were stained, the sink taps were corroding. I guess those things are to be expected in a historic property but I found it to be a bit frustrating. The construction noise was right above our room. The charge for a tiny bottle of water in the minibar was outrageous $7 when most hotels offer it for free. The air was so dry you really need to be providing free water for guests. I'd like to see the hotel after renovations but would probably elect to just visit the bar someday for a drink rather than stay there. We moved to the Delta and it was lightyears ahead of this property. </DOC> This was a one night stay prior to a flight and we were only looking for a clean, comfortable room and bed. When were arrived around 6:00 pm we were offered an upgrade for $40 per night! (I really hate hotels doing this), but we declined and thought we might be given a poor room because of our decline. Not so. Our room, although not updated, was warm and comfortable, clean, had a great view and great bed with superior linens. The bathroom was small, but had nice amenities and the water pressure was great and temperature superb. We were glad that we had chosen the Royal York. Would I recommend? Yes, would I stay again, yes. </DOC> A charming hotel, the Fairmont Royal York plays on the Royal visit - which now happened a number of years ago. The hotel has everything you need - spacious rooms, a well equipped gym and pool, direct access to public transport and some wonderful bars and restaurants. That said, it does feel a bit tired. If you want something modern and fresh - this may not be for you - but if you want to indulge in the luxury of a hotel catering to people who want to relax and unwind - this is your place. The staff are super friendly and helpful and I had a great week here.",

We were granted a one night stay along with a cocktail party as part of the unveiling. The whole experience was a dream. The room was lovely facing West with am amazing view of the CN Tower. The party was on the 19th floor in such a lovely banquet room. The kids took full advantage of the pool, swimming in the evening and again the next morning. We had an amazing breakfast in the Epic Lounge as well. The kids are already asking to go back and we just left the hotel this morning. </DOC> I wish we could have stayed longer, but we were on a pace with a ten day trip. The breakfast experience was definitely the best of the trip with the buffet quality and the impeccable service. Our room was fine, but I will be glad when the trend of duvets has passed. It is hard to get the temperature just right with those things. The swimming pool was great for a few minutes of laps and exercise. All the little bottles in our rooms - time to ditch them and go a bit more eco friendly with multi serve containers like you have in your fine locker room. Be sure to ask for robes if they aren't in your room. In general, a grand stay. </DOC> Stayed one night during a long weekend and this place was perfect. Location wise you can't complain since it's right front of Union Station and most places are in walking distance. Classic room with good shower and amenities, the only downfall is overnight valet parking. $70 for parking? common!! Travelled many big cities but I thought this was ridiculous!! </DOC> We stayed in the original tower on the 18th floor. Our room was very spacious with a seating /living room and then 2 double beds. It also had 2 bathrooms. It was probably 2 very small hotel rooms converted into one larger room. Hotel is filled with history. British royal family stays there. If you stand across the street in front of Union Station and look at the hotel, you can tell it was built in the shape of a throne. Very much enjoyed our stay. Staff was responsive. Room was super quiet. </DOC> This lovely historic hotel is centrally located in downtown Toronto, within walking distance of the waterfront, public transport and shops. Efforts have been made to preserve its history with a section of the mezzanine level dedicated to this. The high, painted ceiling at the Lobby floor is impressive. Our room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. Issues that were repercussions of errors made by the Receptionist during check-in were were promptly and professionally dealt with by Management and we thank them for this. </DOC> Pro\u2019s: well maintained classic hotel; excellent customer service; well above average cleanliness; very convenient location - across the street from main transit/rail station; great on-site restaurant and bar. Con\u2019s: none! This hotel delivers and the staff and very accommodating! </DOC> Was only doing one night as playing by ear, was impressed with location and staff was great despite buying thrue a cheap wholesaler. i paid a small upgrade fee and was given an upgrade in a room i liked. Thanks </DOC> Stayed for 3 nights during our 2 week vacation around America and Canada. Hotel first class, service, room, location first class. Can not recommend the hotel enough, Right across from union station for easy access to the airport also. Thanks all and thank you also for the surprise chocolates and fruits on our anniversary.",

Would stay again and it is super convenient for the UPS to and from Pearson. </DOC> four of us partook of Sunday Brunch in this establishment. menu was extensive from breakfast items to Beef Wellington. Staff were very courteous and efficient, only too willing to help. Eggs were freshly cooked to order. </DOC> The hotel reminds me of the historical style hotels in New York. Classic look but rooms have been modernized . My room was big and nicely decorated in contemporary style and colors. Biggest issue NO hot water and at 11 pm when I arrived I did not feel to call anyone for help and I was only there one night. It was not nice in -6 weather . The hotel has three restaurants or more so that makes it very convenient and several shops . It only reason u gave a three rating is due to the hot water issue other than that lovely hotel and great location especially for business travel. </DOC> I had heard this was a nice hotel, but it was way better, check in, excellent, I did not arrive until 9:00 pm, and when I got to my lovely room, there was a complimentary cheese plate and a large bottle of water, also A hand written welcome card with my Presidents Club number included for information. The bed was absolutely superb, the bathroom excellent, quite the best experience I have ever had in a hotel. I would love to return. </DOC> Great hotel, perfectly situated within a few minutes walk of the lake front. All the staff have been fantastic and the service is faultless. We had a delightful room on the 11 floor. The hotel has great amenities...highly recommended. </DOC> We were lucky enough to stay here for just over \u00a3100 per night and there was nothing you could fault about the hotel. The staff are so professional, the rooms are excellent with the location superb. The pool and jacuzzi were a nice extra, wifi available in the lobby which was very helpful. We loved our stay here and would love to return one day at the right price. </DOC> Husband stayed here for a conference and they were put in the old wing with no view. Colleagues complained of noises (elevators). The bathroom was cramped even though it was renovated (sink counter impinges on the toilet). The bed was comfortable. The furniture was tired. The WIFI did not work even though we are Fairmont Presidents' Club members and it should be free. Fairmont is a good chain but this was a bit old (like the Empress hotel in Victoria) and there are other more modern choices around town for reasonable prices. </DOC> We received a very warm welcome from the staff on the Gold Level. They always have time for some conversation and they go out of their way to make the stay enjoyable and special. Lots of excellent food and a wonderful selection of wines. The rooms are great and housekeeping does a through job. The location with underground access to the subway is wonderful in bad weather. Lots of restaurants, museums and things to do nearby. We just love the hotel, especially the Gold Level. Take the splurge, you will not regret it.",

Check in was on the lower level as they were doing a massive lobby registration. This wasn\u2019t a huge inconvenience and the lobby lounge was still open and very busy. Staff were all friendly and rooms were comfortable and traditional. Two other big positives are that it is directly across from the UP express to Pearson and Union Station and everything you need is on the PATH right down the escalator inside....Shoppers,Starbucks,LCBO....you name it. </DOC> From the moment we stepped into that amazingly decorated Christmassy lobby we knew it would be a fabulous visit! The staff were all so welcoming and friendly, we had a great room, very comfortable and very quiet considering it was 2 days before Christmas! Excellent position and no worries about getting cold with The Path connecting you to the Eaton Centre for a spot of shopping! Lots of super restaurants nearby and an easy walk to either CN Tower, waterside or any of the many other attractions in Toronto! Special mention to the very cheerful valet parking gentleman, so helpful and kind in such freezing, snowy weather !!! Luxurious, grand, fabulous Fairmont, we will return!! </DOC> Very classy hotel bring back the golden era of travel. Great food. Great attention from the staff at all levels. Would definitely recommend. Only two knocks. Arrival I had to pull all of our luggage from the car while the greeter watched and the breakfast buffet was very crowded one morning. </DOC> We dined at the Epic Restaurant. Royal York Hotel. Toronto, on our last day, as part of a birthday celebration trip to Eastern Canada. I had stayed here twenty years ago as part of a trip to Western Canada staying in a collection of Fairmont Hotels. The food and service was exceptional and was far the best restaurant we had dined in on the whole of the trip. Our waiter was amazing. It was sheer class from start to finish. We had a glass of excellent Ontario sparkling wine, followed by a fabulous Ontario white. A nice touch to finish, was a surprise from the kitchen of an iconic Royal York Hotel bag filled with some delicious cookies for our return journey. Thank you Epic Restaurant for make our dining experience feel very special. </DOC> Great location and really one of the best hotels to stay as a tourist. A few tips; 1. Parking wont be cheap. However leave your car and take subway or walk. 2. Close to lots of good expensive and mid priced restaurants There is a tim hortons just outside the hotel so if u want cheap breakfast that is a good bet 3. There are many room choices. New. Old. Real old and wow! Don\u2019t hesitate to ask to see th room.. consider getting room that looks to the lake 10 minute walk to rogets centre, cn tower, ripleys, scotia bank rink. 25 min walk to eaton centre. </DOC> Very large and sedate old property. Generally well maintained, although some wear on the edges (elevators can be cranky in parts of the hotel). Many lovely public spaces. Rooms spacious and well accommodated. Service variable - at times moderate waits at the checkin and out lines (had to go to checkout because of error on bill). </DOC> can't be beaten for location as right across from the UPExpress platform. 10 minutes walk to the waterfront and on the doorstep of all things Toronto. Rooms are very small and recently refurbished and theres a good gastropub underneath in the PATH. They are about to start a massive overhaul of the lobby so will be interesting to see how this turns out. </DOC> Recently stayed at the Royal York early December 2017. Again, this is my go to hotel when staying in downtown Toronto. The hotel stay is very friendly and helpful. Had a room facing the ACC with a partial view of the water. The bed was comfortable, bathroom was excellent, room decor was newly renovated. Again, 5 star stay and will continue to return when back in Toronto. Thanks Royal York!",

Room booked months in advance was apparently unavailable and I was left in limbo standing, like a lemon, at reception (check in should have ushered me to a seat) whilst check in disappeared to find alternative accommodation and allocate it to me.Room adequate. No complimentary mineral water provided as one would expect in an hotel of this class, and no bedroom slippers. Concierge services were helpful and amiable as one would expect. Breakfast staff also amiable but the pot of tea I ordered was possibly the worst brew I have ever tasted, and I know how a good cuppa should taste. Library bar staff willing and pleasant. Check out queues were long and slow. As a whole the hotel experience was disappointing and the historic architecture and style did not offset the glaring shortcomings. </DOC> I am so surprised this hotel gets such rave reviews. Yes, our room was very nice, clean, seemed recently renovated with comfortable beds, but this is where the positive review ends. Stayed at the Toronto Fairmont to attend an evening function. Open bar was staffed with personnel that had such bad attitudes, had sour looks on their faces and an obvious disdain and disgust for the guest they were serving. Put a real damper on the evening. That in addition to the terrible food just made the whole evening a disappointment. Have stayed at some amazing Fairmonts where the rooms, friendly professional staff and delicious food are top notch. This is not one of them. Would not recommend. </DOC> This was our second stay at the Royal York and won't be our last :) we flew into City Center with a friend to watch a Raptors game and decided to stay at the beautifully renovated Royal York, check in was excellent, the rooms were excellent. After game drinks at the Royal York was a joy and breakfast was sheer perfection :) Can't wait to go back!! </DOC> I always love the comfort and predictability of The Royal York, and it's Gold Floor. I had requested an upgraded room if possible online when they had confirmed my reservation, but received no response to that request - and a small room. Disappointing because I stay there frequently. Not much of a complaint but found staff to be somewhat less responsive or on top of its game. There were different staff at gold floor lounge so not the regulars. I usually get multiple bottles of water in my room based on my profile ask but this is first time in many months or years this did not happen. If this is the worst that happens, I'm doing pretty good. Otherwise, love the lounge breakfast and gym facilities. </DOC> Spent 3 nights here recently of which one was on the 15th floor where the rooms are much better but you would expect that for $500 a night! I found the bed too soft during my stay as part of a group. Dinner in the restaurant was good but was surprised to see a La Chaine des Rotisseur plaque at the entrance and then been told that they are not a member anymore! </DOC> The location was outstanding, service great, facilities and places to eat and drink really good - but the noise in the room was not good. The walls are thin enough you could hear the people in the room next door and the argument in the hall. Any people walking along the hall even just chatting could be heard. We still recommend as the location and the actual room were nice and accommodating. Opposite Union station a plus, direct access to the Path is a huge advantage in winter. The Library bar was a highlight. Really good staff and great atmosphere. </DOC> We chose to stay here because of the convenience of it being across the street from Union Station. Unfortunately we were kept at the airport for over three hours and ended up having to take a taxi since the Up Express had stopped running by 1 o'clock so we arrived at about 2 in the morning. However the bellman was still prompt in coming outside to collect our luggage and our check-in was very quick. The room was luxurious and perfect and we had a quiet night of sleep. Lovely breakfast the next morning in the caf\u00e9 downstairs and then it was just a quick walk across the street to catch our train at Union Station. My only complaint was they charge for Wi-Fi in the room. I would definitely stay here again",

The room was excellent as well. I have never seen a hotel room with hardfood floors before. It was unique and nice. There was no plugs near the bed though which was somewhat of a hassle. Bathrooms and views were excellent. I would come back and recommend others come here. PS Insider tip. The little black knob pictured is the light switch that turns off the headboard light. </DOC> First-time trip to Toronto! My family stayed at the Radisson after a detailed on-line review of all the hotels in the area. Glad we chose the Radisson, which has a superb waterfront location, within walking distance of the harbor/boat tours/shopping/restaurants/etc. We were also happy with the 5th Floor pool on a hot, sunny day. Don't worry, as the lakefront breezes keep the tanners relatively cool. Front desk clerks were VERY helpful, teaching us how to catch the Transit and helping us find our way to Graffiti Alley. The rooms were ultra-modern, quiet, and comfortable. Free wi-fi worked well. The double-decker trolley tours (which we did not do) picked up right beside the hotel. We would gladly stay here in the future if we make our way back to Toronto. </DOC> A hotel in a great location with good and helpful staff but a little old. The room we were given was large, nicely equipped, no mini bar by the way and clean. Overall it was a nice place especially for the price we paid but it is not a 4* hotel. It might have been once upon a time but now it needs some maintenance. Breakfast was ok and priced correctly at C$22 p.p. </DOC> We stayed there for 2 nights. The hotel is very well situated. We got room 635, the room looked clean. The wood floor was full of strikes and the bathroom needed some elbow grease. The shower caulking was getting full of mildew and so was the sinkhole. Otherwise all was fine, the bed is comfortable and the room was quite large. </DOC> we stayed here for a couple of nights while on the way to niagra, this hotel was very warming and friendly staff. the room was very spacious and a great big bed which was very comfortable. we had a meal in the hotel on the 5th floor ,Scott the waiter was very helpful and nothing was to much trouble. right on the lake and close to the city. we would recommend this hotel. </DOC> Could not be better located In my opinion. 15 minute walk fro Billy Bishop Airport. 10 minute walk to CN Tower, Rogers Centre and Aquarium. Right on the harbour and its good lakefront walks. Streetcar line out front. Newly renovated so rooms are modern and clean with all amenities hat you would expect. Beautiful views of CN tower from our room...606... Excellent value for price in a very expensive city, likely because it is not in heart of city....but everything is truly very accessible in good weather. 24 hour fine food store, Rabba, across street, as well as other nearby dining options as well as Amsterdam Brew Pub. Good option to consider </DOC> This hotel overlooks Lake Ontario just blocks from the CNN tower, the Convention Center and Air Canada Center. Rooms are comfortable, clean with very comfortable beds (ours was a requested King), our own Keurig coffee maker and small refrigerator. (No microwave, but a very uncomplicated safe.) The hotel has a very exercise room with first class machines and weights. THe pool is outdoors but heated and comfortable. It is long enough for dedicated lap swimmers, although you must walk through the breakfast-lunch-dinner restaurant to get to the pool. However robes and slippers are in every room and there is a changing room with showers in the pool area. THe restaurant includes a nice full-breakfast buffet and a limited but suitable dinner menu. There is a large brewpub next door with a large food selection but noisy! Across the street is Gonoe Sushi which is well worth the visit. </DOC> POSITIVES + Customer service is phenomenal! From from desk to housekeeping, service is easily the best yet in Toronto. + Location cannot be beat. Right on the waterfront with easy access to Union Station, Scotiabank Arena (Air Canada Centre), Rogers Centre (Skydome), and streetcar at front door will take you right to Toronto Island Airport. + Very nicely renovated including wood floors and double shower in guest rooms. + Staff is empowered and is proactive. We had a couple of noise related issues during our stay but the staff promptly attended to them as soon as they were made aware. NEGATIVES - Ask for a room away from front entrance as street noise can be loud. Lakeside, courtyard facing, or higher floor rooms are best. Overall, a great hotel in a very convenient location. We will definitely stay here again for the customer service alone.",

        "docs": "I stayed in the hotel in May 2015 and this time around was completely satisfied once again. Rooms are large, bright and airy and the location on the Lake is gorgeous--even better now that the extensive construction on Queen's Quay is complete. With this visit I was able to take the UP Express train from the airport to Union Station--easy, convenient, and the right price. This hotel is just across the road from the Rogers Centre and an easy walk to either Union Station or the Air Canada Centre. During this visit, I tried the breakfast buffet and it was a good value and delicious. I highly recommend the Radisson Admiral Harbourfront! </DOC> Stayed here for 3 nights, right on the waterfront and an easy walk into the city. Friendly staff, good size rooms, we had a great view of the CN Tower, perhaps rooms with a view over the lake were dearer? Very quiet in the restaurant for both breakfast and dinner. Waiter at breakfast on all 3 mornings was eager to please and very attentive, he should be congratulated as an ambassador for Radisson. Recommended hotel! </DOC> I liked this hotel. The decor sets it apart, with the rooms having a mod 50's look about them. There was a bit of dust in the corners but it was otherwise quite clean. As I find everywhere in Canada, the staff were pleasant and responsive. Two drawbacks keep it from a perfect rating. One, the rooms are incredibly loud, with large gaps under the doors that let in any noises from the hall. (It blows my mind that hotels do this -- perhaps it is needed for the HVAC systems?) Two, there's a perfume used when cleaning the rooms and the windows can't be opened. Personally I don't like this location. The Toronto waterfront is set apart by an elevated highway and doesn't feel integrated with the rest of the city. It is pretty though. </DOC> The location is good even if it's not in the heart of Toronto. The rooms are clean and the front desk people are helpful. The garage and elevator to the garage could use a little work but lets face it that's not where most hotels spend their money. This is not a five star hotel so the expectations are lower. </DOC> Wonderful location to downtown events at Scotiabank Arena or Rogers Centre. Amsterdam Brewery right outside the hotel. Waterfront location can't be beat. The service was great. Parking is underground at the hotel. It's $26+tax per night additional. If you're leaving very early the next morning, you can save a few $ by paying right at the parking spots. Otherwise, pay the $26 at the hotel. Room was great, all in working order. Bed not the best ever, but did the job. We will be staying here again, without doubt. </DOC> The hotel is in a very good position and the staff is friendly. Rooms are ok in size, with all the comforts and amenities, but specially for clients that are sensitive to light I suggest not to ask for rooms on the 8th floor as they all have a skylight that is not completely blinded. Breakfast is ok either on the 5th floor where there is also a swimming pool, or at Starbucks on the ground floor. During our stay we had a fire alarm at 1.30am and even tough it was rather unusual (my first experience of such situation) I have to compliment myself with the staff and the fire department as they handled the situation in a very professional manner. Luckily it was a false alarm! </DOC> This hotel is located as far south as you can go in Toronto which makes it great for walking along the lake and taking in activities at Harbourfront and the Rogers Centre. The rooms are large and clean and the staff are very pleasant and professional. Because the hotel is a little south of the main attractions, you'll have to walk under a highway or take a streetcar to get to most attractions, but being close to the water is a pretty great compensation. </DOC> Wow! I can't say enough about this place. I'm a loyal Starwood member but needed to stay at the Radisson for budget reasons on my work trip. I was AMAZED. The staff was extremely friendly and the room was unbelievable. First, it was huge. Second, it had wrap around windows and a fireplace! There was also a beautiful sitting area and a spacious bathroom. This hotel was also centrally located and easy to get to everything. Did I mention there is a starbucks in the lobby? I don't think I've stayed in a Radisson in my life and while I was there I signed up for their loyalty program because I will certainly be back!",

Breakfast as usual excellent with plenty of choice with full cooked English breakfast, hotel quite busy but plenty of staff on hand if needed. Staff go over and above. Been many times and already booked to return 5*. </DOC> We were attending a wedding here so we booked a room. The hotel is very nice, Danielle checked us in she was lovely and friendly in comparison to the one who booked us out this morning...totally miserable and rude. I found the hotel to be quite cold in many of the areas. Our room was 29 it was nice enough and was quiet. The breakfast was lovely this morning but we turned up at 6.45 after calling reception only to find it was 7.30 of a weekend. It was all very good quality and a good choice of options. I think more staff are needed on the bar areas such as the restraunt bar as it was people queuing in a long line and the bar full of dirty glasses as they could not catch up.on them selves. </DOC> Pleasant stay here and it was fully booked which indicates it's obviously a popular place. We ate in the hotel and food was reasonably priced and portion sizes not too large. Service was friendly and helpful. The hotel offers zoo tickets at a discount with fast track so you get straight in. Bedrooms are comfortable and air conned. Will return. </DOC> This is a nice Hotel in its own grounds.DoubleTree has invested a lot to upgrade the rooms with white TV's and Air Cond. There is also a very popular fitness centre which making parking differ cult. I had dinner in Marco's my 3 course set meal was great value. It is much better than a Premier Inn which another reviewer mentioned </DOC> We were going to Chester races & stayed here on a Friday night. Convenient for the motorway, lots of secure, free car parking. Rooms were spacious, with comfy bed & good quality shower. Good quality breakfast in the morning before we headed home. All good here! </DOC> I choose the hotel for the location as it was close to where I was working but the stay at the hotel made the whole trip really enjoyable. Staff and Facilities were really flawless and I can't wait to come back and stay again. </DOC> Stayed here back in April due to a poor previous stay. This time was much better and the service was back to its usual self. Staff was friendly and helpful and the food in the restaurant was quick and very nice. The new part of the hotel is nice and very modern, as well as very bright and clean. Room was large and had a lovely seating area but with a detriment to the bathroom which was very small with just enough room for a shower. Got very noisy when other guest went past, especially those with children. All in all a good hotel stay and we will probably be back! </DOC> Really enjoyed my 2 night stay here - very comfortable room, welcoming staff and great sleeps! So quiet! Feels like being out in the country but easy to find off the motorway and only 10 minute taxi into city centre. Good sized pool too.",

Only strange thing is that they try to charge you for using the Gym (Spa is understandable) which is a first for me at a Hilton. </DOC> We received the usual warm welcome and thanks for our loyalty as Gold members and a welcomed upgrade to a great family room. Well designed room. It was a real shame MPW restaurant was closed as that was why we booked. We really enjoyed a few hours in the spa facilities which are very good. Evening meal in the restaurant was just 'ok' I guess we were disappointed as this wasn't our plans. We slept very well indeed and breakfast was nice not quite the usual Hilton brand choice but nice all the same. The children missed the pancake machine and Nutella many have now . All in all a very nice hotel and pleasant stay thanks hope to come again to get that steak! </DOC> The hotel is set in pleasant grounds just off the M53. It is currently having major works but that did not impinge on our stay. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful. However we were very disappointed to be told that Marco Pierre White restaurant was not open during the nights of our stay, especially as we had previously telephoned to make a booking for two of the nights of our stay and the hotel's letter of welcome indicated that it was open on those nights. We had breakfast and dinner in the Garden Terrace. Whilst the breakfast was adequate the dinner menu and food were very disappointing. The service was slow and disarranged. Our bedroom was very quiet, clean and comfortable. </DOC> Stayed in roon 233 for 2 nights for chester races and cheshire oaks, good location for both. Overall a good stay, room quiet, garden room restaurant nice for breakfast and an evening meal...so why not 5 stars, only hotel with a pool where entrance to the pool was an added extra (poor), we were left standing to be sitted for beeakfast for a while when there were plenty of staff members around. </DOC> A fabulous find - peaceful in the Cheshire countryside, but minutes from the motorway and so handy for Chester Racecourse where I was speaking at a function. Beautiful grounds and perfect walled garden where I had a great wake up spell after breakfast with morning papers and coffee. Top room and a trendy swivelling TV which could face the bed or the sitting area. Slow service for a meal on the second evening, but resolved with good grade by the maitre'd. Charming staff with particular praise to Lily (of Latvia), a star manager of the near future, and Cristina from Moldova who checked us out. A great stay and we'll be back! </DOC> great hotel, we have stayed before, so I was hoping it would be as good as the last visit, It was not?? it was better!! We had an upgraded room, for 2 nights, eat in the Doubletree, and everything was perfect from check in to check out. The staff could not do enough for our family, so a great big thanks to then all, the Hotel,is in a great location, not far from the town, I would recommend getting a taxi to and fro, as parking can be difficult as bust times, Lots to see and do, dinner, as said was fantastic, and breakfast really good,all in why stay anywhere else, saunders family. happy new year </DOC> This hotel was chosen for proximity to Chester zoo, and it was ideal for us. Upgraded at last moment, when it was booked out by a party, and this made it even better. Comfortable beds, everything clean and felt very new. Only negative (hence 4 stars) would be the very large size and consequence rather lacking of personal service. Staff though, very helpful in the main. Excellent breakfast buffet, with the exception that the hot food buffet was (as is often the case) a bit on the cold side. </DOC> This hotel is really lovely set in large gardens and very convenient for Chester and the retail outlets including the second largest Marks and Spencer in the UK. The staff are amazing and the food was good especially breakfast . We were very disappointed that the bar was shut in the evening due to a function and the restaurant was not open until six pm and seemed disorganized at the restaurant bar before that . We resorted to room service which was well over an hour in arriving and very disappointing. This hotel charges a relevant rate and you would expect the advertised facilities to be available accordingly . Should we consider a return visit it would be after checking with the hotel . .",

The breakfast was really good and the coffee machine made a nice cappuccino. The spa facilities were very good the pool area was lovely the outdoor heated whirlpool nice and hot and the steam rooms lovely. Staff were friendly. </DOC> My husband and I had spent the day at Chester Zoo and had booked in to the Double Tree for Afternoon Tea. We arrived early and were advised it would be at least half an hour before we could be seated, so we had a drink and sat in the outside area which is very peaceful and a great place to relax. After an hour, we were called for afternoon tea, (we were actually the only people having this) the cakes and sandwiches were fresh and plentiful. The tea, seemed very weak and took more than one tea bag in the teapot to get it to the correct strength. It was PG tips tea and if I am being honest I would have expected a better brand of tea for such a standard of hotel. All in all, It was a lovely afternoon and ideal for what we wanted. </DOC> Stayed for just one night. Did not use restaurant or leisure facilities. The room was extremely comfortable. Large bed, immaculate bathroom, large flat screen TV with ample channel choice, good WIFI. Had a problem with remote which was dealt with immediately. Breakfast was buffet style - loads of choice and staff outnumbered guests. Top nosh. Front line staff polite and professional. Booked through Bookings.com - found their central reservations tiresome - once you get through. </DOC> Attended a conference and stayed for one night at this hotel. It's a really nice hotel from the outside and was well maintained both inside and out. The room was very comfortable and any of the food I had was excellent. Really lovely garden outside too. Would definitely stay again! </DOC> Lowest score as my golden rule broken of not being welcomed as a Hilton Honors welcome but it got even worse at check in. Receptionist was all over the place, told me I was on room only so had to tell her I was HH gold so she didnt charge me for breakfast. Asked did we want dinner to be told restaurants full but see if we could be fitted in. Restaurant was empty no issues. Room very nice room 201 clean well presented. Dinner in Garden restaurant both nights excellent, restaurant staff lovely. Breakfast good but no observation of food levels dropping at buffet. Could so easily have had a 5 star review but blew it at check in. Stayed 5th to 7th October. My wife enjoyed the spa and treatments which she said was excellent. Check out staff different and far more alert. </DOC> Nice hotel, nice interior, pleasant breakfast The room was big, clean and had everything I needed I didn't eat at the hotel (as the reviews were bad). Instead I ate the nearby Toby Carvery Hoole Village (lovely meal for \u00a310) I didn't use the spa, as they wanted additional money for it. The only reason for the average rating was that I didn't sleep properly. I don't know if it was the bed, the temperature in the room, or just me... </DOC> We spent three nights at this hotel whilst visiting Chester. Our room was very spacious, with a large & comfortable king bed, a lounge area and a good sized bathroom with both a bath and shower stall. We chose to take breakfast in our room and this was promptly delivered at the requested time each day. We used the restaurant on our final evening and enjoyed a good meal, nicely prepared and presented. All the staff were friendly, helpful and efficient and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay., </DOC> This is really a very nice hotel in a lovely setting. It is fresh and modern and the staff at check in were very good. Room was comfortable with air conditioning and a large comfy bed. Benefits from a Spa and Marco Pierre White Steakhouse so all good so far. Could not get into the steakhouse so went to the Garden Room instead. Sat beside the bar to enjoy a drink before dinner and the bar staff were constantly throwing bottles into the bottle bin as enthusiastically as they could and generating as much noise as they could. It became unbearable as every bottle throw in clattered against the others. My nerves were shot to the point where I had to go over and complain. This helped but did not stop the problem entirely. Had a nice meal in the restaurant in a table far away from the bar. Tiger prawn salad was very good as was the cobb salad.",

Modern bar and lounge areas and a nice breakfast included in a smallish area. Beds very comfy and new looking and housekeeping didn\u2019t disturb us until 11.30 next morning which was nice to sleep our hangovers off. </DOC> I chose this hotel for the location and because I knew what to expect from the brand. The room was comfortable and excellent value at less than \u00a3130 for 2 nights. We were on the 4th floor with a partial view of the docks. The complimentary breakfast was adequate.

Brilliant absolutely brilliant....The room was just right and the breakfast was also superb.. Parking as previously mentioned was secure and under the hotel.\u00a313 for 24 hours which is happy days compared to anywhere in Manchester....

Forget the negative reviews this hotel is bang on. I will be back. </DOC> We only stayed the one night, which was a rewards night and really enjoyed our night, free WIFI and complementary buffet breakfast was a bonus and made our stay even more attractive. The hotel is about a five minute walk from Liverpool one shopping center and across the road from the Albert Dock complex. The hotel is clean and the rooms are also spotless and comfortable. The staff we had contact with was all friendly and greeted you with a smile. Breakfast was a bit busy and the food was self-service buffet, with plenty of choice.

Overhaul a very good stay and would definitely return when next home in Liverpool. </DOC> Excellent hotel situated just across the road from Albert Dock and Echo Arena . Hotel is clean and tidy and does a reasonable self service breakfast. The bar is well stocked but the staff at the bar could do with some additional training , not sure about various drinks and uncertain about prices and change . Not the barman\u2019s fault just I suspect to early to be left alone in what was a very busy bar / reception area. Saying all that would stay here again. Well worth a visit to the pub adjacent to the hotel as well for a great array of beers and gins </DOC> Great location across from the docks and exhibition centre, staff were pleasant and rooms to a good standard, very expensive room rate for what you get and breakfast was very poor quality. Sausages and bacon were tasteless, scrambled egg was dry, croissants were dry and tasteless, cheap breakfast food being used and for what you pay it should be better",

Christine you need to refine your customer service management skills, rude, dismissive, condescending are not skills any customer wants particularly when my business also use hilton group as preferred business hotel, I have every reason to change that - room preference on my guest profile \"rooms away from lifts\" guess where my room is !! Opposite the lift - 100% guarantee promise so far you are at 1% and not much hope of getting that improved, you should always treat your guests well as you never know what influence they have over business accounts !! </DOC> This place gets the price/location mix just right. Any closer to the docks would be more expensive, but it's close enough to enjoy everything on offer in the dockside area. I had a great stay here. Everything feels new and funky and the free breakfast was a welcome surprise. Room was modern and fresh with a very comfortable bed. Staff were universally lovely and helpful. Free left luggage facility and a great gin bar just outside! I was here for a gig in the Philarmonic Hall - taxi was only \u00a33 from this location.

The hotel is very conveniently located for the ACC and was the reason for choosing this hotel. the rooms are of decent size and sleep quality was good. Unfortunately there is no facility to put the bag - there is one table which can be used to rest your bag or use as an office desk. The breakfast lay out was pretty average. On both days the bacon and potatoes were cold and the sausage was just about warm. </DOC> i am not sure what I think, check in was rather slow, they insisted on a card print even though room was paid for and I had cash for extra's. The room was clean and comfortable as was bathroom. Toiletries were good. The breakfast was not the best, the scrambled egg sloppy and just did not look like real egg's! Although is pastries are your thing they had plenty. </DOC> Thoroughly enjoyed this hotel. The welcome was warm & sincere. The decor was very good. The rooms were spotlessly clean with all of today's requirements. The location was minutes walk from Liverpool 1 and the Albert Dock. A little tip. The pressure of business at breakfast can cause inconvenience. Choose your time carefully. The breakfast quality was very good and the wait for a table, cutlery & crockery didn't put us off.

In particular the young lady working reception and the bar last Saturday evening. She went above and beyond normal service levels. Also the other staff were all helpful, professional and made my stay as pleasant as possible. This hotel is better than many of the more expensive hotels I have stayed in and is not to be missed. I won\u2019t stay anywhere else in London now. </DOC> I stay in many Premier inn hotels and this is very typical. So well located near Victoria Station. Was here for a business trip for 3 nights and rooms were really quiet and bonus that they have air con. Rooms were usual premier inn standard. Although more dated style than the modern black wood. Staff were so friendly just a shame we had to hunt for someone to serve us in the bar. Prices were cheap for the room, bar and restaurant. Recommended if you are looking for something in the capital. </DOC> Checking in online was easy and when I arrived it was just add in my surname and the room number and key popped out: so quick and easy. The room on the third floor was big and so quiet and we slept very well. No noise from outside or inside. Great location just around the corner from Victoria station overland as well as tube. Would be my recommended hotel for London. Wifi was fast and free and didn't need the premium speed wifi. </DOC> Good simple traditional hotel. Fair prices and helpful staff. Great breakfast! Quiet area even on the ground floor. Breakfast can get chaotic in busy times but the staff do a great job of keeping it flowing. Room 117 is a great size and thought of as the best in the hotel. </DOC> Very convenient position close to Victoria Station. Easy walking distance to Buckingham Palace. Rooms are pretty standard for Premier Inn. Staff very friendly and helpful. Food was OK in the Thyme restaurant. Steak was very good. Breakfast OK but always better if cooked to order rather than buffet. </DOC> Does what it says on the tin - very slick operation. Well thought out rooms with very comfortable bed,air con , good size towels, extra pillows. We were on top floor and had one of our best nights sleep in London and we have stayed in many swanky establishments. Great location Internet was hopeless - maybe deliberate to get you to upgrade ???",

        "docs": "Fab location a couple of mins walk from Victoria train / coach stations and 10 mins walk from Buckingham palace. Decent size rooms - fairly comfortable standard, just as you would expect for a Premier inn. Very quiet and heard no noise from other rooms or outside (despite being next to the lift shaft). Staff extremely helpful and decent selection at breakfast. Would happily return. </DOC> For a short stay in London arriving and departing from Victoria Coach station I searched for a conveniently located and moderately priced hotel. This location met the requirements. We arrived early and they offered us luggage storage so that we could begin our day. Several restaurants nearby on Wilton Road as well as a large Sainsbury grocery store with fresh fruit and a decent selection of wine. The room was reasonably large and comfortable with a modern bathroom. The only downside was the free internet. It would drop out about once per five minutes requiring a quick refresh. This was just a bit irritating when reading email but it made any other task, like writing this review, basically impossible. I needed to wait for my next location to submit this review. Perhaps they are just trying to get you to pay for enhanced internet. That said, if you are only a casual internet user then this hotel will be quite good. </DOC> Our second time at this hotel. VERY conveniently located to Victoria Station, restaurants, supermarkets etc. Beds are very comfortable, excellent pillows, excellent linen, outstanding service, great value and quality breakfast. Although the rooms are ultra small and do seem to get smaller the longer your stay is (we stayed for 6 nights on this occasion and will likely look elsewhere next time we head to London. We were able to connect our laptop to the TV via HDMI which I wish more hotels would enable their guests to do. No fitness centre however there is a Fitness First near Victoria Station that allow casual users. Very handy location if it's your first trip to London. </DOC> Booked this hotel as we often stay in Premier Inn\u2019s and they normally address if there are any issues. Massive hotel. Booked in advance (March) with the flexible rate which was around \u00a3160 so not cheap. Room was cheaper 8-10 weeks before going so re-booked another room and cancelled original. Room pretty small, more of a double room than a family. 1 double bed, 1 single and a rollaway bed. Rollaway beds no good for older teens!!!! Seems like they try to squeeze a family into a double room to attract more. Breakfast good, restaurant quite small. Didn\u2019t have much for vegan\u2019s but the waitress was helpful and checked all the ingredients on certain products. Disappointed for the price we paid. </DOC> I thought this was an usual chain hotel. But in reality this Premier Inn was an excellent budget option in Central London. Conveniently located (just a few min walk from Victoria Station), it offered a clean room with a comfortable bed. I did not hear any excessive noise during my stay, although my room was next to the internal door. Of course, this was not a 5-star hotel - yet I got everything I needed for my overnight stay. The staff members were friendly and attentive. </DOC> Standard Premier Inn room but a bit on the small side which is common for most budget hotels in London. The hotel is centrally situated close to many London landmarks and attractions and round the corner from Victoria Station. The staff are mainly foreign but all speak good English. The foreign languages they speak maybe of use to overseas guests. Breakfast was the usual all you can eat Premier Inn but was well cooked and presented. The restaurant was a Thyme restaurant serving many pub classics which will be familiar to regular Premier Inn guests. Ideal for a business or leisure stay. </DOC> Let me start by saying how excellent the staff at this hotel are they really couldn't do enough for me and my family and they're without doubt a real asset to this hotel. Next up the hotel itself, small hot rooms and tired...very tired basically in need of investment but being in London I guess they get away with it. Having gone to sleep at 22:00 we (and the children) were Woking by the loud noises from the plumbing as the pipes vibrated at 22:30 and onwards until midnight. The problems were so great that whilst having my own shower the whole bath vibrated. I stay at Premier Inns all the time but not a chance I'll return here until it's refitted. </DOC> Only 150m from Victoria station so very convenient. Great breakfast, friendly staff and a good bar area. We had room 217 which was a very good family room, easily enough for 2 adults and 2 children without being cramped. Good shower as well. Also good storage for your bags if you want to spend the day out. Well recommended",

It was fully equipped, but everything is competing for space in the room. Finding enough place to setup the iron board is a challenge for example. But that being sad the prevailing feeling is cozy not claustrophobic. The hotel is locates right next to warren street tube station. There's two pret a mangers nearby for a quick cheap breakfast on the go. Ideal for the business traveller. I'll be back here. </DOC> I have stayed at this hotel before and had a room overlooking Tottenham Court Road. This time I requested a room at the back, so that I could sleep! This was fine as it was sufficiently far from the noisy front. Colleagues in front-facing rooms had a poorer night. My room was small, but had everything I needed and a very comfy bed. Wathc out for undeclared service charges when you get a drink from the bar! I have reviewed the hotel's restaurant (Steak and Lobster, Warren St) separately. </DOC> We stayed 1 night in a deluxe room. The room was very spacious and comfortable. It was on the top floor, so we did not suffer too much from noise, however we did hear ambulances leaving the nearby hospital. The only issue with the room was noisy air conditioning. Breakfast was very good, with a good choice of hot and cold items. Service of coffee was a little slow, but as we were having a lazy morning this was not a problem. Check-in staff were friendly and efficient. Would definitely stay here again. </DOC> I checked in early and this was no problem. Very friendly and helpful reception staff. Room small but clean and well appointed. Location at end of Tottenham Court Road a bit out for me. I recommend this hotel. </DOC> Fine hotel, like I am used to from the Radisson Blu Edwardian family of hotels. Clean rooms, silent environment, friendly and very helpful staff made my visit with my wife here a success, and something to do again :-). </DOC> Just one night stay at the Grafton which was fine. Great value for a London hotel and well located next to bus stops and the underground. Short walk to Covent Garden and the theatres. Excellent welcome at reception and the room was spotless and a very comfortable bed. All the usual facilities were good. </DOC> This hotel has rooms at very different prices. My single room was clean and with a well furbished bathroom, though small. Fairly good value for the area, right next to Warren Street tube. Room was quiet on 4th floor. You can check in, choose you room and check out on line. The technology works. The TV in the room is rather clunky to use. Plenty of plug points. Breakfast was really good. Service attentive. Mainly buffet with a few items a la Carte. Fresh juices, various milks and reasonable hot buffet choices as well as smoked salmon and meats and cheeses. The hotel is the usual Radisson Blu standard, with a great location. My basic single room was good value at just under \u00a3200 for B and B. </DOC> This was my first experience to arrive at check in (@ 17:20) to be told there were no double rooms left, despite having a confirmed pre-paid room. They proposed to move my to any Radisson Hotel a \"10 minute\" taxi away. After declining this i was given a small twin room. The room was small but did have a reasonable en-suite bathroom. Breakfast wasn't the best, only streaky bacon and no choice of eggs (only scrambled) Definitely not worth the money and i won't stay here again",

I would recommend it for business trips. But not so much for leisure. </DOC> Were here for 2 nights, room adequate, quiet, clean and in good condition, great location at the top of Tottenham court road, 20 yds from Warren St. tube station (Northern line) Even free fruit and water in the room. Good experience at a reasonable price, well done. </DOC> I like this hotel for its god location, the tube next door and easy access to a number of London\u2019s train stations. Check in and out are always quick and efficient. The only down side is the rooms are small and cane sometimes be a bit noisy if you are straight on to Tottenham Court Road. </DOC> The hotel is well situated, almost adjacent to Warren Street tube station. It is clean and upmarket. Our room was on the small side, but no doubt this is to be expected in Central London, and the prices compare favourably with other nearby hotels. There was desk space, with ample power points. We thought breakfast was somewhat pricey at \u00a320 per head, particularly since we don\u2019t eat large breakfasts, so the best solution was to pop out to the nearby Caffe Nero. Euston Station is only about 10 minutes\u2019 walk away. </DOC> This has become our regular hotel for our weekend theatre jaunts from Manchester. It's a lovely hotel in a great location. The staff are always very helpful and the breakfast is worth every penny. We look forward to staying there again soon </DOC> Had a two night stay here with friends. The entrance is extremely close to the exit of Warren Street Tube. Extravagant reception area gives a great first impression and the reception staff were all very friendly, welcoming and helpful. My twin room was on the first floor. A large, nice room, clean and modern bathroom. No view whatsoever, but then we weren't there to stay in the hotel all day. The hotel is deceptively large. It has a large area for breakfast and this leads to a wine/cocktail bar. The breakfasts are great. Plenty of choice, healthy and not so... </DOC> Great hotel in excellent area. Lots of pubs and shops around. VERY close to tube station (Warren Street) with two Tube lines (Northern and Victoria). Room was great (I got an upgrade because it was an Expedia VIP hotel). Large and very comfy. Bathroom was a good size, though the sink was small and the toilet was way too close to the sink. Other than that, everything was ideal. Ice maker right by elevators. And, most of all, CLEAN! Staff were great. Very accommodating and polite.",

Meeting rooms were good but a bit on the cold side and no windows. Otherwise very good overall </DOC> Stayed one night on business solely because of the location.

The staff at reception are both welcoming and helpful and understood my request for a quiet room. The room I was given was on the ground floor, and was very comfortable and I had a good night's rest. The air conditioning controls are a bit dated, though, and the air conditioning itself could be better, but I still managed to sleep. I didn't dine in the hotel or even order a drink, so can't comment on the catering, but the room was comfortable. </DOC> The Double Tree is perfected located in central London to suit business and personal needs. Rooms are relatively large, clean and have good amenities - the bed was comfortable, and there was little noise from the street outside. Staff were friendly and helpful throughout my stay, the breakfast on offer was good quality and had a wide variety of options and the gym was large, offering a number of cardio machines and weights by hotel standards. Price is average for London standards - the hotel is an excellent option and one I will certainly consider again when in London again. </DOC> There's nothing more I need than a hot shower after long travels, and to have a property as respected as Doubletree not have this is beyond my understanding. Room 243 had no water pressure and was cold. I highly recommend testing your shower before unpacking so you can request a working shower. On the second night, I got a different room. Otherwise, wifi worked fine, food is fine at restaurant, and they kindly packed an early morning breakfast for us as we needed to leave early. </DOC> Over the course of a 2 weeks in London I stayed in four separate hotels, three in London: The Royal Horse Guards, Grosvenor House, and the DoubleTree in the West End. The DoubleTree, close to the British Museum, the Underground, and walkable to most of London is a good option for visiting the city. The hotel is not pretentious, which I liked, our room was ready early (not something that can be counted on in London in the summer, and the breakfast was decent. Our room was fairly small, but rooms in London can vary dramatically - even within hotels. This hotel often offers very competitive rates, before spending twice a much elsewhere in central London it is certainly worth a look. </DOC> This was a really average overnight stay in a mediocre hotel back in January 2016. I only chose this following the recommendation of the people I came to meet on a business trip to London, because it was near the offices I would visit. I wish I had chosen otherwise. The room was adequate in size but in need of a renovation. I didn't mind a one-night sleep but I would hesitate to book this for longer. Breakfast was a bad experience, as the personnel appeared to be overanxious not to let anyone who hadn't paid for it (?) have breakfast, they rudely asked about it and then did not concern themselves with the guests other than to remove their plates. On the other hand the price for the hotel was fair for the centre of London, so I guess one shouldn't complain too much. </DOC> Stayed for 1 night. Check in was very friendly and got into room quickly, was upgraded to a family room which was larger at rear of hotel. Found it comfortable and good ventilation from open-able windows in room and bathroom and was nice and quiet. Went for a drink before heading out for dinner and staff were a bit useless and didn't find them very friendly but surroundings were comfortable and relaxing. Slept well and next day breakfast was the normal fayre and was adequate although wasn't keen on the underground restaurant level. Stairs was also very small but this would be due to the style of old buildings its located in, Overall good may return again at the right price. </DOC> Older property with nice size room, adequate for a business trip. Hotel service is also very good and the bar downstairs offers a nice meeting place. The rooms are pretty basic. The bathroom can use towel rods. Other then that nothing special but quite adequate. </DOC> We were bought, as a gift, tea at the Doubletree (Hilton). The staff were sweet, but the quality of the tea was really disappointing. Poor selection of teas, poor quality sandwiches, small scones, and over sweet small cakes. The place has no atmosphere at all. There are much better venues in London",

View of scaffolding out of the window - zero daylight. That said, good bed, slept well. Quiet. Okay for one night at the price. Had it been more expensive, I'd been here longer, or travelling for a special occasion, I'd not have been happy. Sure - bury the worst room in the house on those of us with discounted rates if you like - but based on that, I'm never coming back! </DOC> Booked a twin room and it was perfect for our needs. Small rooms but for a night or two, it works. Walking distance from Covent Garden and Soho. Super friendly and professional staff. Overall, we'd definitely come back! </DOC> Booked a room for a Friday night. I arrived around 7, and there was no wait for check-in. The staff member that checked me in was a trainee, and was professional and friendly. The room was round the back of the hotel, and was large, comfortable and - essentially - quiet. I had a good night's rest and checked out the next day refreshed. On a separate note, I ordered the burger from the room service menu, and - while not good restaurant quality - was perfectly acceptable, and was hot when it got to me. </DOC> Run down and dilapidated. First night rooms had table top AC where the window had to be kept open to a roof deck with dirty rocks and central AC vents, so that the table top AC heat discharger could vent. The \u201cJr. Suite\u201d for the following nights was smaller than most standard hotel rooms and was underground. The bathroom for 3 was tiny and with one sink. The pull out couch\u2019s mattress was so thin that you sank into the coils on the bed frame. Motel 6 would be an upgrade. </DOC> Very friendly reception staff - I had a minor issue with my room which was dealt with immediately, efficiently and without fuss. they apologies profusely even though it was a trivial matter. Hotel well located between Russell Square and Holborn underground stations and less than 15 minutes easy walk from Covent Garden. Plenty of bars, restaurants and other attractions close by. Room was small, but comfortable and clean. Good free wifi. The only negative was the positioning of the soap tray and grab handle in the shower - positioned such that it intrudes on the space available. </DOC> Upon checking in we were greeted warmly and thanked for our loyalty (gold HHonors members) and it was realised we had made an error in booking but the lovely gentlemen at the desk was very pleasant indeed and we received the upgrade As a family the 2 bedroom family apartment was extremely comfortable and I imagine the kitchen area would be excellent for families of longer stays. There is no longer an executive lounge here but the gym is fair. Room service wine was very slow is the only negative I could find. The bar was cosy and enjoyable. Breakfast was very nice with reserved HHonors seating the usual fantastic Hilton choice Excellent location with varied restaurants on the doorstep and a 15 minute walk to Covent Garden and the theatres Thank you for the great service </DOC> the rooms were tiny. a single bed that is maybe less than a meter in wide, stuck to the wall from one side.. just horribly small room hotel had a small area for a bar at the ground level. location is not prime considering other locations in London - and with that was not a cheap hotel. </DOC> I normally stay at The Doubletree Angel for my regular business trips as it's closer to my office. As an alternative I tried here. Great position close to Russel Sq with efficient and professional check in. The room was an upgrade to a superior and was big (I think it was 2 original small rooms converted to one - 2 windows and an area big enough for a sofa but only a desk and a chair instead). Large TV and a fridge in the room with an iron and board in the wardrobe. The bathroom was a little odd with a window that was large and not frosted (clear glass!) with a net curtain. Although I was on the 6th floor and not really overlooked, I still felt a little exposed and showered in the dark! I'd use the hotel again without question, however the Angel is more convenient for me from a location point of view.",

There are two plus points for this hotel - it is very convenient for the British Museum and I liked the entrance and bar area. One other thing was ok - the buffet breakfast. The rest however was average at best. We had a \"deluxe double room\" which turned out to be a medium to small L-shaped cupboard. The bathroom was a good size but they did not put any cups or glasses in it for tooth cleaning. The bed was probably a standard size but seemed small to me and at \u00a3300 per night I had expected much better. </DOC> For \u00a3100 a night I might have been content, but I paid about \u00a3160 and the room was really small with a single bed. I'd go back, but only if the room size vs. cost was reasonable. You can do better for the money in my opinion. </DOC> I recently stayed at this hotel for a business trip to London. The hotel is 5 mins away from Holborn station which is on the main Piccadilly line of the tube station in London. This means that you can get anywhere you wish quick. The hotel itself was to a very high standard. It was modern and elegant in the foyer and bar area on arrival, which gives a good impression. The staff are excellent on arrival, no issues at all. They all make you feel welcome & comfortable. The room I stayed in was excellent, I am unsure if its bigger than standard as I am a Hilton Honors member. For London it could be classed as a mansion. Bed was comfy & bathroom was nice. I am scheduled to stay at this hotel again with my wife for my birthday, this is the best recommendation I can give. </DOC> Nice enough hotel undergoing some refurb and remodeling work. Functional room. And very comfy bed only stayed for 1 night but the room did the job so cant complain. Hotel felt a bit like a maze to get around. But all in all a good stay. </DOC> Enjoyed a great stay at this hotel. It started with a very warm and welcoming greeting at the reception desk which included the provision of of two free cookies. Very efficiently processed and we were in our room within a few minutes of arriving. Room and bed was clean, comfortable and quiet ( with the Air Con off !), albeit of the usual London dimensions which may or may not come as a surprise to some of our US visitors. Great that we were able to open the windows at night and could hear very little external noise.

Very easy walking distance for London shows, Covent Garden, British Museum, and numerous restaurants.

Didnt try breakfast- lots of cafes close by. </DOC> A well-located hotel with easily accessible transport links to most of London. Our one night stay was perfectly OK.

Hotel is modern and looks recently refusrbished. Room was comfortable but a little noisy as I faced a busy road.

In most other regards, however, the hotel is distinctly average. As we were not planning to spend more time than necessary in our room, we just booked a standard Double and it was just as well we did not stay very long as the room was very small with one side of the double being virtually against the wall. The room was also noisy very early each morning as the housekeepers had a storage cupboard very close to the room and were not at all quiet about going about their business. On the whole, the staff we dealt with were very friendly and efficient so on the whole we had an adequate but average stay. </DOC> Staff were excellent, from checking in to breakfast staff. Helpful and friendly. I asked for and was provided with a quiet room at the back of the hotel. The room was tiny (bed up against a wall which I hadn\u2019t had since I was a kid ;o) ) The mattress springs were soft with little support. Pillows were comfy. Shower was weak. Breakfast was very basic, everything dairy was \u201clow fat\u201d which means high in sugar, which isn\u2019t good for fat people or diabetics. They should have more choice. I wouldn\u2019t rush back. </DOC> Stayed for 2 nights - the hotel is on the midst of a refurb, my room was fine - but the room aircon was replaced by huge noisy unit.

There is also a grocery store across the street. The rooms were small compared to a Double Tree in the US, we did not mind. The best part about this hotel is that it is on the picadilly line that takes you to Heathtrow airport. We missed the free breakfast as we had to leave early for the airport. I would stay here again. </DOC> The online portrait of this hotel does not really let you know how small the rooms are. Not the worst thing in the world but it is interesting that the room was about the same size as the bathroom! The internet is really fast but you have to join a cloud service to access the WiFi which is a pain. The staff is very helpful and the bar in the lobby comfortable and offers a good selection of wines for a reasonable price. Then there is the cookie at check-in! Happy to see that some traditions make it across the pond! </DOC> First stay in this part of town. Most hotels around here don\u2019t look great so I chose based on the brand I trust. This was a good move. Away from the hustle of Southampton Row the welcome was good and check in efficient. A good room on the inside - chosen well to avoid the road noise. Will use this again.",

        "docs": "Stayed here on business for one night in a double room. All standard DoubleTree characteristics & staff very friendly. Was impressed at the size of the room - by no means large, but most London hotels are very cupboard like, yet there was plenty room to move around and the bathroom was huge! </DOC> Great hotel and central to everything. But our first room had a bed that would kill an old dog. We asked for a change and the friendly staff got us into a better, bigger room (same standard) and a much better bed. It might pay to check the room when you check-in as the rooms seem to vary. We were on the 3rd floor first, but the better room was on the 5th floor (502) facing the street, very nice. Only 1 of 3 lifts were operational, which was a pain in the behind, but didn't really cause too much grief. </DOC> This was an unexpected stay following a 2.5 hour delay on Eurostar. I could not believe that I landed a room for \u00a392 in London booked at 11pm on a Friday night, let alone that I was upgraded to a premium deluxe room on arrival 30 minutes later. The room was extremely comfortable, albeit in a basement looking out onto a brick wall, but more than compensated by the quality of the room. Moreover the breakfast (full cooked courtesy of gold status) was very good with an unusually large range of cooked options including well seasoned, soft scrambled eggs. Next time I need to stay in London, this Doubletree will be at the top of my list of hotels to look up. </DOC> It's a while since I last visited and it was good then and has improved still further. Great service is at the heart of what they do. Remembering a drink order for a group; giving a new cup of coffee when it's gone cool and needs refreshing and the new Honors area for breakfast plus fresh omelet facility were great. Plus 204 - is a fabulous room - well done guys! I'll be back! </DOC> This hotel was The Bonnington and has stood on this site for over 100 years, Hilton took over some nine years ago and branded it as one of its mid range Doubletree sites. It was given something of a face lift and is now a perfectly decent central London hotel, nothing particularly special. The rooms are large and very comfortable, everything works as it should but it is now in need of some more updating and is a little tired. But at \u00a3170 per room per night the price is very reasonable for its location, whilst not exactly central West End, it is right next to the British Museum. </DOC> The room was so small that the standard double bed was pushed up against the wall. The view was of scaffolding outside the window. The breakfast was average at best. Coffee horrible. We were too tired after a full-on day in town that we didn\u2019t bother to complain. This is the second (and last) time we\u2019ve had a poor quality room at a Hilton. I\u2019ve stayed in better quality, less expensive rooms than this in London. </DOC> We stayed here for a couple of nights for a short city break in London. The hotel is ideally placed in Bloomsbury, a short walk into the West End and an equally short walk to Kings Cross for trains back up North. Rooms were small, as you get used to in the centre of London, but nicely furnished with everything you need. Staff were very helpful. </DOC> Stayed here for two nights whilst visiting London. Prefer it to the Westminster hotel as closer to the action. Asked to check-in early and was looked after by the excellent reception team. Premium, deluxe room was ok (not sure what was premium or deluxe about it!) Would possibly stay again but there are better choices available.",

Very close to Oxford street with a lot of shops and near the marble arch from where we took the London big bus tour. Used the hotel concierge transportation from the airport and likely overpaid but it was fantastic to be met at the airport and delivered directly to the hotel with a bit of local commentary along the way. The regency club was darling! We weren't around for evening canap\u00e9s but the breakfast and afternoon snack was delightful. Would definitely stay again. </DOC> We visited London for a show in Hyde Park and the location of this hotel could not have been better. The underground is very close for destinations that are not within a quick walk from this hotel. The rooms and halls are very modern and clean. We were very pleased with the size of our room. </DOC> Stayed for two days - great location for Oxford St and Marylebone Village. Interiors are OK but though staff were very friendly and helpful. Not luxury by London standards but good for business and shopping needs in the West End. </DOC> The hotel was beautiful, the location outstanding, the facilities great. But the people who worked there were fantastic and enhanced the experience. Principally the people at valet, concierge, and Claudia in the bar. Overall this was a great experience and I fully intend to return. BTW: even though it was 22 pounds, the continental breakfast was filling and a lot and just what I needed when trying to shake off jetlag and prepare for a public speaking engagement. </DOC> Churchill Hyatt We have stayed in a few Hyatt hotels over the world and can say that the hotel chain just seems to get it right. Rooms comfortable and well equipped. We had a room in the Regency Club so enjoyed pre theatre drinks and snacks. Breakfast was also in the clubroom and there was a good choice even for vegetarians! Nice and quiet throughout the night. Very close to the shops on Oxford Street or you can stroll around Hyde Park. Staff were very pleasant and helpful. </DOC> I was back at this hotel for a couple of days and was impressed by the renovations. ( See May 2017 for my initial review). I was unable to get a larger room however I was given a newly renovated one. The room was average size, a king size bed, a desk, and a chair. The bathroom was small but I appreciated the stand up shower versus the tub because it felt more spacious. They did not have a Nespresso machine however they had all the other amenities. The lobby area was spacious and ideal for hanging out with friends and having an afternoon tea. Their gluten free items were limited and they even ran out of gluten free bread at some point. Breakfast buffet was good, plenty of options, again low on gluten. Overall, this is a great hotel with proximity to Oxford street and high end shopping. I give it my GoldnAdvice seal of approval. </DOC> For a chain hotel it is very well run and very efficient on check in and check out with all done electronically ( apart from picking up and dropping off key!) the rooms are lovely and for London it is great that they have some rooms with balconies. The outside terrace is fantastic and overall service is friendly and efficient including room service",

I have stayed here before would defintely stay here again. Breakfast was marvelous. Great variety of different choices. The concierge, who was of Indian descent, gave me a great tip on an Indian restaurant. Best Indian food I\u2019ve ever had. You can\u2019t go wrong staying here. </DOC> The rooms are a bit tired and the place needs a refurb. The black and grey decor is a bit drab and tatty in some places. The breakfast in the executive restaurant was mediocre and the supply of food to the buffet area was poor. We had to keep asking for things to be replenished. The ambience and atmosphere in the bar at night was very good and the location was very convenient for Oxford Street. However the pluses do not outweigh the minuses and even though we have stayed a few times over the years we will not go back. </DOC> The hotel is very elegant, perfectly situated for business as well as leisure travel, and even the simplest room is of a decent size, for a relatively fair price... We have to bear in mind that this is still London. The breakfast is very good, the restaurants on site are nice, and Regent Park, Oxford Street and Bond Street, as well as Marble Arch are all within a few minutes walk. </DOC> I spent 2 nights here when my onward travel arrangements fell through. I had one of the updated rooms and it was very pleasant and devoid of street noise, which is unusual in London; however, the hallway noise was pretty bad. When walking down the hall, you could here people talking in their rooms - like regular talking. The gym was okay with a lovely plate of fresh fruit and towels, but the only way to access it was down a fairly grungy stairway. The front desk staff was very friendly and efficient. The location is great for Oxford Street shopping. I was on vacation and woke up to drilling, so although renovations must happen, it's important to know before you book. </DOC> the bar is great! beautiful design, fantastic staff and of course an incredible cocktail menu. I don't have much to stay but to recommend as it's one of the few places that stays open quite late. (2am? 3am?) We really enjoyed ourselves and are sorry we stayed so late :) </DOC> Excellent stay here. Got the Satchi suite #806 for us. Modern deco with one and half bath. Standing shower in main bathroom. Mariana our housekeeping lady was the best I\u2019ve come across. She is an older lady and was happy to work even for the holiday season. Vicky in the lounge as well provided good service. He remembered me and my daughter from our previous stay here. Now that\u2019s something. Simone too was good at the 8th floor check in. The doormen here are amazing. Always friendly and happy to serve. Love this property. Location is excellent. Only negative is the mannerless Arabs. Never dined here at the Italian restaurant but have heard good things. </DOC> I stayed here twice. I really liked the hotel. The location is good and within walking distance of the underground. The Hyatt Regency club is very nice, but can be crowded. The rooms are of a typical Hyatt Regency standard and very good for London standards. Good Hyatt diamond recognition. Will definitely return. </DOC> We stayed at The Churchill after a friend's wedding there. The rooms are nice and relatively large by London standards. The common areas are charming and we'll decorated, the staff are helpful and polite, the location good and the wifi actually works! A minor problem is that there really aren't enough lifts for what is a very large hotel. Ultimately The Churchill is a solid choice in Central London but lacks any \"wow\" factor- something I view as essential at the price point they are targeting.",

Over the years we have stayed here many times, four times since January alone and usually for a week or longer at a time. It has become something of our London home, the club lounge makes it so and the club\u2019s staff are all wonderful. Other hotel s might or newer or swankier but I doubt any other hotel could perform so well so consistently. </DOC> A very good Hyatt property in central London with super service and great food. Oxford street is a block away and so are good restaurants such as Roka Mayfair etc. You can't go wrong with the hotel. I got to stay in their newly refurbished rooms!! Currently hotel is going through renovation which should be completed soon. </DOC> I chose this hotel because of its proximity to the Marble Arch and Oxford St. The hotel itself is quite nice with friendly, professional staff. I appreciated having 2 complimentary bottles of water in the room each day. We had the continental breakfast in the restaurant off of the lobby. Nice selection of pastries, fruits and juices. The coffee was bitter, but a little sugar and cream fixed that. </DOC> By London standards The Churchill is not overly expensive, by world standards The Churchill has excellent facilities, very nice Executive Lounge and impeccable staff service. One cannot expect much more. </DOC> Another wonderful stay and the Hyatt Churchill. The 8th floor rooms and the club lounge make for a peaceful stay. The perfect way to start and finish your day. Room spacious and bedding extremely comfortable. Very quiet. </DOC> We attended a charity dinner event here in the large ground floor function room. There must have been at least 200 guests but despite this challenging number the 4 course meal was superb quality and the service matched it with friendly, attentive service - well done to the function team. Beautiful venue too. We had a thoroughly enjoyable evening. </DOC> Location is good. The rooms and amenities are good as well despite standard rooms are tiny. Good service. There is very good cigar bar - The Churchill and one of the best London Italian restaurant - Locanda Locatelli. </DOC> We love the Churchill we having been staying here for well over a decade. It is one of our favorite hotels. We do feel the Regency Club food quality has gone down a bit and their wine selection not as good as other countries, but the service is great.",

The rooms are well appointed, with good quality furnishings and the bathroom is excellent At midnight we were headed out for a snack, the receptionist was able to get us something from the kitchen and bring it to us in the room. The service here is friendly but unstuffy. This hotel is highly recommended. </DOC> It was a great respite after a long, trans-Atlantic flight. We were quickly checked in, and they gave us a room an hour earlier than originally promised. The staff was always gracious and helpful, and quickly resolved any concerns we had. Our room was large, the bed quite comfortable, and the bathroom was large and very clean. An easy walk to Kings Cross Station, and convenient to area attractions via bus or metro. </DOC> Stayed for two nights as a family of four and there were works going on to introduce changes in retaturants at the ground floor, right about to be opened. However, we were given a refurbished room with a nice view of London and very comfortable beds. The service at breakfast was a bit under the level one would expect at a 4-star rated hotel: no explanation how would it be possible not to have espresso coffee on offer as the machine was \u00abbroken\u00bb... the choice was below expectations either in fruits, bread selection etc. But was just \u00abok\u00bb at a minimum let's say. Would benefit from some improvements here and perhaps when the works are finalised the service will also be better. </DOC> We stayed there once in sept/Oct,2018 for five weeks and then again in January,2019 for three days. It was a very convenient location for us. The hotel is nice, clean. The lobby is spacious and attractive. Rooms are well appointed and bathrooms are suitably equipped with amenities etc. The staff were very friendly and cordial. Enjoyed our trip. </DOC> Having dinner with a friend in central London we chose the hotel as it was close to st pancras, it was only a 5 min taxi ride to the station and the twin room we had was nice, with two large beds, and all amenities including a nice bathroom. Staff were very friendly a good place to stay and competitively priced compared to other hotels in the area. </DOC> We stayed on points at this hotel for the first time this weekend. The hotel is a 20 min walk from Euston. It's also 20 mins or so from the Thames. It's quite well situated. The rooms are super (we had an Exec room). The Exec lounge was lovely and the breakfast fantastic. The staff were great and looked after us well. </DOC> This is a decent Crowne Plaza, busy and somewhat congested seemingly all the time. We were well handled on check in, efficient and very polite- and quick! Multiple reception stations kept things moving along nicely. Our room was smallish but had a nice view and the hotel was very quiet. The restaurant does an excellent breakfast and again, was fast and flawless. It\u2019s a short walk to St Pancras and the hotel is situated in an interesting shop area. We would recommend this hotel for a short stay for those connecting at or needing access to these terminals. </DOC> I stayed 1 night here, great location as I traveled by eurostar train from Paris. Staff mostly friendly. Room was clean and comfortable. I felt safe. Area is nice. I liked the decoration. There is no complementary coffee or tea which wasnt good to me, London is cold these day, that would have highlighted my visit :) highly recommended.",

Room was excellent and service very good for breakfast and in the bar. Rooms clean, beds comfortable, modern and quiet. All mod cons too </DOC> This was my first time staying in this hotel, and the staff in the lobby were welcoming which matched the environment. The room was as expected from a Crowne Plaza. The restauarant was a pleasant surprose, with a Belgian themed restaurant and bar, which meant that there was a wide selection of Belgian Beers available on tap and draught. The staff were friendly and made me feel like one of the familiy. My only issue was the fact that a fault had developed with the hot water system in the hotel, which meant I could look forward to a bracing cold shower in the morning - bit of a disappointment really. Thankfully, when I raised my concerns with the hotel management, suitable recompense was made. I look forward to using this hotel in the future. I understand it has a gym and pool but I didnt get the change to try these out on this visit. </DOC> My wife Karen and I were down in London last week for a couple of nights and chose this hotel for location and ratings. We enjoyed a 2 nights package deal where we enjoyed a hearty tasty three course meal on the first night and a good breakfast on both mornings. Every single member of staff that we spoke with/to had a real positive \"can do\" attitude and were helpful, friendly and informative. This was our first proper visit for several years as we had just got sick and tired of going down from from Fife and frankly, being treated as \"foreigners in our own nation's capital\". Bravo all and especially the Concierge staff who were fantastic and in particular our new friend from Trinidad and Tobago! </DOC> 25 years after opening as a Holiday Inn in 1992, this busy hotel is due to be be re-flagged by the end of this month as a Crowne Plaza property, following an extensive refurbishment which has included re-modelling the public areas on the ground floor level to incorporate a branch of the Belgo chain of restaurants. (This space is also used for breakfast service). Rooms are comfortable, compact and well-equipped, and the location is certainly convenient - a short distance from Kings Cross Station, and with easy access via Gray's Inn Road to the Holborn/Chancery Lane business district. </DOC> We booked it for \u00a355 as a top secret hotel. V good value. Room was pretty central. Staff was extremely helpful. They gave us high floor room, but advised us on noise as well due to refurbishment. V good facilities. \u00a33.50 is not much, but could have been part of the price. Overall, pretty happy with Holiday Inn. V good price value. </DOC> Good stay with family. Were given interconnecting rooms as requested and the hotel staff were uniformally friendly, efficient and professional. The rooms were slightly small but well decorated and comfortable. The pool area is good also, though a small fee has to be paid. Only Slight downside was that its not right on top of a tube, but even then only 10-15 min walk to King's X. </DOC> Luke warm greeting at reception. Concierge was distinctly displeased to see us. The hotel is no where near Kings Cross and is a very good walk away. Clean and tidy room but the sofa was made up as a bed which limited space. The hotel looked tired and a reminded me of a bad bed and breakfast from the 70's. Distinctly underwhelmed. </DOC> Modern and trendy looking hotel. Rooms are good and well appointed. Bar and restaurant has a range of seating and are attractive and stylish. Club lounge excellent with free drinks and buffet breakfast. Hotel staff great.

The staff were very good and friendly and the rooms very comfortable with adequate facilities. The rates are very good if you book well in advance for this part of London. Breakfast usual buffet fayre. The only thing that let the hotel down was that the lifts kept breaking down and on departure day we had to walk down 6 flights with luggage. Not so bad for us but there were elderly guests in hotel who just couldn\u2019t manage it. That said it\u2019s a superb location you can walk to Kensington food market and also to the V & A and Natural history museum. </DOC> I had read a few not so nice reviews but we are very happy! First, location. Beautiful location in Kensington, close both to Hyde Park, museums, shopping and restaurants. The hotel itself is wonderful. Outside - classic and stylish. Inside - very modern. We had a small but very nice hotel room. Looks like everything is new. The bathroom is of highest standard. The room smells fresh as well! The bed is....perfect. When it comes to service - the check in was smooth and nice. I was recognized as Hilton Gold Member, with room upgrade and free full english breakfast. I will check out tomorrow but I expect no problems ;-). The only thing - room service called us 03.00 in the morning..eh wrong number..I highly recommend this hotel!! </DOC> The only saving grace about this hotel is the staff remain professional and courteous whilst everything around them falls apart. The refurbishment is causing the whole place to be disjointed, tatty and just not what people expect of the Doubltree Brand. I was unsure if our room was being renovated whilst we we staying in it due to the half finished work everywhere which included flickering lights and stains running down the walls. On one evening walking back through the maze of narrow corridors there was water pouring out of a light fitting in the ceiling. The photos I\u2019ve attached are from our room, we reported this but it shouldn\u2019t be deemed acceptable to place people in rooms like this in the first place. We won\u2019t be rushing back! </DOC> One nights stay at the end of March. Location wise the hotel is great - we had tickets for a gig at the Albert Hall which was about 15 minutes walk and there were plenty of eateries around. About 5 mins walk to South Ken tube. My issue to be honest was the rooms. We had a complimentary upgrade but the room was small and pokey, tiny bathroom, half the toiletries were missing and the room was unbearably hot, even with the window open. Breakfast was in line with other Hiltons. </DOC> My wife and I stayed at the Doubletree Kensington New Years Eve. It was great value for money considering it was New Years Eve. The hotel is being renovated, but there was no work going on due to the holiday. We had a room on the 6th floor, it was clean and comfortable even if it was \u201ccompact\u201d! The staff were helpful and friendly, the hotel is a 4 min walk to the Circle Line tube, so access to central London was easy. Breakfast was a little limited but we got to the restaurant right at the end of service due to the late night, all in all a good stay and I hope to return when the renovations are complete. </DOC> The scaffold entrance sets the tone for this very mediocre Hilton offering in the heart of one of the world's greatest cities. The front desk staff are surly and uninterested and the staff of the restaurant/bar like the breakfast buffet are lukewarm. From the doorman watching you struggle with your cases on the doorstep to the newly renovated pokey rooms the entire and expensive experience is uninspiring and unexpected for the Hilton brand. I inadvertently left a sentimental article of clothing in the closet but 8 hours later it had disappeared. Promises made by arrogant desk staff to \"get back to me\" never happened. 3 weeks later a helpful customer service rep. confirmed the disappearance. As a HH Gold member I expected more. Perhaps the structural rejuvenation should extend also to the entire staff. A modest hotel with much to be modest about </DOC> Great location for the museums as well as bus and underground routes. Good air conditioned room but the shelf over the TV and dressing table had not been cleaned since it was built - I have never seen dust so thick (I saw it when I stood on a chair to adjust the air con vents)! Friendly, helpful staff but breakfast was a disaster both days I was there. The dining room is tiny so guests have to spill over into the bar after waiting 15-20 minutes to be seated. The buffet cannot cope with the numbers so there is always something missing. Yes, I like this hotel, but its management team needs to take a long hard look at what is happening here as it is going downhill. </DOC> I stayed there while was on business trip to London. I came to watch Chelsea game and chose this hotel due it location. It\u2019s 20 minutes by walk to the Stanford Bridge. Hotel room is small but well kept.",

The guy who checked me in wasn't very welcoming - no acknowledgement of my Diamond hhonors status, and worse still no signature DoubleTree cookie! Moving on from the reception experience, the hotel was having some construction work outside, so although I looked onto scaffolding, the room itself was clean, well decorated and appointed, and I had a good rest. Breakfast was also good, and the staff here attentive. I would recommend the hotel as it is easily accessible from the Piccadilly line underground, and worked well for my onward meetings in the City. Come on though DoubleTree Kensington - inspire and motivate your reception staff! </DOC> I had a very good stay here, 5 nights. Room modern, clean, quiet and cool (A/C worked well, quiet enough to leave on in the night) There is a long term refurbishment with building work but only done in the day, no disturbances. Upon initial check in was given a room without functioning A/C but upon complaining got a modern room. Would be better if they didn\u2019t try it on. Working fridge & 2 complimentary bottles of water, tea & coffee making facilities. Excellent location </DOC> Let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s a Doubletree, it may be transforming to a Curio, but now it\u2019 a Doubletree. Good location, normal ok rooms and breakfast is not bad (not great either, just ok), but did I mention that (even disregarding the fact that I am a hilton diamond member) I don\u2019t expect to pay a charge for my capuccino at breakfast. Ridiculous. I will not come back. </DOC> This hotel is having a serious makeover, cannot see from the outside for all the scaffolding. Warm reception as a Silver member and a nice new room 41, however the carpet was filthy with building type rubbish - needed to get cleaned before acceptable to sleep in the room. Dining room empty which was not a good sign, and food pretty average and not cheap. I would have expected more from a Hilton. </DOC> Friendly and helpful staff struggling through issues around the refurbishment. Short walk from Gloucester Road Underground station, so good access for getting around. Rooms are not large (but OK) and the corridors are dark and narrow. Breakfast is good. </DOC> The hotel does have a good location close to Soth Ken. tube and an easy walk to Knightsbridge, Kings Rd. etc. However, it a rather grubby hotel with tiny, unattractive rooms. As other reviewers have pointed out there is a lot of building work going on (Summer 2018), so until they have completed this I would not recommend. </DOC> So, I love this location in London. I was at this hotel 2 years ago and from March 24, 2019 hotel will be the part of Curio collection - 5 star hotels. Lobby and some rooms are still in progress of renovation. But!!! I love new Tiffany colors everywhere, new room style and reception area. Great job, guys, ho ahead! Fantastic hotel. Brilliant location. </DOC> When you book a DT, you do expect a decent hotel however this has got to be one of the worst. The only decent thing was the location. Central and a 5 min walk to the tube station. I checked in online the day before yet I couldn't get that room and they looked at me like I was talking nonsense. The room was decent size with a tiny bathroom. No fridge. No Air Con. On the wall but broken. We were left with a fan and a window that wouldn't stay open. Utter joke in this day and age. Not one staff member said hello or approached us during our stay. Not a friendly place at all. I doubt I will be back and would not recommend.",

        "docs": "Two nights in London staying at this hotel. Right across road from St Pancras so good to just arrive at station and quickly get to hotel. Check in quick and easy. Staff very friendly. Room very big for London. Bed very comfortable. Very quiet day and night so no issues sleeping. Room very clean and towels changed on day two. One small issue was the shower. 5 minutes and it made an awful noise. Room 345. We didn\u2019t eat here but we did have a drink in the bar which was very quiet. We shall stay again when we return to London </DOC> like all Premier Inns, it's a rather anodyne experience. No charm, pay upfront, typical low quality UK breakfast buffet. And not particularly cheap either- paid 200 EUR a night for a room... However the location is convenient if you need access to St Pancras/King's X and i can see why certain people like the family friendly atmosphere. </DOC> An exceedingly well run and popular Premier Inn opposite St. Pancras Station. Reception very helpful and room allocated on arrival late morning. Spacious standard style bedroom. Excellent breakfast from a cleverly designed buffet. Only stayed one night as on the second night they wanted \u00a3184 for a room - this sort of figure is unwarranted for a Premier Inn. </DOC> Hotel is close to St Pancras, Kings Cross and Euston just a short walk along road. Chose because of its location to St Pancras Eurostar. Typical Premier Inn, clean and comfortable. Although on busy road heard no noise during the night. Didn't have breakfast as we had very early start. It is self check in but there were staff on hand to assist with problems. </DOC> Great location with easy access to Russell Square, Euston and Kings Cross / St Pancras tube stations. Well insulated rooms so even those facing the busy main road offer a good night's rest. Even the pull out bed is very comfortable. Same consistent issue with the too-flat-pillows across all Premier Inns. Reception is on Level 1 rather than Ground, so may be a little inconvenient when checking in and out with large suitcases. Directly opposite the British Library. I can now say I am officially a Premier Inn fan - their consistency of sleep, room, service and quality is fantastic. </DOC> This typical Premier Inn is conveniently situated between Euston and St Pancras Stations, handy for both and also King's Cross. If you are travelling, for example, by Eurostar and having to perhaps have to leave early then this hotel is well worth considering, no frills but spotless, surprisingly quiet, and comfortable, with friendly staff in attendance. </DOC> As a regular overnight traveller between the Pacific Northwest of the USA and Europe, I constantly review my accommodation in central London prior to a Eurostar journey. This Premier Inn is located almost opposite the Kings Cross/St Pancras complex and provides a consistently high standard of accommodation, service and reliability. A two night stay at the end of November 2016 underlined my confidence in Premier Inn and their national standards. My stay was excellent with no exceptions. The standard was reflected in two national awards during my stay - Voted No 1 UK Hotel chain by 'Which' magazine and Trip Advisor reviewers - and my observation that Eurostar staff are amongst the guests. </DOC> hotel is convenient for trains and the british libarary. my room was 6th floor overlooking euston road. room was clean, good size, with chair, table, tea/coffee, good space for clothes hanging. i found the bed ok to sleep in- not too hard as others have said. bathroom was good size also. had the 10.50 pound breakfast. was ok, but 2 things stood out- not enough variety in cheese and yogurt provided. staff were friendly and attentive to guests needs.",

        "docs": "This is a great location for us as we arrive in London from Euston Station. The staff were extremely pleasant and helpful on checking in and our room was quiet despite overlooking the busy main road. The hotel must have very good double glazing! The hotel has a nice little bar where we found a very friendly lady who explained the happy hour system. Would not hesitate the recommend this hotel. </DOC> Premier Inns are often my first choice and the location of this near to the stations is perfect. Four or five stops on the tube and you're in Trafalgar Square. The room was as I would expect as was the food and service. Could do with more than a couple of teabags in the room though ! If you drive parking may be a problem but we found parking at the local church for a reasonable price. I would definitely stay again. </DOC> I stayed here with my husband when we needed to get an early train from St Pancras station. The hotel was excellent. The room was comfortable, clean and spacious. Staff was lovely and the bar was great too. </DOC> Very convenient being just across the road from St Pancras station and also near Euston station. Rooms clean and surprisingly spacious for location. Triple glazing means that room quiet despite being on busy main road in London. Staff courteous and helpful. Excellent value for money. </DOC> I have stayed here a couple of times. My room was 338 located at the front of the hotel opposite the British Library. Considering the road is busy the sound proofing is excellent and I couldn't hear any traffic noise. The room was spotlessly clean with a good sized TV. The bathroom was clean with a good shower. Just one small gripe I had to pay \u00a35 for Ultra Wifi....okay they do provide basic wifi for free but at the price I was paying I felt it should be included. This hotel is in an excellent location if you are travelling from Euston, Kings Cross or St.Pancras. Recommended! </DOC> Nice hotel close to St Pancras and Eurostar, easy access to the tube, nice pubs in the proximity. Was a bit reluctant at staying here because I wasn't impressed with their Luton establishment but Premier Inn redeemed themselves. Rooms are comfortable and very clean, friendly staff, nice easy check in, nice bar area. We booked breakfast which was well worth the money, nice choice. Will definitely use again. </DOC> Ideally located for Kings Cross or St Pancras stations, rooms are reasonable size for London, automated check-in on first floor where there is a very small reception. Staff we encountered were all friendly, unfortunately we didn't sleep well at all due to the constant sound of running water from the walls which i assume was waste water, the small reception was extremely busy (30+ international guests) when I checked out so was unable to report the issue... so probably best to avoid first floor rooms especially room 123. To sum up average premier inn in a great location, well insulated against traffic noise and voices, friendly staff. </DOC> Ideally situated for touring the London sites and for travel from the St Pancras International Station. Very quiet hotel. Spacious rooms with neat furnishings, large tv, tea/coffee-making facilities and excellent, large bed and excellent bathroom; all immaculately clean. Very pleasant, helpful staff. A very good quality breakfast spread of hot and cold food. Very reasonably priced food and accommodation and all you need really for visiting London. Thoroughly recommend.",

I stayed in one room at the back of the hotel which is very quiet... but my second room was right on Euston Road looking into the British Library and even this was very well insulated and quiet. I have stayed in most of the Premier Inn's near this one (not the hub) but this is definitely my favourite. </DOC> The hotel is just a short walk from either St Pancras, Kings Cross or Euston railway stations and associated Underground stations. Although our room overlooked the busy Euston Road, the soundproofing was excellent with no traffic noise. Simply furnished in typical Premier Inn style it was very clean with a comfortable bed, which ensured a good nights sleep. We had a meal in the Thyme restaurant before leaving for the theatre. I mentioned that we needed to get off promptly to visit the theatre and the pleasant staff ensured that we had a quick and efficient service. The meal was well prepared and good value. The following morning there was a plentiful selection of food from the breakfast buffet. A regular replenishment of the hot food ensured that it was fresh and hot. All of the staff were exceptionally pleasant making our stay most enjoyable. We will not hesitate to use this hotel again when we visit London. </DOC> We chose this hotel as we needed to be close to the Eurostar for our trip to France. The hotel is typical of chain hotels, clean, comfortable, breakfast was good. There are many god places to eat and we enjoyed watching England in the world cup at a local pub which is an experience we will never forget. No complaints. Would recommend. </DOC> I stayed in room 243 on the second floor. Reception is on the first floor and I was thinking this is going to be a very budget hotel. Check in was fine and when I got to the room, I found it was a large, modern and clean. The bed was comfortable and the bath towel were large. There was coffee making facilities in the room, but no fridge or safe. I didn't bother with breakfast knowing I could get it a lot cheaper else where. The hotel is well located, but there are a couple of Premier Inns close by, so don't get them confused. </DOC> Like most Premier inns it's decent enough,but if you have high standards,I would steer clear of the breakfast offerings,as it's poor quality and mostly microwaved. We'd certainly stay again though.as it's convenient for the tube and easily walkable to central London etc. </DOC> This was our third stay at this hotel - it is very convenient, affordable and ticks the boxes. It wins on location but is also very quiet - the rooms are very well insulated and despite the busy road outside you are barely aware of it. Had not dined here before - we chose the dinner and breakfast package - \u00a353 for two people - all worked for us. We had an early start to catch the Eurostar (check-in only 5 mins walk away), so the 06.30 breakfast service start was really helpful. </DOC> Great rate, helpful friendly staff with an excellent room rate. Excellent location within a 2 minute walk from Kings cross St Pancras tube station. Very secure with access to rooms only by swiping your room card in the lift. Large spacious rooms. Always comfortable beds and decent size towels. Already planning our next trip back to London. </DOC> I always try to stay at this hotel if possible when visiting London on business trips, as it\u2019s so central and handy for Kings Cross. The location is great and for the price the rooms are really spacious, clean and comfortable. This was another positive stay, smooth check in and out and a good sleep!",

The staff were excellent - most helpful and cheerful \u2026 best of all - our train went at 07 20 \u2026. so the Premier Inn was extremely convenient to roll out of bed and get over to the station on time with no hassle. We shall certainly use The Premier Inn St. Pancras again!! Ron&Julia - Ross-on-Wye </DOC> My husband and I stayed here again for three nights. You know precisely what awaits you - which is good! It's very much no frills but also a no frills price. Beds are super comfy, though the shower room a bit of a squeeze. We tried continental breakfast for the first time - decent quality and value. Handy for train stations going north and a healthy walk into Covent Garden. Recommended. </DOC> Reasonable stay, most of the staff were polite and friendly. No water when we arrived but that was rectified during the day. Vending machines out of order. Bar was quite small but friendly service. Had dinner in the restaurant which was fine. it's very convenient for the station and Eurostar. </DOC> Arrived at 10pm. Checked in quickly by friendly staff member. Went to room (quite a long way from the lifts). Internet worked fine. Bedroom clean. Bed very comfortable. Room quiet. I checked out at 8am the next morning to catch train from King's Cross at 8:30am, so didn't try breakfast. Excellent value (for London). Did exactly what was needed. </DOC> This Premier Inn was comfortable with very little noise from busy Euston Road. It is close to Kings Cross Train Station and Tube. Easy walk to station and tube.The area is safe and has many places to eat. </DOC> Does what it says on the tin. Provides comfortable clean accomodation in a good location for a decent price. Can't fault it whatsoever and in fact I was pleasantly surprised how quiet it was considering it's on a main road. Would stay again. </DOC> If you are travelling from St Pancras this hotel is only a 5 minute walk away, & easy to find directly opposite the British Library. Staff are very pleasant & welcoming,even early in the morning! We had a clean, comfortable room which was very quiet. I had booked the \"meal deal\" which is excellent value- 2 courses with a drink for dinner & the full choice at breakfast. It certainly saved trying to find a restaurant on a busy Friday evening. This was our second visit & we will certainly come here again next time we have a train trip. </DOC> I stayed overnight at the Premier Inn London St Pancras. It is directly opposite the British Library. My room was great and the sound insulation was impressive. My only complaint about the room was that there was no two pin power in the bathroom. Why would this be? After a good night\u2019s sleep, I enjoyed breakfast. The staff were very polite. Everything in the breakfast was great, alert from the sausage, which was lacklustre. So close to a top score.",

The breakfast room was nicely laid out with friendly staff. All the staff we engaged with were friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay there again. </DOC> Could not fault this premier inn at all. Fabulous location about a 5-10minute walk from Euston train station and just past another premier inn. Staff on reception were extremely friendly and welcoming and printed me off directions to get to Camden Market. Room was very comfortable amd even though we faced the busy main road, we did not hear any noise and had a very good nights sleep. Highly recommended. </DOC> Loved the hotel, it was walking distance from St. Pancras, stayed here with my family. My daughter has multiple allergies, but at dinner, the waiter was very patient as we worked out a meal she was able to eat. We were very appreciative of the flexibility from the kitchen. Breakfast was not as smooth an experience, but to be fair to them, they were very busy. At the end, we managed to speak to the chef who helped us pick out her breakfast. The rooms were really good, I liked the fact that there were HDMI and VGA ports to connect to the TV, bedside plugs, USB ports, etc. The family was very comfortable and a good size. Will definitely stay again. </DOC> This is a chain hotel and this particular one is relatively new it seems. Walked out door and down a block and you reach the Tube which is great! The rooms are your basic hotel room. slightly small but I think all the rooms in Europe are usually small. They weren't too small though. There is also a couch in the room so basically a third person could have slept in the double room we had. Nice and clean. Front desk employees were extremely friendly and helpful. There is a bar and a restaurant in the building. We paid the package to have breakfast and it had a good selection of hot items as well as pastries, etc. You can either pay for a full breakfast or a continental breakfast. I like the fact that you have to use a key to access the elevator to the floors where the rooms are. I would definitely stay here again. Free wifi. </DOC> This is such a convenient hotel if you're on a flying visit and arriving at St Pancrass. It's right next door, modern, clean and with extremely comfortable beds. It's a lot better than the usual Premier Inn hotels. I wouldn't stay here for more than a night or when travelling privately as the location is not great for visiting the city or having a walk at night. </DOC> Not impressed at all and was expecting much more. The biggest turnoff is the room itself : very basic, small, cheap furniture, small bathroom... I found out that their kingsize bed is only 5 feet wide (150cm) which is much smaller then a Kingsize in continental Europe (180 cm or 6 feet) of the US. Furthermore, it was not attached to the wall, so very wobbly... Very bad night ! On the positive side : breakfast was excellent value for money. </DOC> It's a Premier Inn so you typically know exactly what you'll get. Arrived into King's Cross and had to fly out from here. Basic hotel with basic amenities but no surprises. Easy to get to what you need to. Surprisingly quiet being on such a busy street. The breakfast is poor but hey! </DOC> We had two nights at the Premier Inn, St Pancras. The staff were welcoming and very friendly; there were three lifts and no delays; the fifth floor room was comfortable and quiet (overlooked Euston Road, but, there were perhaps three 'layers' of glazing) and the air-conditioning worked quietly and efficiently. Breakfast was the usual Premier Inn fare and very enjoyable, despite occasional peaks of pressure when guests had to queue for a minute or two. Other Premier Inns seem to suffer problems with the bean-to-cup coffee machine. Here, there were two and they both worked! We enjoyed our stay.",

Improvement needed - TV in room useless, bathroom and bedroom furniture starting to date, air con in room noisy, no idea what\u2019s happening with the laundry but when we checked in the corridors were littered with I assume dirty bedding, never experienced such a mess at a Hotel before, not appealing. Overall I\u2019d stay again. It\u2019s not the most glamorous of Hilton\u2019s and I think it\u2019s probably due a refresh but the price we paid did reflect this. </DOC> I stayed one night in Januray at Hilton Bath. I was upgraded to a suite with great views to the Bath river. The suite was large and clean. Bed was comfortable. There was also a mini-bar and all drinks inside are free! Breakfast was included in my room rate and it was good. The hotel is very close to the Abbey. I took an early morning walk to the Crescent. It was about 10 minutes. I will probably stay at Hilton again next time in Bath. </DOC> Having stayed at a number of city centre Hilton\u2019s/Doubletree hotels I was a bit disappointed with this one. The public areas were very good but the rooms were a little tired. It is also unusual for a city centre hotel not to have an Executive Lounge. Location wise it is central and handy for the city. Breakfast was quite limited in choice compared with others in the chain. The staff as ever are helpful and friendly but because of the reasons given I couldn\u2019t score it any higher than a three. </DOC> This hotel is not as characterful as some others in Bath but it is reasonably priced and has a superb location in the heart of Bath City. All the bars, restaurants and shopping are at your doorstep but it is still set back enough by the river to be quiet and peaceful in the rooms. There is also a convenient car parking arrangement with an adjacent car park and the staff on reception were helpful and friendly.. On the down side the rooms are relatively small even when we paid an extra \u00a310 for an upgrade to a larger room, It's also not the most attractive hotel and could do with a bit of refurbishment on the outside to improve the appearance. Nevertheless I would recommend it if you are visiting Bath. </DOC> Standard issue Hilton. Friendly reception. Pleased to see. King size bed but disappointed to realise it was two mattresses lashed together with the resultant lump in the middle. Pathetic pillows. We had a family \"Plaza\" room whoch meant a double sofa bed. Room was clean but bathroom could've been cleaner. Didn't partake of any other food/facilities. </DOC> We stayed for 2 nights there; the hotel is close to the train station and many attractions are close by. The hotel building is not attractive from the outside. Noisy street. Lighting was ok; good bed; small but efficient bathroom. Our view was onto the city. The breakfast room was lovely right next to the river. Food was adequate. </DOC> This was my first stay at this city centre property which is within walking distance of Bath Spa station (a big plus when compared with my usual hotel). My corner room was a little larger than usual with a nicely refurbished bathroom with the usual good quality Hilton toiletries. Very nice new bed and great sheets and pillows. Service all round was excellent with an exceptional receptionist and very friendly and capable restaurant and lounge staff. A very good buffet breakfast was included in my very reasonable rate - melon balls included which I haven't seen for ages. A great stay in a very central location close to lots of restaurants and shops and the lovely Bath Abbey. </DOC> Had a small twin room, noisy from the corridor and outside, heating was temperamental, it's clean but dated. Bed not very comfortable. Breakfast was OK, there's a cold buffet choice too. Staff in the restaurant at breakfast were lovely. Ate one night in the restaurant and had buffet lunch too, which were OK, not brilliant. It's a bit dated really.",

The choices at breakfast were greatly superior to my last Hilton experience and the ease of check in and out was superb. A pleasant stay and will definitely use again. </DOC> We stayed here overnight with friends on a visit to Bath. The staff are very helpful and kind, the hotel is centrally located with amazing views. The reason I am giving this a 3 is that we were charged roughly 120 Pounds but the hotel itself is in desperate need of refurbishment, the carpets are smelly and turned grey, the furniture is dated and worn out, rooms feel gloomy. For that price you would expect more value. </DOC> This was my first visit to this particular Hilton and its in a great location. I stayed there as was going to watch rugby at the Rec ( it's only a 5mins walk ) but for those who wish to visit Bath itself, then it's less than a 5min walk and you are there. Breakfast was good and the staff very courteous. One young chap even shook my hand as he said good morning. My only criticism was that there was a queue to check in and no apology from the check in staff for that. Otherwise fantastic </DOC> The hotel proper and our room were very clean. The size of the room was more than sufficient for two adults. Unfortunately there are no useable electrical outlets on either side of the bed. However, I always bring along an extension cord for this situation. The bath had the usual toiletries and appeared to be well maintained as the tiles and grouting were clean and our king bed provided a decent night\u2019s sleep. Surprisingly, there was an anti-skid mat in the bathroom \u2013 a feature often omitted by hotels. The free WiFi, whose worked flawlessly throughout the hotel with both laptop and cell phone without problems. The buffet breakfast has most of everything one would expect of a full English breakfast and was filling. </DOC> Visited with a group of friends for afternoon tea a few weeks ago. The selection of sandwiches and cakes was decent,but the presentation wasn't great. The service was very hit and miss. We had been there 20 minutes before our glasses of champagne was brought over. No tea was provided when the cakes arrived so we had to request it. Finally,we asked three times for a jug of water before it arrived. A decent afternoon tea let down by poor service. </DOC> This hotel could hardly be more central - a great location, just minutes walk from the main sights. It is, however very dated and in need of refurbishment. My room was ridiculously hot, the window didn\u2019t open and the air con was faulty. The electric sockets didn\u2019t work either as the screws stopped the plugs being inserted properly. Also be aware that the walls are terribly thin and noise carries from neighbouring rooms. All of that aside, it was a convenient stopover. </DOC> We paid for an upgrade to a family room which was much larger than the standard room with a nice view of the river. The staff was very nice and the restaurant was pretty good for breakfast and dinner. The location is very good for getting around to the sights in town. The Abbey, the baths and the train station are an easy walk from the property. There is a grocery store next door the hotel which had the electric plugs converter we forgot to bring and the hotel was out of. </DOC> As I'm sure you have discovered by now, accommodation in centre Bath is very expensive! I always like to be in the centre of a nice town or city... I hate having to get taxis etc... so with that in mind we stayed 3 nights here... got a deal at \u00a3440.. including a superb breakfast. The location is just superb... 4min amble to the baths.. staff super friendly and rooms spotless. Only negative thing.. rooms 121... are a tad small... but very comfy bed.. I wudnt take 121 again... just coz it's next to lifts.. I also didn't like the \u00a317 day parking.. if u use a car each day... overall, I'd gladly return.",

        "docs": "Four of us went to the Hilton for a Saturday afternoon tea. There was a large party in one room but we were led to the other room with a table next to the window with a view of the river and bridge. We were offered a glass of Prosecco and we said that we would have our tea a bit later and at that time we checked that our tea also included one vegetarian option and fish/veggie option. The restaurant area did start to get busier and there was a bit of confusion with our 2 alternative options and we were informed that they went to the wrong table. The head waiter was very apologetic and we said it didn't matter as we were not in a rush and we were kindly offered another glass of Prosecco of each. The tea was worth waiting for and was good quality with lovely scones. We had a great time and would go back. </DOC> It\u2019s central. That\u2019s it! Checkin is a ludicrous 4pm and it\u2019s rigidly enforced even for Diamonds and even when it\u2019s empty the night before! Checkout is 11am. The rooms are tiny, sparsely furnished and very dated. The bathroom is Lilliputian. It\u2019s dirty and run down. Torn curtains, mould around windows. River view rooms have a wonderful view of a flat roof and air on ducts! The queue for breakfast was a dozen deep and the floor of the restaurant littered with food. Simply not enough tables and no where near enough staff. It was quite simply my worst hotel stay in many years. </DOC> One of the good hotels in bath They are very friendly treated staff and they try to do everything to make you comfortable and they find solutions for every problem may face you .. I appreciate their effort.. there hotel will be my destination here ever. </DOC> I had hoped the reviews were unreasonable but I was wrong. This is an old style Hilton which means it\u2019s old and tired needing some serious TLC. Can I recommend that the hotel pays a contractor to clean the stairs leading from the car park as we felt we needed a shower after climbing them due to the stench - you can imagine of what!! Room hot and smelly, breakfast mediocre, we won\u2019t be staying here again. </DOC> A Hilton I guess is a Hilton. The location is great and you know the base level fo service you will get when you stay here. The one in Bath is located very well and the rooms are good, typical of what you might expect. If you want no surprises then the Hilton could be the best place to stay in Bath, i would argue though there are ones with lots more character. </DOC> Visiting for the weekend, this place is very central and worked well for us. Room was ok, breakfast was good with lots of choice but it was the fact that we could bring our dog that was most beneficial </DOC> The location is hard to beat, within easy walking distance to many of Bath's attractions. Parking is off property, but next to the hotel. The hotel itself is a bit tired and in need of a make over. The room we stayed in was nothing special but comfortable enough, sort of what you would expect. Breakfast staff was very nice, but checking in and out was a most impersonal experience. Would stay again because of location. </DOC> I like the Hilton in Bath. The location is great and the staff are really good too. My main gripe is the price.... of everything! \u00a315.00 for parking (payable every time you exit the car park). \u00a315.00 for wifi (I didn't bother, I could pick up loads of free BT hotspots from my room). You can rarely get a room for under \u00a3100 per night unless you book in the sale. That said, comfortable, clean and quiet once the fun runners had left at the weekend). Would I recommend? I guess I would, because although it is expensive, so are all the other decent hotels in the city.",

Restaurant OK, staff friendly, nothing to complain about. </DOC> I stayed in this hotel for one night and it was a pleasant experience. I arrived at 1030 in the morning and to my delight the receptionist managed to find me a room that was ready (thank you Natalie!). The rooms are of a high standard and even if it is a modern hotel, it has managed to retain its historic charm and elegance. It is a bit expensive, but I booked months in advance and managed to get a room only rate for \u00a375. If I might complain about something it has to be the bed which was a bit hard. </DOC> The staff are nice enough and there are worse places to stay but everything in the hotel is in need of a fullsome refurbishment. The minimum has been done to \u201cmaintain\u201d standards, and feels like that has been the case for a generation. </DOC> A iconic hotel in city centre next to rail station part of q- hotels group well appointed rooms of reasonable size many overlooking city square comfortable beds clean rooms staff very helpful and courteous excellent breakfast with good quality ingredients of a buffet style nice relaxing bar generally a good choose for city centre and rail and road links value for well deserved 4-star hotel Michael, Elaine .Sheffield January 2016 </DOC> Stayed on a Saturday and had a good stay. Great location, great price and good standard. Would always recommend and choose this place when visiting. Staff are attentive and friendly too. No complaints. </DOC> Yes the hotel is dated but it's Art Deco and that's the charm. If you want an ultra modern hotel with new furniture everywhere this isn't the place. It's got historic glamour and is a beautiful building. By far the best aspect are the staff. The people in the queens bar are excellent. Really welcoming and friendly. I spent two days here interviewing and they are spot on. Reception staff are also fantastic and the concierge are as old school as it comes. For a business trip in Leeds this is as good as it gets. Stay here. </DOC> The staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was clean but I felt it was tired. I had a great night's sleep. The breakfast in the morning was first class ! Overall I expected more class for the money. </DOC> Very helpful staff on reception when checking in. Same could be said for the breakfast staff too! Room was overlooking the front of the hotel which made it noisy with the traffic unfortunately, but my advice is to take ear plugs! Very convenient location to see the city! Breakfast was buffet style with everything you would need.",

        "docs": "I stayed here with some girlfriends whilst on a university reunion. The hotel could not have been in a more perfect place - right next to the train station and a bus stop for Leeds/Bradford Airport and within a 5 minute walk into town. Upon arrival, the staff were extremely friendly and helpful allowing us to leave our luggage until we checked in. Our single rooms were large, clean, well decorated and had everything that we needed. We didn't eat in the hotel either for dinner or for breakfast preferring to try some of the eateries in Leeds. Our check-out was quick and easy and was dealt with the same professional customer service and friendly staff. Would we stay again - absolutely! </DOC> Not our natural choice of hotel as this is quite traditional, however we had an excellent stay at this central location. Valet parking not cheap \u00a321 per day at weekends but very convenient. Andy the concierge was superb. Room was lovely and bathroom. Little touches needed to keep the quality as high as it needs to be. Nice bar area with good choice of drinks. I rarely give 5/5 for a hotel stay but this was deserving of it. </DOC> Stayed for one night, on arrival and for the whole stay I have to say the service was second to none. The hotel bar is very expensive at \u00a35 a pint. The beer wasn't that great either! The room was excellent, very well appointed, very comfortable. If I was in Leeds again this would be my hotel of choice. Direct entrance to the station also a great help. </DOC> This is an impressive hotel. Close to the station (literally yards away) the impressive and imposing facade stands a-top a rise as you approach from the station. The building really stands out. Inside many of the original features have been retained (flooring, wall panels, doors) - it feels like a special and unique place to be. In its own way it's exciting to just be in the building (that could be just me of course). Visiting for a meeting, I enjoyed the slightly labyrinthine meander to the meeting room. It's very refreshing not to be in an ultra-modern, plastic and chrome hotel. The old world feel has something about it - something I really like. I'd go back just to 'nose around' the building! </DOC> Ever since i was a child i often wondered what is was like to stay in an hotel like this as we used to pass it every time we got off the train.So this year i had the chance to stay there for one night which was very nice ,The room was clean and very comfy staff were nice and pleasant,the breakfast was good. We would stay here again if the chance arose </DOC> Brilliant location, handy for the station and visiting the sights of the city. The hotel itself has a great historic interior, dating from 1917, and the rooms are clean and well equipped. Don't know why you would stay anywhere else. </DOC> Overall clean and functional but room was cold and no radiator only air conditioning which did not heat up room. Staff friendly and breakfast good value for money Very central for train station and shops </DOC> Art Deco 30s style railway hotel in a perfect location. It\u2019s trying to maintain its preeminent status as the best hotel in Leeds and on the whole, I\u2019d say it\u2019s doing a good job. The standard rooms are a little bit small and tired, but still okay. Common areas feel rather grand. I especially loved the lifts, very old fashioned looking with proper buttons and a little sign that lights up to tell you \u201ccar coming\u201d! Valet parking puts your car in the basement - a fascinating large area which is worth taking a look at. I\u2019ve never been anywhere quite like it. Staff are good and maintain a certain old-fashioned courtesy which I rather liked. Definitely worth giving this place a try. Ideal if you are travelling by train, as there is a direct entrance from the station.",

        "docs": "Great location next to station . Whilst many of the lovely old features of this grand old station hotel are intact it could do with some TLC and also to \"get with \" the modern world The food is decidely unglamerous ( no wonder the restuarant was deserted ) Bit of a struggle for veggies and vegans , but not impossible . The decor is tired , but bedrooms do come equipped with a trouser press so you can warm up a veggie wrap to keep you going . Its a very large hotel with no gym and a relationship with a local gym that still charges hotel residents \u00a38 a visit!..that is poor customer service . </DOC> * Great Position * Efficient Reception * Rooms - Clean and well equipped * Bathroom - compact but clean * Nice Bar but no natural light * My colleagues said Breakfast excellent Would I stay here again...Yes. </DOC> Very friendly staff, great and cosy rooms, I asked to be in a rear room as it can be quiet busy at the front of the hotel found breakfast to be really average from a product quality and poor value having paid extra on top of room rate. </DOC> Marvellous location for train travellers and shoppers this hotel met our expectations. It was a gift from a family member and suited us perfectly . Nice roomy bedroom on 6th floor with a bath as requested. Double glazing worked and with it closed heard none of the city \"buzz\" All the staff we came into contact with were pleasant and friendly. If I was looking for a moan it would be the lift, but as we had few time restraints its rather erratic visitation of floors was just amusing and we got there in the end!! Yes it could have money spent on it, but for the era of it (opened 1939) it was clean and very acceptable . Will very likely return. </DOC> From the outside the hotel looks similar to the many historical large hotels that were built adjacent to major railway stations however internally it has been transformed by a modern but sympathetic renovation programme. My rom (110) was spacious and tastefully decorated / carpeted albeit slightly dark. It was well equipped with large TV, tea tray, hairdryer, safe, trouser press, gown, air conditioning and bathroom essentials. Dinner was excellent quality with very good service levels. Positives include it's central location, close proximity to rail and free Wi-Fi. The downside was the \u00a315.95 parking charge albeit via concierge. </DOC> Stayed here for one night for business and had an enjoyable stay. Stylish decor, good food, service and comfortable rooms with all the amentities needed. Just next to the train station which is practical. . </DOC> Booked last minute, so handy that it\u2019s built onto / into the train station. Large hotel with lots of character. Clean, smart, modern rooms. Comfy bed. Lovely bathrooms. Lighting a bit dull in bedroom. WiFi perfect. Would stay here again. </DOC> Stayed one night.Situated next to the railway station this large hotel is ideally placed for central Leeds. It\u2019s a nice old building with history. Large reception area, check in was smooth, room on floor 6 was large, however some of the fittings and carpets are a bit tired. That said it was very clean and had character , unlike many chain hotels. Good sized bathroom, desk and comfy chairs as well as large bed . Our room faced out front but was very quiet.Large bar area on ground floor. Doorman at the front very helpful in giving directions and assisting guests. Did not eat or have breakfast. Good stay, location was the key for us. Would recommend.",

Ate elsewhere as on a business event. I thought the breakfast was particularly good, nice place to eat, excellent selection of very fresh breakfast items and loads of choice. Staff throughout the hotel all very nice and the hotel is a perfect location, more so if arriving by train as right near the train station. My choice of hotel when ever I will now stay in Leeds. </DOC> Due to the great deals going around for the Queens, we booked for 3 weekend breaks then realised what if its no good.No worries there absolutely brilliant break and we cant wait to come back. Arrived by train, hotel right next door. Great, swift check in and a room we couldn't knock.Spacious,clean and a very comfortable bed.A proper hotel with character and staff that were great no complaints at all.Position of hotel for shopping, pubs and restaurants couldn't be better.Got to mention breakfast quality ingredients one of the best if not the best in a hotel of this standard that we have had, loved it.See you again end of August cant wait. </DOC> Didn't stop overnight but attended an event in the ballroom. This place looks good from the outside and impressive as you walk into the reception. The staff are smartly dressed and pleasant. The ballroom is large in size and well Able to take the Cupples of hundred guests in attendance. Can't comment about the price of drinks because it was a free bar however the food was good. Just wish that they had a better selection of deserts. Parking is close by, at the station, and at a fiver it isn't bad. Enjoy. </DOC> Although I booked online, I was allocated a suite, complete with sitting room. Quiet, comfortable bed, good night's sleep, excellent bathroom. I love the Art Deco in this hotel. Very convenient for the station. </DOC> Not always a big fan of large hotels but this one was great. The room was very comfortable, lovely bed, nice shower, coffee making facilities, iron. Staff couldn't be more helpful and friendly. Let us have an extra hour check out too. The location is perfect, right by station and city centre. </DOC> This place has seen better days and while I prefer traditional fittings and furnishings to empty modernity, one suspects that it's the kind of place that would have been deemed posh a few decades ago. My single room was gloomy with a narrow bed that moved around on its coasters and little space to swing a cat. All would be absolutely fine if the place were cheap - but it really isn't. Handy for the station and some good pubs. </DOC> My husband and I have stayed here quite a few times now, it is very convenient for both business and leisure purposes. Valet parking is exceptional, the concierge is very polite and helpful. Front desk staff excellent- looks like a change in staff? Lots of new faces, all eager, can't do enough to help. New bar manager too I think? Bar has gone up again in my estimations, a small error with our order was rectified instantly. We stayed on 8th floor Q rooms. This hotel is very handy for travelling by train, with an array of shops and coffee shops scattered within. I will be staying here again next month for business purposes, thank you all. </DOC> Stayed here one night. Hotel Is right in the centre of the city so ideal for a night out or business in the city. Reception was friendly and helpful and check in easy. Room was a sensible size though not massive but big enough. Bathroom had a bathtub and was clean. Bed,was comfortable enough and we had a good nights sleep, noise from the city despite being on the first floor wasn\u2019t intrusive. Breakfast was good with plenty of choice, I was happy with what was available. Overall for the price we paid, \u00a385 including breakfast for 2, value was excellent.",

        "docs": "The hotel is centrally located in Belfast. It is situated across the city hall and close to stores, banks and restaurants. We were there for five days. The rooms are a bit dark but clean. Being an American, I prepared myself for a tiny hotel room with a small bed, but I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the room. The bed was low to the ground but extremely comfortable. We were there during a cold and rainy time, so it was nice to have heated pipes to warm up your towels to use after your showers. Downstairs, the cafe had tea and other drinks available all day for a reasonable price. Our room came with breakfast, which I totally recommend. It is a huge Irish breakfast with all the fixings! I enjoyed the hotel very much for the price. </DOC> Spent a couple of nights here and thought it a perfect location for exploring Belfast. Also staff very good; concierge Patsy was very helpful, including getting us a dinner booking at very short notice in a restaurant which was supposed to be full! The first room they showed us was very small and there was some noise from roadworks, so Patsy got us another in the old building. It was in fact a small suite and was very roomy. There was no extra charge. Whilst there was some traffic noise it was not too bad, even for my wife who is a very light sleeper. Anyway there is a trade off with city centre location in that. Breakfast was very good and the whole stay most enjoyable. </DOC> The hotel is in a great location in downtown Belfast, and the rooms are of a decent size. Be careful of the parking arrangement the hotel has with the National Car Park down the road. We stayed for two nights, and on the second day we went for a drive, so went to the car park to retrieve the car. Could not get out of car park unless we paid the 25eur, thought we would be reimbursed the 14 euro by the hotel - No. You need to get a 'voucher ticket BEFORE you get your car out, as the less than friendly duty manager informed us. </DOC> This is a very comfortable and well-designed hotel in the centre of Belfast - more or less opposite the city hall. Parts of the building are quite historic, although those rooms command a premium and we stayed in one of the newer, and possibly quieter, rooms at the back. The staff were friendly and helpful - we felt very welcome. The breakfast was a little disappointing - when Northern Ireland has such good bread, it's a shame that there is only industrial sliced to make toast with. There was also quite a lot of construction going on and we suspect that the hotel might not be quite as quiet during the week. </DOC> No complaints here except at check in. They have a strict policy to restrict checking in to your room until 3:00 - even if your room is ready. Of course you can pay extra, 25 pounds I believe, ahead of time for that privilege. We sat in the lobby for an hour waiting for our room even though they already had delivered our luggage to that room. This seems like the new wave of making money. All that said, the room was nice and modern. The bar and restaurant were very nice. Great location as well. </DOC> Stayed in Ten Square in Belfast for one night in June. Though the hotel is located in a historical building and has a central location, the rooms are very ordinary and the bathrooms more so. For something that is boutique and touted as special, a little disappointing. </DOC> We called into Ten Square for a drink. There was a very good atmosphere. Ordered cocktail from Eoin who looked after us well. Eoin kindly took us up to the Loft roof top..wow... Met Boris who was fantastic. Sat us outside and was able to tell us all about the buildings. Views of City Hall at night were amazing. Very romantic setting sitting looking at Belfast sipping our drinks. Thank you Boris for excellent service. I was in Belfast for a birthday weekend. You made our visit here very special. </DOC> Ive stayed in this hotel a few times now and it is always an enjoyable experience. The staff from reception, bar, restaurant, housekeeping etc are all friendly and professional. The rooms are spacious, modern, fresh, clean & warm. The food is delicious, warm and well presented. I genuinely can\u2019t fault this hotel and I look forward to staying again in future.",

Starters of Bang Bang Chicken, Tempura Prawns and Duck Bon Bon's were all very good, Sirloin steak decent but the Rib Eye a tad stringy. </DOC> Birthday girl night out, excellent service, Kyle our waiter, Annemarie, waitress and manager all very attentive. Food good, though you do need to order extra sides, good home made chips! Chicken bang bang, large helping as main course. </DOC> I've been wanting to stay here for years and managed to bag a good deal. Very attentive staff and I stayed in the modern extension with large beds, rooms and a good standard. The bar and restaurant were being totally refurbished, so breakfast was temporarily upstairs in the first floor function room. Only picky points were a small desk ( I had work to do), no drawers to put clothes in and (pet hate) small designer sink that looks good but not very practical when washing/shaving. Otherwise a pleasant stay right in the heart of the city. </DOC> We stayed here for a gig in the Odyssey and it was a perfect weekend stay. Great location ,friendly staff, spotless modern rooms and excellent bars/restaurants. Parking discounted for guests. Ten Square again for us next time in Belfast </DOC> Stayed here on business on Thursday. Cracking little hotel. Room was really spacious and so well kitted out. Small things like dental kits, shaving kits in bathroom which was big with a huge walk in shower. Bed was so comfortable. Breakfast was top class. Staff so nice. Would definitely stay here again. </DOC> Stayed here for 2x nights in early October with my wife, we came in with the train from Dublin (15min walk from the station). The hotel itself was new. The facilities were all modern: aircon, excellent wifi, modern bathroom and over 100 channels on the Flat screen tv. The hotel is very centrally located, just behind Belfast city hall, so getting around is very easy, in what is in any case a small and walkable city. We stayed on the 6th floor and had our window closed during the night so street noise was not an issue. Can see how maybe if you were lower down it could be on a Friday/Saturday night. Breakfast was included which was adequate. The staff at the front desk were also friendly and helpful. Recommend, would stay again. </DOC> We only ate here, didn't stay. The large dining room was comfortable and airy. Food was good quality and reasonably priced, especially the evening set menu. But the friendliness of the service is what I'd especially commend. </DOC> This was great find in Belfast. The room rate was very reasonable. The rooms were of good size and they had nice walk in showers with plenty of room. The furnishings were modern and very clean.The restaurant and bar downstairs were very nice and had a great breakfast. Patsy and Kevin at the concierge desk were extremely helpful. The bar upstairs at the top of the hotel is a great hidden secret. it is called the Loft and has a great view of the city. It does have some outdoor seating as well. They have a hotel package that includes the Titanic museum and a Black Taxi tour which you can do all in one day. It is well worth it.",

What marks this hotel as exceptional though is their staff. From front desk to bar and restaurant we were treated as welcome guests, not inconvenient strangers. Those who worked the bar chatted with us, were willing to do more than just stand and take orders. I would go back to this hotel in a heartbeat. Comes very close to one of best stays in a hotel ever. </DOC> We stayed one night on our way from Arran to Glasgow as we returned our rental car at Glasgow Airport next door. Reception was very welcoming, our room spacious the bathroom quite elegant all spotless throughout. Sleep quality is excellent as windows are double if not triple glazed. There was zero airport noise. We had a marvellous dinner in the hotel's restaurant. We had to be on a train to Chester at noon the next day and Reception advised that a taxi from the front door would be exactly the same price as an airport shuttle bus a kilometre away and they were absolutely right. We would be delighted to stay at this very well run hotel at any time in the future. Thank you Courtyard at Marriott. </DOC> The rooms are big, clean with a double shower. It looked like it had just been refurbished and smelled like new carpet. Chloe was really helpful, thanks. Parking is a little expensive but it\u2019s right opposite the airport, circa 15 mins walk. </DOC> Nice hotel but I felt really overpriced at \u00a3145 for one night's stay. As I have mobility issues, it was hobson's choice for me as it was the only hotel available on the date I required and I was travelling solo. That said, it was nicely decorated and had a huge comfy bed with quality toiletries. Also cost me \u00a37 for a taxi to the airport on my departure date due to the distance involved for me walking with luggage on my own. Perhaps for the cost of the hotel, consideration of a courtesy shuttle bus might be an idea. </DOC> Was staying over the road at the Travelodge and could not be bothered to venture far for dinner, so walked over to the Marriott. Kept it nice and simple burgers and haggis bonbons. Food was perfectly cooked. The fries were great. I should have asked what make they were but they were really nice. Haggis bonbons were lovely. For a budget hotel, the food was great. I know most of the food is pre-prepared, but the actual cooking and presentation were very good. </DOC> Can be hard to find if you are driving. No shuttle & definitely not walkable from GLA. Brand new (or extremely remodeled) with all the modern conveniences. Modern, new, fast internet. Rooms do not have a desk, just a shelf with a hassock. Breakfast is an extra 12 pounds. </DOC> Stayed here again last night for work purposes. 2nd time visit. And it was just as good as last time. Good welcome. Lots of parking and the food was pretty good. I found the room clean and tidy and comfortable too </DOC> Lovely modern hotel. The room was excellent and very comfy. The only issue I had which you can\u2019t blame the hotel for is the many buses of tourists which I just missed at check in but didn\u2019t miss for the evening meal or breakfast. It was awful at breakfast especially and it is not designed for that many. Even at check out I left early as I didn\u2019t want to be delayed. So the room was great but the 3 buses full of Asian tourists wasn\u2019t a relaxing business experience but shows how popular this hotel is.",

The pedestrian walkway gets you to the airport in less than 10 minutes - would stay here again if needed a place near the airport. </DOC> Short 8min walk from the airport or ample parking makes this a good place to stay, the staff were friendly and accommodating with good sized rooms and excellent bathrooms. Great Wi-Fi throughout and comfy beds. I would stay here again. </DOC> The hotel looks new, it is clean, it has a bar with good drinks, a restaurant, a lobby. It is worth the price, it looks like 4 not 3 stars. The only problem was that the heat in our room was not working, in our friends room it worked, so it was not a general problem, they said they will come to fix it but noone came. I didn\u2019t insist and it was also 10 PM. </DOC> Lovely friendly helpful staff when I arrived just before midnight. Rooms really nice, loads of toiletteries,creams, toothbrushes in rooms, and nice coffee in rooms too, they have even put takeaway cups in there with lids. </DOC> Recently stayed for the first time prior to an early morning holiday flight. From check-in to check-out during our brief stay all staff were friendly and helpful. Bedroom and hotel were spotlessly clean and the bed comfortable also - we will definitely be back again if needing to stay before a flight. </DOC> We stayed on Saturday 1st July prior to an early morning flight to Berlin. We were super impressed with the friendly and helpful service from the young lady who checked us in. There was a bit of confusion regarding the car park payment but she smoothly and efficiently sorted this out for us. The room was pretty amazing as far as airport hotel rooms go, we were totally impressed with every aspect of our stay. This is one hotel I would be very happy to recommend and would definitely use again. </DOC> Modern Courtyard hotel. Rooms are unusually large by Scottish standards with very modern baths. The staff is good and quite helpful (we were there during the European Championships and the hotel was being used as the base for several national cycling teams which made it a bit busy). The negative. It\u2019s about a 10 minute, not overly well marked, walk from the Glasgow Airport terminal. If you\u2019re going to call a hotel an airport hotel and it\u2019s not physically on the airport property, it should have a shuttle van. This one doesn\u2019t. </DOC> We travelled 2 weeks in Scotland and stayed at Hilton and Marriott properties. I can say that this was the best room in all our travels - roomy, clean - it actually appeared brand new-- we were on the 3rd floor. We stayed at the Glass House in Edinburgh - at a much higher cost for a much inferior room -- yes location location location but very happy with our room. While not as convenient to the Holiday Inns -and no shuttle to the airport, the walk is only 10 minutes to the airport and from reading prior reviews -- 7 pounds for a taxi is a rip off. Sad that breakfast was not included (I am a Platinum member) but it was my fault as I had forgotten that Courtyard does not provide that benefit reason why I avoid staying at this Marriott property.

The room was large with decent appointments. The bathroom was great with a stand up shower and a large soaking tub. The biggest issue we had was with the bedding where the comforter was just big enough to cover the top of the bed with no overhang so we were fighting for covers all night. </DOC> Kevin greeted us at reception. I asked him where a family would go to dinner. He and Michael at the Old Jameson Experience said The Cornstore. He pulled out a map and showed us exactly where it was. I asked if he could call a taxi and he not only arranged a taxi to pick us up at the specified time with a courtesy call to our room, but got us reservations at the restaurant. His kindness was greatly appreciated!! The room was wonderful. Probably one of the best rooms we had on entire trip to Ireland. Great view of the river and across into Cork. Clean, clean, clean. Lots of soaps and lotions and a luxurious bath tub. When you step out of the elevator you walk into a mini lounge on each floor with huge windows. Loved the light weight comforters on the beds. Good security with key only access to the floors. </DOC> Love this hotel. Its handy for the work location I go to. But more importantly its handy for the location to town after a hard days work. Loads of lovely restaurants nearby. The staff are all so lovely. </DOC> Very clean and tidy hotel, rooms are well proportioned and those with a view of the river are fantastic. Plenty of attention to detail in the rooms and the hotel. It is a shame that the main bar and restaurant are currently closed for refurbishment, the staff do their best in the limited foyer space for the temporary bar area, but it can get a bit crowded in the early evenings. The breakfast is excellent, with plenty of options to keep everyone satisfied. Fresh tea, coffee and toast available on request. My only request would be a choice of firmer pillows in the rooms, other than that all good. Staff all very efficient and helpful, if a bit overstretched at peak hours with check in and bar area merging into one. </DOC> We stayed one night in the River Lee hotel.

We thought the room was spacious, clean and very comfortable. I could hardly wait to lay on the bed, it was so inviting. We would definitely stay there again should our travels bring us to Cork. </DOC> There is almost too many good things to mention about The River Lee. Lets start with the location right on the water. The rooms are large with floor to ceiling windows on our floor. The glass elevators are impressive. We are staying here 4 nights and it is worth it. </DOC> Stayed for one night in December in this Hotel, especially after reading the excellent reviews. I decided to pay the extra and book and Executive Room and Requested a River View. However the Room that I was allocate was on the side close to the elevator with a rather small window and when you look out the window and strain your neck and look left you would get a glimpse of the River. Customers, please be aware that the Pictures you see on the hotel website of the Executive Rooms, is nothing like what I was allocated. It was on the 5th Floor, but a very standard Room. This was very disappointing. The Bar Staff are very unfriendly and you have to keep demanding service. I had Dinner in the Dining Room and the Service was Excellent and so was the Food - First Class Here. Breakfast the next morning was also a wonderful Experience. </DOC> Having read so may positive reviews on Tripadvisor, I fully expected to be disappointed by The River Lee Hotel as I felt it could not live up to these expectations. However, it not only lived up to expectations, it exceeded them. Everything about the hotel was first rate - attractive lobby area, clean and spacious rooms, outstanding breakfast and welcoming staff. I rarely give 5 star reviews but what was really great about this hotel were the little extras - for example, offering a bottle of water at check-out. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.",

        "docs": "This is a lovely hotel. Excellent location a short stroll from the middle of town, and nestled on the bank of the river along the Western Road (where the Jury's used to be). It's quite big and glitzy, to the extent that in terms of design it seems more suited to the pre-credit crunch days, but the rooms are comfortable, there's plenty of space to relax and sit around in the public spaces, and the staff are really helpful. Plus if you can get a deal on the overnight rate it's an absolute steal - I think we paid around \u00a363GBP per room per night including breakfast, which made this place outstanding value for money. I'd pay more to stay here and still be happy. Recommended. </DOC> First off the location of this hotel was great and our view of the river from the room was fantastic. Staff was friendly and check-in was very efficient. We do wish they would turn down the heat as the lobby, hallways and common areas are quite hot. Room was just ok, no character - felt very cookie cutter. The bed was very firm and bathroom shower leaked water on floor so you had to use a few towels. The restaurant was decent food but we felt that the clientele and staff were not friendly and seemed to shun us because we have tattoos. Overall we enjoyed the location and friendly front desk staff but as a whole it was just ok. A little under whelming for a Doyle Collection hotel. </DOC> Stayed 2 nights with friends from USA. Very modern hotel. Nice, clean rooms. Lovely bathroom. Very friendly staff. Good restaurant. Good position. Car parking included. They have very good value inclusive packages. There was a problem when we checked in, as our USA friends were given a river view full size room and we were put in the smallest room on the floor with a view of the garbage. No problem when we asked to change to full size room but still got garbage view and couldn't be bothered to change again. Couldn't understand why 2 couples checking in together were given different standard of rooms. Complained on hotel own website and got apology from manager but no explanation. </DOC> Stayed for two nights on business. I've been here before on a number of occasions over the past few years - it never disappoints. Warm welcome from staff, and a high standard of accommodation and facilities. Great choice at breakfast and bar food good and reasonably priced. It's a ten minute walk into the city centre, and a taxi to the rail station was 13 euros. </DOC> You won't find many things modern in this medieval city, except for this hotel. It's located directly on the river just outside of the city but don't worry there are city bikes nearby for rent. I'd give the hotel 5 stars if it had free bikes on site. The rooms are large and the beds are very comfortable. The rooms facing the river are floor to ceiling glass windows for great views. Air conditioning works very well. The bar closes early, but was lively midweek. Staff is friendly and free parking is available underground. Wifi was fast and free. Ask for access to the executive lounge for board games and free snacks. </DOC> Stayed here for 2 nights it is a lovely hotel and the service is exceptional from the minute you arrive and are greeted with a big smile and hot towels to freshen your hands. Had dinner in the restaurant which was very good and snacks in the bar, breakfast had everything you could want. The room was nice and spacious with a view of the river and comfy beds. A nice touch is the complimentary bottled water for your day out or to take to the room. All the staff go that extra mile to make your stay special. </DOC> Easy parking, Excellent check in, the room was lovely with great bed and wonderful shower. The river bar and restaurant were very good. Service during dinner was a little scattered and then intrusive at times would be my only criticism. Great breakfast. All in all a really good hotel. Kevin at the check in desk Was outstanding and really helpful. </DOC> Modern, great views, centrally located all make this place well worth a visit. Parking included. Breakfast for us was included and it was delightful. I will warn you that the hotel seems popular with American tourists and perhaps a few bus tours, but we never had a problem with crowding or them. Rooms are spacious and well designed. We will return if ever back in Cork.",

Good beds , shower and bath , plenty of good quality bath products. Breakfast was good (staff a bit premature with table clean up if you go to the buffet your table has been cleaned of by the time you get back including cutlery , condiments and half finished drinks ) The less than perfect : Limited room service menu between 11 pm and 8 am , no minibar or fridge in the room , big overstuffed pillows are comfy but don't provide much support (no others avaliable) security card access everywhere including the lifts mean you always need a key. The service was efficient but not very friendly. </DOC> We recently visited this hotel on a visit to Cork. Overall it was a great hotel in every way- great room, great facilities and great staff who were exceptionally helpful. The location and proximity to UCC and Cork city was excellent. </DOC> The River Lee was just perfect for our two night stay. Very friendly staff, comfortable rooms, great location (about 10 minute walk into town). We ate in The Weir restaurant one night and the food was fabulous and service exceptional. A great all rounder hotel that shouldn't be overlooked. </DOC> The rooms are very nice and it is an easy walk to the downtown area. We had lounge access which gave snacks throughout the day and a small breakfast which worked well for us.The staff was very nice and helped with any questions we had. </DOC> An Excellent Hotel - Well Managed, 5 Star quality and service, without being in your face and without 5 star costs. My second visit to River Lee Cork is just as good as the first was. Room servicing was particularly good, with lots of attention to detail. A very good choice and quality at breakfast. Staff are very helpful, feel genuine, without being \"in your face all the time\" like many 4-5 star hotels are. Even the hotel laundry was quick and efficient and good value, at less than EU4 for a 12hr wash and press service for a shirt. Cant say much more really. If all hotels offered the same high standard in all areas, and good value for money that the River Lee Cork does, then there would be no need for sites like trip Advisor. Not in centre of city, but just 10mins walk to City Centre. </DOC> Stayed one night recently with my family. A little out of town but an easy walk to the center. Everything about the hotel from the room to breakfast was good. Had a drink in the bar and enjoyed the newness of the hotel. Can tell they take pride in the hotel was a nice property but felt it was a little overpriced. Would stay again based on the experience. </DOC> This is a terrific hotel, located reasonably close to the main part of town, probably 20 minutes walk. Our rooms were very good. The bed in our room was comfortable, the bathroom was clean and well equipped. There is a restaurant and bar and food is available in the bar. The staff are very helpful. All in all, an excellent place to stay </DOC> The hotel is located a bit outside the city center on the river Lee. The city center and all major spots are within walking distance. The hotel is quite new and offers well maintained rooms and a good WiFi connection. The staff is friendly and helpful. This is certainly a good choice if you visit cork by car as it also offers free parking. The breakfast buffet is also quite nice with a good choice.",

On arrival at airport realised I'd left my phone at hotel...excellent customer services from Velina arranging for phone to be returned..would highly recommend and will definitely return. </DOC> This is a superb hotel set in a great location, ( just a short walk and you're in the famous Temple Bar area ) clean rooms with comfortable beds, exceptionally friendly and professional staff across the board, A superb hotel. </DOC> Visited here each year for the last 3 years taking my parents for a pre-Christmas trip. Jury's Parnell st is in a great location for all of central Dublin. There are two things that make it particularly good for me, It provides good value for money. It is reasonably priced for a good standard of hotel. The other thing that makes it my first choice in Dublin are the staff. Excellent attitude and customer service. It felt like coming home. </DOC> We planned our trip later than I would have preferred, so I was concerned about a 3 star hotel. But the reviews on Tripadvisor were very good, and now I agree. To start, we arrived at 5 AM but the hotel found rooms for us. And they honored my request for a quiet room. My room was small - my wife and I found ourselves bumping a lot as we moved around. But the room was clean and quiet and the hot water was good. Our room was hot, and the thermostat did not work; when I found a front desk person who spoke English it was fixed quickly. So, I was a happy vacationer. </DOC> Stayed here for one night with family on our last night in Ireland. The hotel is very nice and newly renovated/modern. Rooms are very clean and spacious. Washrooms also newly renovated and very clean. In a very nice central area of Dublin. My only complaint would be that the parking is several blocks away and difficult to find. Otherwise we enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here again. </DOC> Firstly when my friend recommended this location I was unsure but it\u2019s a brilliant location I really think the rooms are nice modern the hotel is well located for shopping and central locations We ate in the bar and the sea bass was delicious The service all over the hotel was great at all times I would recommend this place it is very safe and fully keycarded. I would certainly stay again Thank you </DOC> Recently stayed for 3 nights. Good location for all city sights. The staff were very helpful and pleasant. Can recommend breakfast. Good choices & always clean. The rooms were good size. No complaints at all. Would recommend. </DOC> my birthday trip away . warm greeting helped us with information through out our stay . in a good location we found. the rooms are typical jury's. bed okay room fine . clean bathroom . hot water no issues with that . the breakfast was typical buffet . started the day off okay on that . i didn't have any problem with this hotel .",

We received a lovely welcome at reception were given lots of information about Dublin and received vouchers for one days breakfast. Our room was lovely, bathroom could have been a bit cleaner and the view over the council rubbish dump wasn't the best! Breakfast was good but we could have been anywhere in the world and it didn't feel especially Irish or special. We were overcharged at the hotel bar and the food was mediocre. They allowed us a late check out at 10 euros an hour which we took advantage of and stayed until 4pm. I would absolutely stay here again but would eat and drink elsewhere. </DOC> Nice hotel in fabulous location. We were checked into a corner room which had lovely views over Dublin and the market street below. The staff were all very very friendly, breakfast was nice with a large selection. </DOC> Beautiful part of the city, opposite a church and in a nice quiet location but only a 10 minute walk to the hustle and bustle of temple bar. Great hotel with fun and friendly staff Room was clean and comfortable </DOC> First time in this hotel for a short stay in Dublin. There for some Christmas shopping and could not have chosen a better placed hotel. Reception was fine. We were there too early but they took our bag and let us start shopping. Room was big and bright overlooking courtyard. Very clean and bed was super. Self service breakfast in restaurant - something for everyone although would have liked the bacon cooked a bit more. Hotel bar (and staff) were great and good place to relax at night. Would have no hesitation in recommending Jurys and will certainly return. </DOC> We had an executive room which was nice, room overlooking road could have been noisy but it was fine you do hear the tram bell ring but again not a problem. Staff were good, hotel bar was pleasant. We would stay again as it worked well for us. </DOC> Comfortable corporate hotel in good city centre location. Good sized functional rooms. Interior design uninspiring. Wall in bedroom scuffed and needing roc (attention to detail). Staff very welcoming and helpful. Breakfast offered a good fresh range. </DOC> Stayed here for 2 nights as part of the organized tour. Everything seems good. It\u2019s quite a modern building. Location is central with only 1 minute\u2019s walk to O\u2019Connell Street and the shopping street. Room is small but clean and tidy. Well it\u2019s probably not small compared to those in Hong Kong. Service is pleasant. Restaurant offers a good variety of breakfast menu. Overall I\u2019m quite happy with it. </DOC> We stayed here for four nights. Our room was 527, it was clean and comfortable. The bed was comfy but the bedding was quite cheap feeling, pillows and duvet a bit thin and cardboard\u2019y. The bathroom was ok but the shower wasn\u2019t very powerful and it struggled through maintain temperature which always gets my goat in hotels. The breakfast was nice, we enjoyed the options. The staff are all very friendly. The bar is a bit hit and miss, one guy that works in it, he wears black rimmed glasses is very good but the others are a bit lack lustre, we had terrible service one night but the other two were fine. The food is really nice. Fairly good location, close to everything. A little walk to temple bar but only 5/10 mins. Close to the shops. We would stay again.",

Excellent, comfortable room with all modern amenities. Excellent choice at breakfast. Only strange thing was that you need a key card to access the toilets in the bar which caused a lot of confusion... </DOC> This was my first time staying at a Jurys hotel. What a great experience. We stayed 5 nights and enjoyed every one of them. Staff was excellent. Friendly, professional and helpful in every way possible. Breakfast was first rate. Loads of hot and cold choices. All were properly made and fresh and tasty. Room was super quiet and very large for a major city. The location was perfect. 10 minutes to the city center, and just steps away from public transport. </DOC> Newly refurbished hotel that could not be more centrally located, just a few minutes walk from O'Connel street. A reasonable sized room, double glazing made for a very quiet night. Air conditioning but no safe or fridge, but ice machines located on each floor. A supermarket across the road, and a large bar/restaurant area on the 2nd floor. The hotel has a gym. </DOC> Everything you would expect from a Jurys Inn in a city centre. The staff are always welcoming and efficient, we were slightly disappointed our room looked out onto a brick wall which as we were there for three nights and had booked some months in advance we thought they could have avoided but I guess that's life in the city for you. </DOC> My wife and I are leaving today after a great 4 night stay. We chose this place after reading many good trip advisor reviews and were happy we did. The hotel is in a really good area to be able to walk to many things! You can get to Temple bar in 10 minutes, over to the hop on hop off bus in 1 minute and you are surrounded by shopping, restaurants, bars, grocery stores and fast food too. The hotel itself is pretty modern, rooms are nicely appointed and fairly good size. We had interior courtyard room and it was very quiet, and the bed was comfortable. We had a tasty buffet breakfast included with the room, thanks to Expedia booking. It was a great stay, perfect for exploring Dublin and the staff is very nice too! Overall a great stay! </DOC> Good hotel in busy part of Dublin. Parking as I found out was difficult and expensive. Friendly greeting at reception and room was of the usual standard. However the room overlooked what looked like a tip/refuse collection facility and the noise was incredibly loud all night. Pillows very uncomfortable in the room, too big to use 2 and too small to only use 1, but that's my personal preference. Bar area was excellent as were the staff. Ate out first night and in the bar the second. Wasn't impressed by the burger I had, very dry and tasteless. Overall a good hotel. </DOC> This hotel is ranked to be one of the better in Dublin. It\u2019s modern with nice rooms. However, the room was not soundproofed so we could hear what the people in the adjacent room were talking about. Internet 25 Mbit down and 23 up.

The hotel is an older hotel, needs some updating in bath and HVAC. We had to leave our window open to keep cool and listen to people on the street talking, starting their cars, etc. The breakfast was mediocre, the best thing was the pub/grill at night. </DOC> Waterfront view, comfortable room, secure parking, nice bar food (didn't have enough room to face the restaurant), reasonable prices and local beer at reasonable prices. Even if it hadn't been lashing down with rain I doubt if we'd have strayed far from the bar! </DOC> Very nice hotel, public areas are very spacious, as was the room. Nicely decorated and finished. Lift to al floors. On the riverside, nice sitting out area, good bar and restaurant. Food was good, staff really friendly and helpful. Town is a 10 minute walk. Everything worked as it should, everything was clean, free internet, good choice for breakfast and on-site parking. Would stay again. </DOC> I'm not sure how this is a three star hotel. The room was visibly worn, dirty grout, broken tiles, really hard beds, no top sheet just a thousand degree down comforter, no fridge, hair dryer or iron and worn carpeting. While parking was accessible and check in was efficient with nice staff, that is about it for praise. The breakfast left a lot to be desired. If you are looking for a place with a great location and parking, then this is perfect. If you're looking for clean, updated & comfortable rooms... perhaps not. </DOC> The Waterford Marina Hotel is a standard nothing fancy hotel. Standard rooms, standard service for a standard price. The view however is very nice and the location in this pretty town is good. While we were there they had mostly guests from tour busses. Breakfast could be better: they have everything, but of average quality. </DOC> This hotel is well situated close to the city center. It is on the banks of the River Suir. It has a gated car park. Check-in was fast and hassle free. There is a fine bar in the hotel and food can also be had here. I liked the snack/drinks dispenser in the corridor and the bright breakfast area. The breakfast was good as was the service. We had dinner there one evening and it was very tasty with excellent service. Bedroom was comfortable and had tea/coffee making facilities. Bathroom was roomy, but had my dreaded shower curtains and fixed shower head. For all of the above and well priced accommodation, I would not hesitate to stay there again. </DOC> We had two nights at The Waterford Marina Hotel and really enjoyed our stay. I like the feel of the hotel. It's friendly and comfortable and warm. Our room had a lovely river view and was spacious and clean and very quiet. We had one lunch, one dinner and two breakfasts during our stay and all the meals were tasty and generous and enjoyable. It's a very good situation, so close to city centre. We would definitely recommend it. </DOC> Nice location on the banks of the river as the name would suggest. This seemed to be a Haven for boat owners and was quite loud and noisy until the early hours. Breakfast was good and room clean and comfortable. About 15 minutes walk into town.",

The bar/restaurant food is great and the specials like roast pork or fish & chips are very tasty. The included breakfast is really good with the highlight for most being the raisin scones. Room 221 - large room with 2 twins and a double bed. It is positioned over the air conditioner unit so is a little noisy. The room could definitely use refreshing since it does look a little shabby and one of the chairs had an odd stain. </DOC> This is located about 10 minutes walk from the town but at the end where you want to be. Advantage is that there is no street noise. Secure parking is provided in a covered parking which is excellent. However the lift had no security which was surprising. Room was fine, a reasonable size and included a safe but no A/C and the bathroom amenities were rather basic for a hotel. The rooms overlooking the river were pleasant. </DOC> The hotel is in a quiet corner of Waterford, but within walking distance to all the attractions. Our room was large and quiet. The bed was comfortable and the shower had great water pressure. Breakfast was buffet style and very good. The hotel has a nice bar and restaurant, but is also near a number of restaurants and pubs.

Great location, room was a little basic and bathroom was looking tired. Breakfast was hit and miss, cooked breakfast was good but continental was poor. Some mornings there were pastries and fruit but other mornings not. </DOC> Situated by the river, a 5-10 minute stroll from the centre of waterford. Had a room overlooking the river. Very spacious, comfortable and quiet. Breakfast was excellent. Choice of cereals, yoghurt, fruit as well as full cooked breakfast. Evening meal can be taken in the bar or in the dining room. The dining room offers a set menu every evening with a choice of courses for a set price. Would highly recommend having dinner in the bar however. It is more relaxed, terrific choice on the menu and the service is second to none. The hotel has a secure enclosed car park at the back. Would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again. Waterford itself is a lovely quaint town to walk around. Lovely harbour area. Plenty of bars with live music and its a town with viking historical interest. </DOC> We had only one night here, but enjoyed the experience. Front desk was welcoming and helpful. Secure parking a short walk from reception, and a pleasant stroll to the city centre. Room was clean and tidy, and the bed comfortable. A recommended stay. </DOC> We only stayed one night and there was nothing wrong with the hotel, but it just didn't seem to live up to expectations. Shop around for rates and if the price is right for you by all means give this hotel a try, but there might be better options at similar prices elsewhere in town. It was OK, but not great.",

Negatives - needs a facelift in terms of decor and overall maintenance, especially in the bathrooms and restaurant. Even the reception desk is need of an overhaul it looks to have seen better days.

There was a decent variety but some items carried hefty supplements (8 euros extra each if you wanted a steak) Breakfast was also very good. </DOC> Decent for a quick night stay.

No toiletries in bathroom. Tea and coffee available in rooms. A good 15 min walk from centre of Waterford. Nice views of river. </DOC> Why the terrible review? Avoid the 2nd floor rooms (221 specifically) above the kitchen and dumpsters or you will surely have a miserable night of sleep and you too will be up at 4:00am to leave a similar review on TripAdvisor. I would have happily closed the window except as one can see, this is the only ventilation they leave in the rooms. Sadly I FINALLY had to scream out the window at 4:30am to tell the staff to shut up. </DOC> This is a good hotel. Modern facilities and well kept. In a nice quiet neighborhood. Our room had a Nice river view. The only negative is breakfast. Not really clean utensils, little choice of (tasteless) food and particularly bad drinks (weak coffee and artificial tasting juices). So my advice is to book it but without breakfast :) </DOC> I had made my reservation through Booking for 3 nights which was reasonable. I realized that I could only stay 2 nights. I asked if they would give me a refund for the one night. I was given some mumbo jumbo and told no. I realize it states no refunds or cancellation but give me a break. They turn around and rent the room for\u20ac110/ night. There was no hot water for the shower. It was barely warm. The soap for your shower was one of those that hangs on the wall and I could barely get any out. So I did not take a shower on the second night. On the positive side, I had wonderful views of River Suir and the room was commodious.",

The room was freezing. We noticed there was no radiator only a little plug in one, I had to leave my coat on it was that cold. Went down to the restaurant and there was no seats, not even at the bar.

This hotel was cheap but I\u2019d rather pay a bit more and stay somewhere else that puts the heating on. </DOC> Good location just off the m56. 5 minutes drive from the main airport terminals. Spacious lounge,bar,dining area on ground floor. Typical good quality room for premier inn. Good size,comfortable bed,fast WiFi,very clean,quiet. Only complaint is the water pressure for the shower could have been better. We paid \u00a380 for one nights stay without breakfast and 7 nights parking at the airport. </DOC> Can't say I enjoyed staying at this premier Inn. Although would stay again for location and price. Booked a family room when infact what we got was basically a disabled access room. Perfect if that's what you need. Beds were absolutely tiny. Not the premier Inn bed we are used to. Have stayed at the one across the road and preferred that. Breakfast we had to wait to be seated, seemed short staffed. No clean tables. Was given a table and when came back from the buffet someone else was in our seats. So we were all split up. Had to wait on breakfast being restocked. Which you would think they would be prepared for at peak times. Along with the waitress being extremely rude we couldn't wait to eat and get going. </DOC> We have used this hotel twice now prior to flying from Manchester airport. If you book in advance you can get a good deal (I think we paid \u00a355 per couple) and it just takes the stress off driving to the airport early in the morning. We didn\u2019t eat her but we had a few beers which were good but slightly expensive. Rather than eat here we got a taxi into Wilmslow for a meal and a few more beers. Bed was comfortable but en-suite very small which seems daft as bedroom absolutely huge, could have easily had a bigger en-suite and slightly smaller bedroom. Five minutes to airport in the morning and your on your way! </DOC> We stayed one night in a room overlooking the car park. The hotel does not have or claim to have air conditioning, only cool air. Irrespective of what the website claims. Needs sorting \ud83d\ude09 Are in the restaurant attentive staff and good food. A comfy bed added to a good nights sleep. A sheet on the bed would help those not wanting to use the quilt in warm weather. We will be back\ud83d\udc4d </DOC> Stayed before a morning flight to the States. Large room with 2 double beds and a silent night's sleep was just what we wanted. Taxi arranged by the hotel was only \u00a36. We booked this hotel early and it only cost us \u00a334. We have stayed in many Premier Inns but this one was different as it had 2 double beds in the room instead of the normal double and make up bed you usually get, and also they had efficient reception staff instead of machines to welcome you. well done on this hotel Premier Inn, DON'T CHANGE IT. </DOC> We stayed here prior to an early flight, combined in a package with Meet & Greet parking. It was perfect: clean and comfy, decent food and a very quick and easy airport parking experience. Premier Inns are always brilliant for an airport stay without breaking the bank. We'll definitely be back. </DOC> This hotel is great for a chain hotel it does what it says we had a large group booked in and it was smooth and easy! Rooms are a fair size and have everything you need for a pre flight stay All I can say is bar is pricey but all hotels are the same enjoy a nice stay here !",

        "docs": "All good here apart from the lift being out of order ,but given credit for car park and moved to lower floor without asking! So overall no complaints and lift sorted 1 hour later prior to evening meal in restaurant </DOC> Can't get anywhere better for a park and stay - for the price. The hotel is very close to the airport and the meet and greet arrangements for parking whilst out of the country are unsurpassable - very easy and right next to the terminal. The hotel's staff are excellent and the breakfast and dinner deal is very good value. This was a brilliant start to our Transatlantic adventure. </DOC> We arrived here from a very late flight. Very quiet considering its proximity to the airport. As with nearly all Premier Inns, very clean an comfortable. Convenient that a restaurant is attached so that breakfast on site is possible. Downside that an extra \u00a310 is charged for overnight parking on site if you take Park and Fly package, but surely most people would factor this in beforehand. Friendly staff makes a nice contrast to the usual anonymity of airport hotels. </DOC> Arrived late evening but the restaurant staff were friendly and efficient. Food was well presented and hot, quite an interesting menu for an airport hotel. It was just so quiet in our room, good job I took my alarm clock!! There is no wake up call facility but you can request a clock from reception. Minutes drive to the airport and the Meek and Greet is very efficient. Great price for one night stay and meet and greet. I'll use this service again. </DOC> Had a family room, which was a fantastic size and my teenage son appreciated having a proper bed. It was very quiet too, which was good as we had an early flight booked abroad. Did not have breakfast as it was too early. Staff helpful on reception. It is the usual premier inn style but I have not complaints and it was cleaned to a good standard, with decent towels. Only a short drive (3-5 mins) to Terminal 1 so was a great location. </DOC> Booked as part of a parking/stay package via Holiday Extras, have stayed before a few years ago so knew what to expect although the \u00a310 parking charge is new and a bit of a rip off! We arrived about 11:45pm after a return flight and I\u2019d already messaged and asked them for a room in the quiet zone (5th floor) so we weren\u2019t disturbed in the morning. Room 503 was great, large, clean and quiet....had breakfast on site...\u00a38.99 each all you can eat buffet and it was very good and we definitely got our money\u2019s worth! Another good stay but \u00a310 to park is a bit steep! </DOC> So, we had the usual \"What do we do about car parking\" when flying off to Tenerife for 10 days. In the end, we found this Premier Inn which offered meet & greet parking for the duration of our holiday included in the hotel price. I think we paid \u00a3111 for a night for 3 of us plus parking for the duration. The room was the usual Premier Inn standards, free wifi for 30 minutes and this site had showers only in the rooms but that was roomy and fine. Efficient check-in, plenty of car parking and less than 10 minutes drive to the airport in the morning where we went to the meet & greet car park, dropped the car off and walked a couple of hundred yards to the airport check-in. Great service, friendly staff and would certainly consider using again in the future. </DOC> The title says it all, always good service, beds and bedrooms . Always use Premier Inns if available. Taxi booked to airport by front desk arrived promptly.Just struggle to get to 200 words form this review.If not been to a Premier Inn before. Try it ,ROB",

        "docs": "Checked in night before early flight and used the deal with Jetparks 1. Had to pay \u00a35 for overnight parking at hotel then took car to jetparks one in morning. The hotel doesnt do alarm calls which is silly because it would be so easy to set up on TV or phone and when you are running an airport hotel seems ridiculous. Check in was quick and efficient. Room was the usual set up, we had a lovely nights sleep annd it was really peaceful. Spotlessly clean with nice shower. Would stay again. </DOC> We have stayed here before and there is no doubt it is good value, clean tidy accommodation for those flying out from the airport as its only a 5 minute drive away. This time though we were in a room which overlooked the M56 and there was a constant drone of traffic even with the window closed. Also there is a light problem with a great deal of it coming under the door and also a green Health and Safety light next to the sink, which incidentally is in the bedroom not the bathroom for some reason making it difficult to sleep. Also whilst its good value you have to pay \u00a35 to park overnight at the hotel you are staying at, getting a bit like a real budget hotel. The food and drink are expensive as well because you are a captive audience. </DOC> Located within easy reach of motorway and of car rental village. Charge for parking costs \u00a310 per night. It was a very busy period when we stayed and we were concerned at the length of the queue at the reception but check-in was handled speedily and efficiently by two very pleasant staff members. We had a ground-floor room which was comfortable though chilly but once the heater had kicked in, we were cosy. Not the usual Premier Inn set up since this hotel had been acquired from another company. Friendly bar staff one of whom gave me a print-out of directions to the car rental village for the next morning even though she was extremely busy. We were seated quickly in the restaurant, dinner was delicious and service was speedy. Breakfast next day was excellent. Would use this hotel again should we pass through Manchester Airport. </DOC> Stayed here while working in the area and stay was good. Rooms were clean and comfortable which was good. Had food in the restaurant for breakfast and evening and food was nice with plenty of choice and not that long of wait which was good. Will stay here when in area </DOC> Spent the night here before our holiday,having gone to our table for dinner it took ages to order and even longer to get it on the table seems no sort of system.The food was good need to improve the service </DOC> Managed to get an excellent deal at the hotel with my travel agent through Holiday Extras which included overnight stay, breakfast, parking at Jet Parks and Fastrack through the airport. Pleasant comfortable room, but no air conditioning and it was a very hot night, but a fan had been provided so we had a good nights sleep. Simple hot buffet breakfast, helpful pleasant staff made for a good nights stay </DOC> Stayed 23rd November before our flight the following day. Check In was smooth and easy. Family Room was on the 2nd floor facing the motorway. Had 2 double beds and plenty of space for a Travel cot as well. Very little noise from the motorway but could feel a draft from the window. Slept well with a early alarm set. Breakfast was simple and staff friendly. Had meet and greet included at T2. Easy again. Good Value for Money and will book again no doubt in the future. </DOC> Premier Inn hotels in the UK are excellent as stopover hotels - they have the most important element a long-haul flyer is after - excellent beds providing comfy and relaxing sleep. And chocolate brownie for dinner:) But unlike many other Premier Inns around the UK this one hasn't got free shuttle service to the airport - even thought they can arrange for a taxi at the reduced rate of 6GBP it is worth noting most taxis only take cash - so do have GBP on you. The hotel is about 10mins drive from the airport where there is a train which can take you into city Manchester for 4GBP return (off peak) where you can do a little sightseeing via the local council's free city buses. OVerall good experience.",

When you join the wifi it does push for you to enter the premium service (at a charge) but not really necessary for the average traveller. </DOC> Apparently all the family rooms here face the motorway, which seems like an extremely poor design decision! I suspect we won\u2019t be getting the restful, relaxed start to our holiday we\u2019ve paid for. That said, I\u2019m awarding an extra star for lovely service in the restaurant by trainee Megan! </DOC> Used this hotel as a one nighter before an early flight the next day. Very convenient for airport car parks and airport. Really clean, warm and comfortable. There is a restaurant right next door so no need to have to drive around looking for somewhere to eat. Will use again. </DOC> Stayed prior to flight Quick efficient check in very professional staff. Room clean and comfortable. Only negative... time they upgraded the Televisions...so small for the size of the room. certainly would stay again. </DOC> We have stayed at this hotel a few times and the staff are always polite and the rooms are clean and quiet. If you are having an early flight from Manchester this hotel is perfect. We arrived late and the lady on reception gave us information for a takeout. We didn\u2019t have time for breakfast. </DOC> Stayed here with my wife and two sons before going on holiday. Cant praise it enough. Quick location to Manchester Airport. Great evening meal. Nice selection of bar drinks. Nice breakfast. Pleasant staff. Costa in the lobby of the hotel. My wife said that her steak in the restaurant was the best she has ever eaten in a Premier Inn. Staff really attentive and could not help us enough. Highly recommend. </DOC> Ended up staying after flight canceled and this hotel was chosen and paid for by the airline, Over all the staff were really pleasant, The room was clean with a comfortable bed. There was a few things I noticed that the lift looked dirty and on the floor I stayed it looked like someone had been bashing into the door with a sharp object as it was covered in dents which didn't look good and the other point the restaurant closed at 11pm so when I got into the hotel the only food available was snacks from the vending machine which I am surprised there was not a late food options f such as soup or a sandwich as a lot of the customer would be travellers arriving both really early and really late </DOC> The hotel was exactly the same as the one in Birmingham, even the menu in the restaurant. Probably the restaurant is the high point, being also a little chain restaurant feeling, but quite OK. The rooms are a little run down, you have this budget feeling inside this hotel all the time from check in to check out. Even a budget hotel can look a little fresher.",

You would expect a step up from the Clayton next door but they are very much on a par in my view. That said, the rate I paid is similar to what I have paid in the past for the Clayton. Everything was fine, room, service, food, etc., I had no complaints. </DOC> Breakfast has gone up a level in quality since we stayed last. Service as always is excellent. The bar area seating has been swapped around, not sure it works for me. As always transfer and parking well organised, still our choice for Park & Stay. </DOC> I stayed at this property for the first time at the start of the month and was actually very underwhelmed. I could not heat the room enough and I had several other issues. When logging into the wifi a guest survey appeared and I explained the issues. I had a call about 30 mins later and the issues were rectified a heater was brought to my room and I was impressed at the swift response. I returned to the hotel before departing and I had a faultless stay. This hotel is very close to the Manchester airport and does run a frequent shuttle. I would stay here again. </DOC> Conveniently placed and ideal for park and stay (or indeed stay and park) we left our car there (parked off site) and stayed the night on our return at just after midnight. Large third floor room was quiet and well equipped, with plenty of tea, coffee and water provided. The bathroom with shower over bath is in need of an update, it is rather tired, but functional none the less. Ideal for Manchester fliers at sensible rates, all staff were extremely pleasant and helpful. </DOC> We stay here pre flight and usually have a good stay. Not sure what has changed but the beds are too hard, room not cleaned very well and the bar food was below the usual standard. Asked to change the fries from skinny to fat, found the cost of fries added to the bill. Too tired to make a fuss but disappointed. Staff are always really welcoming and helpful and at least that has not changed. </DOC> Stopped overnight recently due to flying out the next day. Ideal location with plenty of parking. Room was clean, good sized with a decent sized bathroom. Pleasant bar area with good selection of drinks. Staff were very pleasant and helpful when we needed assistance with boarding cards for our flight. Transfers to terminal was so easy and we were picked up on our return within minutes. Cannot fault any aspect of our stay and will be booking again soon for next years trip. </DOC> Overnight Monday stay prior to flight. Efficient check in. Free drinks as IHG Loyalty member. Our double room was on the 3rd floor. Very compact, but with all necessities. Safe, aircon , free Wi-fi, hairdryer, iron & board, coffee & tea, fridge (unstocked), flatscreen TV. Small bathroom with full-size bath & shower, good towels. Clean, comfy bed. Quiet. Ate in bar which was adequate. Usual overpriced fare & drinks. Courtesy bus was efficient, sadly we got a miserable driver. Good stay Though, would return </DOC> I've stayed here several times for the night before or after a flight and always found the staff to be friendly & professional, the room absolutely fine (ok some are a bit small, but this isn't a 'destination hotel') and a free shuttle bus to the airport terminal. I've generally always been able to find a good deal for a 'Park & Stay' which works out far cheaper and more convenient than other airport parking offerings. Breakfast is good, but the only other meal I've taken here was a room service pizza late one night, which was very small & disappointing.",

Bathroom modern, hotel check in was quick along with parking car and leaving it whilst away. Bar prices are normal hotel prices. Free wifi whilst in the hotel. Can't comment on food as we arrived late so just had a few drinks before bed and up early to get to the airport. The reception call a free shuttle to take you to the airport, they also pick you up on return aswell which was great. Car was sat waiting for us upon return. Would stay here again as was really convenient for the airport. </DOC> Stayed here again before a morning flight, stayed here many times and would not stay anywhere else when flying out of Manchester. Had the breakfast this time and it was lovely, well worth having if you have time. Clean, friendly and a lovely pub/bar for a couple at night. </DOC> After navigating the small roundabouts, eventually found the crown plaza and found a space near the reception. Parking Eye controls the car park, so you need to log your car registration at reception. Friendly welcome from guest service desk and taken to the business reception lobby. Met by a Sunny, who throughout the day was a credit to the Crowne Plaza brand. From the room, to the snacks and gorgeous lunch, this was an exemplary day. The only thing missing was a tuck shop like the one, they have in Heathrow. Thank you guys, the whole experience of the client is vastly improved by having such a great venue </DOC> Found this hotel to be good value for money, free transfer from the terminal to the hotel... (if you call the hotel on arrival) i decided to walk because of the good weather and short distance. though. Check in was ok, friendly staff and first impression of the room was ok. Room was clean, bed could have been better, breakfast was ok, nothing special just designed for travelers. I had dinner in the \"Asian\" restaurant twice, again nothing special the taste was like the typical European style Asian. So don't expect any spicy food. The pub was ok, friendly staff and nice beers from the draft. The hotel offers everything you would expect from an airport hotel, it's a good place to stay and i would definitely stay here again next time. </DOC> Staying prior to flying out on holiday. Booked in around 4pm given room. Long walk to find it had not been seriviced. Bed unmade Used Towels. rang reception & were eventually directed to another room. Did receive a drinks voucher for the wife & I. Still hassle we could do without. Stayed 2 weeks later back from holiday. Excellent Airport shuttle. Had trouble printing Boarding cards next day but helped with great service from Sunny, I think a Guest Relations manager. If not he should be!!! Hotel a little tired. bathrooms need to be upgraded to showers. Still not convinced by single duvet bedding. prefer layers. </DOC> Did the 15 day park and stay with club room option (again!). Still great, still love the club room, staff still friendly and professional. We did do something different this time though, club room for breakie which was a continental option which was more than enough to satisfy. Back again next month. Would still recommend. </DOC> Overnight stay before early flight. We upgraded to an Executive room with salon access which was very nice. Typical Crowne Plaza rooms. Very clean, nice bathroom. The Executive lounge was very small but the service was excellent. The aperitifs just kept flowing. The lady managing it was very kind. Will go back. The only problem is the very steep parking fees for an overnight stay. </DOC> Another year another holiday stay. Best place to stay at the airport. This is our 5th stay in as many years. We love everything about the place. The staff are always wonderful and the shuttle service on departure and arrival is always quick. Worth paying the extra for the 'Club' suite as it just makes you first night on holiday even more special",

The reception was good well staffed and quick with check in. the room was good with a welcome upgrade that makes a difference. bed was reasonable and all you needed was in the room. You expect some noise and disturbance from other guests and the airport however this was good and one of the better airport hotels I have stopped in for noise. Bar was expensive as you are captive customer as is the food cost for quality received but you expect or tolerate it don't know which..... </DOC> We stayed here only because we paid mostly with our reward points. Pre flight stay on room only basis. First issue was parking. Car park was full and because some inconsiderate drivers parked on the access drive through to additional parking we had no option but to park in a disabled bay which the hotel were ok with. We were told we had a free upgrade but what that was is beyond me. The room was pretty average sized with small double bed. Right opposite the end of the runway with glazing far too inadequate to give us some much needed sleep. On top of this \u00a315 to park is in my opinion ludicrous. Would not stay here again and so glad we didn't pay full price. Far better options within a couple of miles. </DOC> We have been staying here for years. With a few exceptions our stays have been wonderful. This time was no exception. Everything we asked for was provided with a smile. We arrived a few minutes early and were treated to a complimentary drink at the bar while we waited but a few minutes for the room to be completed. How nice is that! The room was perfect. The staff were all friendly and helpful. Great location. Reliable free continuous shuttle to airport with nice drivers. What more could you want!. </DOC> Third or fourth time I\u2019ve stayed here after a long flight. Comfortable and quiet room. Very nice check in and out. Good service at the bar too. Bar dinner and breakfast were good and good value. Only minor point is the bathroom - bit small plus shower flooded the room. But I will certainly continue to stay there - goid value and nice people. </DOC> As we headed toward reception I expected the usual bland welcome from a busy airport hotel however from the reception to the restaurant to the exec lounge to the shuttle bus drivers everyone was very pleasant ,warm and friendly. The room was comfortable, the exec lounge was worth the extra money ( young chap serving was very professional). The car was taken off site 2 miles but was there on our return. In all would use again. A positive experience. </DOC> Stayed before an early morning flight and the deal (APH) included car parking. Absolutely no problems at all, Check in prompt ground floor room. Had a meal in the Grill, all staff very pleasant indeed. The early morning courtesy bus very prompt, When we arrived back the courtesy bus prompt, when we arrived at the hotel the car was waiting for us. I would heartily recommend this hotel for any early morning flight start. Will stay again. Excellent service through out. </DOC> Have used this hotel before for an early morning flight. Swift check in choice of rooms offered, very pleasant staff on the desk, Room comfortable everything you would need for an overnight stay, beds extremely good. towels plentiful and lots of toiletries. Had a meal in the restaurant, good and plentiful, staff very efficient. All in all a good stay plus excellent parking for 8 days. Quick transport to the terminal and also back when we returned. Would gladly recommend and will definitely use again another great stay. </DOC> Booked one nights stay with 15 days parking, arrived at hotel and was told there was only 3 car spots available and to go find one he wasn't sure my car would fit any of the spots because of the size, but after driving round some one was leaving so I nipped in the vacant spot . I watched the bellew/hay boxing match in the Irish bar down stairs it was extremely busy but the staff in there work very hard . We had a decent nights sleep When we left very early the next morning i noticed people were eating breakfast even at 5am . The mini bus drivers who took us to the terminal was a very pleasent chaps it only takes two mins . On return it was a quick pick up collected car keys and off .",

Staff were friendly and helpful,shuttle bus driver was great and we were dropped off and picked up with no hassle.Cant fault CP or its staff and the service it delivers..will of course book again . </DOC> We were flying to Montenegro and decided not to travel through the night. Crowne Plaza was 2 mins from T1. We were welcomed as Gold Elite guests and shown to our room. Very comfy I had a good nights sleep till early alarm 4.15 am. Despite the early hour breakfast was excellent and with parking car included overall very good value </DOC> We stayed in two different rooms on two nights on our way to and from our holiday. Our overall experience was heavily influenced by the fact that the beds were the most uncomfortable beds we have come across in an hotel - quite small bed, thin mattress and an ultra-thin mattress topper (it was the thickness of a sheet!). A real pity because there are so many other good features about this hotel - very friendly staff (particularly the shuttle bus drivers), good breakfast buffet, good evening meal and a reasonably quiet noise level (given its location beside the airport). Please management, put in some decent beds! </DOC> Had a lovely stay here before flying to Maderia parking was painless Reception very efficient the room very clean with all you could need worked well for us, we had a couple of drinks in the Bar and a tasty meal in the Grill Restaurant before turning in for sleep which was very good.

Also a Pan Asian restaurant there which we have tried again very good see you soon Crowne Plaza </DOC> As a regular user of this hotel for the Park Stay and Go, I am not happy with the new system of checking in, then taking my car to a different location, I always thought the Crowne Plaza was all about service and if this is the new way to do things I might as well use any hotel and park the car in a secure car park. It also seems that being a Gold Points Member counts for nothing either, we used to get the lounge access for free, this is no longer the case, I would suggest that if the Management of this hotel wants to keep its regular customers it thinks seriously about it customer service. </DOC> This is by far the most worn down Crowne Plaza I have stayed at. Common areas are dirty, ripped carpets fixed with duct tape etc. For \u00a3149 per night in a single room, I expect far more than this. Breakfast was decent and the free shuttle service to and from the terminals is excellent. </DOC> This place is all about location. We had a really early flight so thought we may as well stay the night before. Despite the reviews, check in was really easy and quick, a quick beer in the bar and up to the room. The walkways on each floor are dark n dingy and straight out of the 1980\u2019s but the room was fine, bed comfy and all round clean, just dated hence the average mark, nothing special. The transfer at 4:45 the next morning was superb despite my reservations as it was so early and you can\u2019t book it, your to,d just to turn up and the driver would be there within 5-10 minutes, and like magic he was. Incredibly pleasant and insistent he lifted our bags on and off - excellent. All round the hotel was fine but nothing outstanding either, but I would certainly use again.",

Cost \u00a385 with no breakfast as too early a start to even bother... but better still a 5 min. run via their bus to the terminal.

They do have a minibus to pick you up and transfer you back to hotel and the driver was incredibly helpful, informative etc. It was efficient although it took us a while standing at the bus stop to realise you needed to phone the hotel to get collected! Reception efficient too but would not stay ever again as it was like a cupboard. </DOC> This is a great place to stay if flying from Manchester. Reception could not have been more helpful and our car was taken care of for our time away. Our room was comfortable and we had a good night's sleep before flying. In between we had a refreshing drink in the b ar - again helpful and pleasant staff before eating at Sampans, an oriental restaurant with largely Thai and Chinese dishes. All very good and tasty. Finally, we had a convenient lift to the terminal in a hotel minibus. </DOC> I recently stayed with Family before our flight to Cyprus. We had 2 club rooms and these were as expected, no problems. Food in the bar was good as was Breakfast the next day. I parked my car for 15 nights, the car being moved off site and returned for us on our arrival back to the UK. This is where things went wrong. We returned home a day early and I'd contacted the hotel 4 days prior to let them know we would be requiring the car 24 hours before originally planned. This was all confirmed as being arranged. Unfortunately when we arrived at the Hotel at 3am my car had not been returned. It was after 4am that i got the car, not ideal at that time in the morning. I'm due to park and stay here again next winter, this may have put me off. </DOC> Stayed one night prior to early morning flight, staff very helpful & friendly,good deal for car parking and the club room was an excellent bonus.... 2 hours of drinks & canap\u00e9s with great service.will definitely use again </DOC> Polite, helpful staff at check in. Good sized, king sized comfortable beds, toiletries provided, bottled water, fridge, and overall comfortable rooms. The bars are expensive! We stayed the night before we flew and also parked there for 15 days, we then stayed the night we landed back in the uk. Our first room was on the ground floor and was lovely, clean and quiet but our returning room was on the 4th floor, noisy, dusty and had a bathroom which as in need of a refurb.",

        "docs": "Have stayed here a few times now and as we book direct we were given a 10% discount on our reservation. When we arrived last week we were given an upgrade to a suite type room, a voucher for a free drink each and a further 10% off any secondary spend. The staff were friendly and efficient, the room clean, large and comfy. Dinner and breakfast were fine. All in all it beat driving up early morning and we felt we had started our holiday a day early. </DOC> Excellent Hotel. Booked the stay & car parking package. Couldn't be simpler. Make a note of your milage before booking in, it will save you another trip out to the car. Room was near reception a little small, but no noise noted. All the usual facilities one expects. Good bed. Staff were efficient and friendly. Transfer to the airport fine, but a 200m walk to the terminal. Return was the same - ring for pick up after going through customs. Ate in the bar - a bit pricey for 2 burgers & 2 drinks \u00a344. Quality OK. </DOC> Stayed at the Crowne plaza for a quick business trip. The hotel is in the airport complex and offers a very user friendly on-demand shuttle. Check in was very impersonal and not very pleasant. The rooms are small and very basic, but functional, comfortable, and clean. Good soundproofing and blackout shades. Great free wifi. Overall very good value. </DOC> We stayed here at beginning and end of short break and have stayed here before.our views remain much the same .this is an expensive hotel but this us offset by the brilliant staff and the super convenient shuttle.the food is of good quality but also a little pricey.why we don't give 5 stars is everytime we stay here we have been woken not only by guests but also cleaning staff.why do they have to start at630 ? Also every room we have stayed in is not large enough to comfortably accommodate two suitcases. Still 4 stars however </DOC> Stayed for one night before holiday. Staff great. Pub good and restaurant too. Helpful and friendly staff. We did not fancy restaurant menu but staff let us eat in restaurant off bar menu. Great room. Clean and modern with left bed and pillows. Used twice and will use again. Check in and out quick and efficient. </DOC> My wife stayed here last night with our daughter and she had a meal and a kids meal, that she had to pay for. IHG advertise that kids eat free in all of their hotels. I phoned today to be told it no longer applies at the hotel and does not apply at all hotels, I think the IHG group need to be more clear about which of their hotels and which don't. </DOC> I have been a regular at the Hilton Manchester Airport hotel for a number of years and have been greatly disappointed every time I stayed there. It was time for a change and I am glad I did. Super friendly staff at check-in, they acknowledged my gold status and I got a complimentary upgrade(neither happened at that other hotel). A few dining options on the premises ranging from Oriental, steakhouse, pub grub and a sports bar. Friendly staff throughout. The rooms as such perfectly fine. Small bathroom but fully functional for a guy. </DOC> We booked the crowne plaza for the night before our flight and we left our car there as well. Good price for room only plus car parking. The room inc bathroom was a little dated and could do with a refurbishment. We had a drink in the bar prices were great and the service was good. The transport to the airport took about 5 - 10 minutes. Great return picking up our car when arrived back in the uk.",

        "docs": "Stayed for one night between flights. We arrived at T3 and it was an easy if convoluted walk to the hotel although there is a shuttle bus for those with lots of luggage. We departed from T2 which is further away but under 10 minutes walk. In the end we used the hotel shuttle which at 04.00 consisted of only us and the friendly driver was keen to take us. Check in was efficient, room was small but clean, well equiped and temperature was easily controlled, Bed was comfy and we heard no noise during the night. We ate at the restaurant, food was excellent and the staff very enthusiastic and quick with the service. Prices were normal for airport locations. All in all a good option for a stay at Manchester airport . </DOC> This is a good hotel for a one nights stay.Bed comfortable room in a quite position.Staff friendly, courtesy bus good.We ate before we arrived here in Alderley Edge which works out a lot cheaper. The car only did the stated 4 mile as per contract, but it is the state it comes back in, Filthy the same as the last time we parked here, I am having reservations about parking here again. </DOC> Good option for stay and car parking. Rooms small, but ok for one night. No where to put luggage but on the floor. Dinner in the Thai restaurant was good but expensive. The Irish bar was smelly and depressing. Shuttle bus to airport quick and efficient. Would definitely use again at the right price. </DOC> I felt somewhat let down by this hotel. I know airport hotels tend to get away with murder as customers are in a holiday mood and not paying too much attention to what is on offer. We had a 'family room' for myself and my two teenage sons. This turned out to be a tiny, shabby and poorly appointed room. There was a double bed and a laughably uncomfortable camp bed. Nice... The only saving grace is the proximity to Terminal 3. Anyone taking the courtesy coach needs a severe talking to as it is literally a 5 minute walk. Someone needs to have a word with IHG. Take down the 'Crowne Plaza' livery and replace with 'Holiday Inn Express'. That would seem reasonable.....just. </DOC> I stayed two time one night in some days and have to state that the hotel didn't keep the promises. The stuff is not friendly and the rooms have need of refurbishments as they are old fashioned. Next time I travel via Manchester Airport I'll chose a different solution again. </DOC> Did not stay in the hotel but visited this bar for food. Both Sean & Dominik were helpful and sorted out my allergy requirements . Decent food at reasonable prices. Pleasant atmosphere and good screens available to watch any football on. </DOC> Over the years we've stayed at most of the better hotels around Manchester Airport and have found the Crowne Plaza to be THE best! It's in a great location near T1 - you could almost walk to it - and has a great Stay & Park facility where one can stay and leave your car for the duration of your trip. The rooms may not be the biggest, but they're more than comfortable, although like most hotels these days way too warm - even in February!! Bathrooms are more than adequate and have all one would need for a stay. The staff are all excellent, throughout, warm, friendly, polite but always professional. We always dine in Sampans restaurant, one of the nicest pan Asian restaurants anywhere! Can't see anything making us go anywhere else other than the CP if flying out of Manchester!! 10 out of 10 every time! </DOC> This hotel is very good and handy to the airport. There is a number of courtesy buses to ferry you to and from the airport, which, given the busyness of the area, is a real godsend. The d\u00e9cor of the public spaces needs some TLC but the rooms are fine. Will use it again purely for the courtesy buses.",

        "docs": "Just love The Crowne Plaza at Manchester airport. You are made to feel really welcome as soon as you go in the front door. Our room was spotless, lovely crisp white bedding and huge bed. Very comfy too. We had few drinks and then went into the bar for food. My husband had steak and it was cooked to perfection, I had the fish and chips , it was delicious. You also get a complimentary taxi in the morning to take you to the airport. We would book again every time before we go on holiday. </DOC> It is hard to judge \"value for money\" in a hotel where the price is so volatile. We paid 170\u00a3 a night which is too much. Room and breakfast is up to standard so if you get a great deal, go for it. If not you might want to try another option. </DOC> Stayed over before a god o\u2019clock check in to Amsterdam. Excellent check in polite and friendly staff. I went the sports bar for a bite to eat! Reasonably priced too! I had the burger it was nice considering it\u2019s hotel food. Room on ground floor was lovely very comfortable and clean with lots of hot water. Also a 24 hr minibus to take you to your terminal. Highly recommended </DOC> Ideal position for Manchester airport. Comfortable bed, a little airport noise but ok. Need to be down early for transfer as lots use this and the mini bus takes only 8 at a time. Easy check in and pleasant staff </DOC> We stayed her the night before an early flight and especially if youre at T3, it's probably quicker to walk than use the free bus if it's not there when you leave the hotel - its that close. Infact it might take longer to walk to reception from your room as some rooms are right at the end of a long winding corridor - luckily ours wasnt too far. The rooms are great, not quite up to Radisson Blu airport standards and sizes, but almost. A decent bed, blackout curtains, very quiet and a good bathroom. We managed to use airline miles for our room, but often the Plaza is one of the best priced anyway. Plus it has an excellent Asian fusion restaurant. A perfect stay. </DOC> Just wanted a nice relaxing stay before flight. Way check-in my ihg status recognised. The room was great for the one night and the sleep spray helped me sleep. Breakfast buffet fine and easy transfer to terminal with friendly and helpful driver. Happy to stay again when I need to.. </DOC> I used to use this hotel regularly in the early 2000\u2019s but this was my first time back for about 7 years. Some of the staff remembered me from previous years which was lovely and they made me feel welcome. I was recognised as a platinum member and I got a free drink from the bar but I never got offered a room upgrade which was disappointing. Nothing much has changed since I last stayed so the actual place has become a bit tired and that includes the room I was allocated. The bathroom smelled of damp and the air conditioning was poor making the room hot and stuffy. I ate in Sampans and it was ok but not as good as it used to be. The bar staff were great and Michaela was lovely as always. Breakfast was reasonable if a bit cold but decent quality. All in all a reasonable return to an old friend. </DOC> Still the only UK hotel in the ihg chain where I have yet to be upgraded There are rooms available so that excuse wears thin, the room I have is best described as average I know it's picky but just the way I feel about this hotel as a platinum member Have used this many times in past but now going to use either the express or better still the Hilton The Hilton gives a gold card upgrade every time",

The rooms are a nice size and whilst the bathrooms are well stocked with lotions and potions I do find the Bathrooms and little small. The Thai restaurant on the ground floor is excellent although quite expensive. If I was being super critical I would asked that they put all of the Freeview channels on the room TV because they are free after all so why so few channels? </DOC> Stayed overnight before an earlyish flight the day after. Found it easy to park, reception were knowledgable and very helpful. Room allowed a full night's sleep evensong close to airport. Very clean throughout and enjoyed the breakfast. We will use again. </DOC> Some difficulties in getting through to Reception when trying to clarify arrangements for leaving luggage on our park and stay option and also when trying to call the shuttle bus ( although we had some fault in this ). Clean and well situated; disappointed with the Grill Restaurant. </DOC> Reception friendly quick and communicative .. Chinese man made you feel welcome ... cudos yo him The room was clean with normal good bed .. cramped with the placing of silly lounger Bathroom small but fine Club lounge overcrowded and too small waitress good though The Grill for dinner is ok .. food acceptable service a little chaotic .. breakfast average at best. Close to airport with good shuttle service </DOC> Stayed 1 x night with parking for a week. Car park was fairly full when we arrived at 9.45pm but eventually found a space. Room and bar were both good. Reasonably quiet overnight as facing the (distant) main road. Shuttle bus runs very regularly to T1 IHG rewards night was a bonus too </DOC> We booked it as a mystery hotel through Holiday Extra's and ended up getting it for \u00a330.00 cheaper. Struggled to find a parking space when we got there as the car park was literally overflowing. Other than that the hotel was as good as always, free water bottles in the room , ample storage and electric sockets, great bathroom lighting. My only complaint was it was so hot and the air con did't seem to be working, all the hotel windows were open so I think everyone else had the same problem </DOC> Stayed here as our flight was delayed for 24 hours. The room is very small but comfy beds. Clean and pleasant room. Bathroom is dated (still has a bath with shower over head) Views from room, there isn't one. Breakfast was good and hot. Bar area has a nice atmosphere. </DOC> Handy location near to T1 and shuttle bus provided by telephone call from info desk at arrival hall. 10 minute wait for bus and straight to hotel via airport one way system. Friendly welcome and upgrade to a club room but no access to club lounge. Declined breakfast add on at \u00a317 each. Comfy room and a good nights sleep after a quick dinner in hotel restaurant. Bathroom a bit small but manageable for one night, well lit. Did not take breakfast next day and managed short walk to terminal missing one way road system in the shuttle bus!",

        "docs": "The good side: staff were always pleasant and willing to help. Bed was comfortable. Food at breakfast was extensive offering hot and continental options. That's where it stops: the R'Yves main hotel restaurant only offered a limited menu, the same for lunch and dinner so after more than one day a little tedious. The rooms are tired, shower leaked, horrible noisy air conditioning that (despite appearances) had only one setting and one temperature, leaving me waking with a stuffy head. 15 mins out of town so not exactly \"central\". Meeting rooms are dingy. Wifi signal non existent. Won't rush back! </DOC> This is our fourth stay at this hotel and it just keep getting better. The staff is excellent, so helpful and proud of the job they do and their hotel. Rooms are big, huge by Paris standards, clean, quiet and comfortable. The location is superb; a block from the number 6 metro. Far from the craziness of the tourist areas. Lots of great restaurants in the immediate area. And, a great breakfast every morning. Just a perfect stay. Highly recommended </DOC> I have stayed in great and awful hotels under the Marriott name, which is disconcerting because it means I can't trust it as a brand name. This one is in the middle - good basics such as comfortable beds in sound-proofed rooms, and good food... but a soulless ambience and a general air of neglect - mould in bathroom, broken polystyrene ceiling tiles, worn carpets etc.. </DOC> I keep going to this hotel as it is in walking distance from Denfert-Rocherau RER station which I find really convenient when flying in. It is also a bit away from the touristy areas and if you are lucky, you get a room with a nice view to Sacre Coeur. The rooms are starting to look a bit dated but I still find them ok. There is a fitness room overlooking the main road with enough equipment to keep you busy. Metro station is 5 minutes walk away. Staff was very friendly and helpful, breakfast hours were generous and I had a really nice stay. If you are a bit of a walker, you could take a stroll to the Louvre, it took me about 45 minutes and you get to see a lot of interesting neighbourhoods. </DOC> Big hotel in downtown Paris - not located in the most touristic or historical part of the city and Boulevard St Jacques is definitively not the most romantic or sexy avenue in Paris, because of the airway metro just in front of the hotel - but because of this location, the hotel is huge - and rooms are quite large for Paris. Apart from that, well this is typically an hotel for large tourist-groups or business groups, probably less for romance. However, service, staff, meet the current Marriott standards - typically it's convenient (metro nearby and walking distance to historical spots), clean and professional. </DOC> Recently stayed in this hotel with my family on vacation. The staff was very welcoming and kind. They went out of their way to make our visit as good as possible. We had two rooms, one Jr suite which was basically two rooms combined with a wall knocked out between them and the other an exec room, king. The Jr. suite had a king and a full size pull out which was nice. Also had two full baths. AC worked well as did wifi. Easy walk from hotel to metro stations, Glacier or Saint Jacques. I would stay here again, no question. Good location for families, local Italian cafes close by. Also very good breakfast with many options. </DOC> I was immediately greeted by Tonia very pleasant lady who was able to get me into a room right away and after a 10hr flight from US that was very well appreciated. The room was a nice size, toilet area was a little tight but that may be normal in Paris as I noticed a lot of smaller things. My tub was clogged. I didn\u2019t enjoy the shower because the water was filled to my ankles. We ordered room service one night and it was good. The room attendant finally cleaned my room after catching her in the hallway. Overall nice stay many attractions where about 15-20 min Uber ride away </DOC> Quite a large hotel, next to many travel options. The rooms are well appointed as you would expect at a marriott - may a little outdated. The service is particularly friendly. The fitness is rather large. The restaurant is ok, without many options however. On the other had, the cafe is very practical and offers quite some options.",

The room itself was clean and comfortable, with a decent view over Paris. The shower was temperamental though, but just about did the job. Public areas and the bar were excellent. </DOC> Stayed five nights with my family. We had two rooms one a suite the other a regular room. Both were very clean and well appointed. Had one small issue at check in as it is a conference hotel and they were full. The management quickly jumped in and solved the issue. Had zero effect on our enjoyment of the property. The rooms were quiet and we did not experience any of the issues claimed in other reviews. Had breakfast in the executive lounge and enjoyed it very much. The staff was very friendly and always willing to help. The hotel is not in the middle of the hustle and bustle and out of the way which is a good thing. Metro, RER, cab and Uber are all easy to get to. I have stayed here multiple times over the years and will definitely stay here again given the opportunity. </DOC> over the years, this has become our place to stay when in Paris, and it never disappoints. Huge thanks to Mr. Jam, who took care of our room assignment and set it up the way we needed it. The view from the hotel room was superb. The room was beautiful, with all the amenities needed. Thanks to front desk supervisor Sandrine and front desk agent Matthew, who helped resolve small problem we encountered right away. Great executive lounge with good food and fantastic service (Luis, Ike, Judith, Dhorta). Breakfast in the restaurant is a treat with great variety and quality of food and great service (Frederic and Eugenie). can't wait till our next stay. </DOC> Very comfortable, safe, clean but this is a huge faceless conference hotel that could be anywhere in the world! Although it did not interfere with us this hotel attracts flight crew and coach trips. Although dear enough to stay here it is considerably cheaper than more central hotels which is a huge consideration. There is a direct metro, train and bus link to the city all within a few minutes walk and only 2 euro each trip. A taxi will cost you circa 15 - 17 euro although beware only take a taxi with a meter otherwise you will get ripped off. Rooms were adequate, the beds were comfortable and everything worked. Breakfast was very good. Staff were plentiful and very helpful and professional at all times. </DOC> This hotel is terribly dated with minimum Platinum Elite benefits. The rooms are small with low dealings and even smaller bathrooms. As a Platinum member I received no room upgrade and the room was not ready when I arrived at 1330, in spite of the fact that I had requested a 1300 checkin when I checked in online. The Executive Club Lounge was closed the whole weekend which was very disappointing as this one of the reasons we booked a Marriott. No drinks vouchers were offered. </DOC> We stayed here for a conference at the Paris convention centre. Metro very nearby and the surrounding area around hotel seemed safe even if you coming back late at night. Check in was smooth. WiFi works well and is quite fast. Breakfast is well stocked and good variety but would like to see a change of menu occasionally. Rooms were spacious but having the toilet and bathroom separate is nice but the toilet is extremely cramped. Sleep quality was good. </DOC> A little out of the way but very well served by a metro stop. Hotel was nice, rooms were OK. Exec lounge was busy but had a good breakfast a few nice beers and wines in the evening before heading out. Busy with tourists. </DOC> My family stayed here a few days and enjoyed the service and amenities. Great views form the higher floors and some nice restaurants close by.

We were able to get good food, service and have a little time in the city. Overall a good experience. </DOC> Sorely in need of upgrades, and some corridors were being repainted, but broken elevator indicators, stains on bathtubs etc, all point to a need for renovation. Stayed 3 nights as part of conference, the property evidently appealed to large groups. Not counting the business conference, there were tour groups from Insight, Gate1 and others. Very convenient to have a lounge, which is better than the Marriott on Champs Elysee where there was no lounge. Hotel staff all very good despite the tired property. If you\u2019re rewards member, weekend breakfast is served on the 2nd floor instead of the lounge and the selection was very good. Can\u2019t say the location was ideal but perhaps that\u2019s why rates were lower. Conveniently close to Glacier subway station. </DOC> The hotel was clean, access to the Metro just up the road, also buses at the top of the road. Reasonable walk to some sites. Nice breakfast,breakfast room needs a bit of a thorough clean, staff in coffee shop and bars not always available </DOC> Not close to Seine and main attractions but close to Metro to get to them. Friendly enough staff but slow to act. Here with Gate 1 so didn\u2019t have a choice. I would not return here given a choice. Too many other good hotels at fair prices. (See highly rated TA hotels.) </DOC> Stayed only one night but happy to move on - perhaps we had been spoilt by the peace & ambience of the country hotels of the past week. Clearly a popular business hotel but we weren't on business. The room was clean & comfortable enough, the bathroom bright & modern with a shower that didn't splash all over the floor as it did in most of the country hotels. The bed was comfortable. My only real gripe was the hallway to our room & the lobby area on our level was musty & the carpets clearly in need of a good steam clean or better still, replacement. </DOC> Stayed at the hotel for MPLS World Congress. Very good hotel. Nice rooms with city views, food is quite good and the executive lounge is spacious and well lit... The Starbucks in the lobby is an added bonus. </DOC> Small but comfortable room with all amenities. Short walk to Metro and a decent range of cafes. Good buffet breakfast.

Room acoustics are no good either, since we could hear our overhead neighbors every night. Everything is old. Breakfast is mediocre in quality and diversity. The telephone woke us up one day at 6AM and then they banged on our door because someone had ordered room service breakfast and they got the wrong room. Talk abou disorganization... The room maid was horrible. She forgot on several days to replace toilet paper and even tried to convince us to clean the room before we left! There are, however, a few good things: hotel is near to a subway station, the rooms are spacious and the lounge allows you to print your boarding pass, for example. But overall, not good and certainly not worth the price. </DOC> This is a typical large conference hotel situated some 10 minutes from the Metro. A bit worn down but otherwise pretty ok. You have to be a member to get free wifi. Very old-fashioned! Breakfast is good but over-priced. The staff is \"correct\" but not very friendly. The hotel is ok for a conference but I would not stay here visiting Paris as a tourist. </DOC> Stayed here for 3 nights for a conference. A bit like a 1980's Marriott. Rooms not refurbished but large for a city. Well located near the metro, but not really much good for walking anywhere touristy. Service in the conference area was good to very good, but one night we ate in the restaurant, and they got my order wrong, and then blamed me for it. Consequently I got the steak I ordered after everyone else had finished, with the barest apology. Wrote all this in my feedback to the hotel, but no acknowledgement or reply so far (2 weeks) </DOC> Pros: Very nice rooms. Big comfy beds, good city views. Nice breakfast, good coffee. In a business conference here, they had relatively nice function rooms at the basement area. Location is near the subway green line. Cons: Small Toilet ( cramped room ). It is separate from the bathroom. Small lobby for a conference hotel. </DOC> Nice Marriott located close to the Metro and RER makes getting around easy. The lobby and restaurant areas are very nice and a nice bae tucked behind the restaurant proper offers a wide array of bourbon. The restaurant is open late so if you need an after work meal it works fine. Rooms are your typical Marriott and good size for Paris. There is an Executive lounge with complimentary breakfast tea and wine and beer in evening definitely worth the upgrade. We found a couple of nice restaurants within walking distance. The staff was friendly and the rooms kept clean though not a new hotel. The conference center location does not impact the other hotel guests which is nice. They keep lots of security in lobby area so feels very safe. </DOC> On arrival I was told my room had been cancelled! Not sure if this was the fault of Marriott hotels or Booking.com, but it was a pretty poor start. I eventually got a room, but next to the service elevator (I assume), because the noise kept me awake all night! Breakfast service was pretty poor, was stopped from getting my own coffee but then had to ask three times, before one arrived </DOC> We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Marriott while in Paris. It is very conveniently located close to many of the must see attractions in the city. The staff was very friendly and efficient and most spoke English. The accommodations were quite comfortable and the food was excellent. </DOC> Every aspect of our stay met our expectations. The room was comfortable and typical Marriott. The hotel is not is the tourist district but is very close to the Glacier metro stop making it convenient to visit the city. The breakfast in the restaurant is adequate. The quality is good, but the breakfast is not memorable. The area where this hotel shines is it's concierge lounge. The lounge is staffed by 2 wonderful staff members, Luz and Louis. Both are very welcoming and efficient. The evening offerings were excellent and changed daily. Luis took great care of us and meeting him was the highlight of our stay. We will stay at the Marriott next year for our meetings.",

Breakfast is good, too. TIP: Find a package deal that includes breakfast. </DOC> We always stay here the night before we fly out on our vacations. It is always clean, the staff is always nice, helpful and professional. The breakfast is good, always good. Beds are comfortable, too. You can often find a good deal that includes breakfast. *We usually find the best deals on their website. </DOC> Located adjacent to terminal 1 and the trains in the Squaire. European sized rooms, slightly smaller than your typical US hotel room. Great beds for a good night\u2019s sleep. A few English news channels on the tube. Restaurant and bar on the premises. The breakfast is real good. However, for dinner I would venture to the opposite side of the Squaire, where they have Italian, German and an Asian restaurant. </DOC> Had a 13.5 hour layover on our way to Iceland. This hotel was the perfect place to rest and find enough time to do a half day Frankfurt city tour. Just 15 minutes to the city center. Hotel is located \"in the airport\", less expensive than the other 2 that are in the same area \"The Squaire\". The train station is also directly under the structure (The Squaire). There's also a Lufthansa check in counter along the walk to the airport so there's no need to drag your luggage all the way to the check in counter at the Departure in the main airport. </DOC> Spent one night here for a flight the following morning and couldn't selected a better place! First, the hotel has a very futuristic design and also adjacent to the Hilton Airport Hotel (literally next door but in same building). You're actually right across the street from the Airport (15 min walk). Room was nice size, comfy beds, lots of outlets to charge devices (both 110 and 240 voltages). Lots of places to eat downstairs and a convenience store w/hot food. Hotel staff very friendly and attentive. Hands down the most convenient choice in/around the Frankfurt Airport! </DOC> Excellent location. Especially if you are doing a rail and flight combo. Just had one over night there alone so that helped. But the check in slow with long queue. My non smoking room reeked of smoke so they changed rooms for me and other only smelled slightly of smoke. The Windows don't open. Which I don't like. Then the bed!!! Was some sort of weird mattress that expelled air when you sit on it. I unplugged bed side radio because I thought it was hissing. Then it caved in to the middle. And the sheets didn't fit and came off But thank goodness it was only one night. Shops down stairs also a win </DOC> Reservation @HiltonHotels Garden Inn in FRA ... all flights and trains are cancelled because of the storm, I just couldn't get there, trust me I tried... so only option I tried to cancel - their reply: we need to charge you 90% as you have to cancel 3 days in advance... But it's a storm ... I know, have a great evening ... This is beyond ridiculous but shows how Hilton appreciates HH guests vs. Revenue optimization. </DOC> Conveniently located with indoor access to airport makes this a good choice if you need to stay close to the airport for some reason. Nice rooms, but rather long hallways, so quite a walk if you, as me, got a room almost at the end. Good breakfast, including omelette offering. Price on the high side.",

        "docs": "The location of the Hilton Garden Inn and the Hilton are ideal for early morning flights. It is a quick ten minute walk to terminal 1. This property is clean and very quiet so it was perfect for getting some rest prior to the flight to the US. Has a small bar and restaurant on site; although the Hilton is also within a one minute walk. Recommend. </DOC> The Hilton Garden Inn Frankfurt Airport is just the place to spend the night before a long flight home the next day. Check in is fast and courteous and nice to be reconized if you have stayed there before. Rooms are clean well maintained and above all quiet and comfortable for a good nights sleep. I also recommend the breakfast buffet, a pretty good bargain if booked in advance with your room reservation. Hotel has a great location within walking distance from terminal 1 via covered walkway. Will definitely recommend. </DOC> - ROOMSERVICE: I ordered steak with pepper sauce. The sauce was nowhere to be seen on my plate. - The binder in my room only had the room service menu in German. And this for an international hotel in an international airport?? - The walk from the airport is not long, but also not short, and not always clearly identified. Note that you have to walk all the way back if you want a taxi in the morning. I found it a quite long walk. - I really hate it when the minibar in the room is empty. It is so frustrating to have to go downstairs for a drink. Please, this is a Hilton, stock the minibar and stop making your guest\u2019s lives so difficult. - The staff at reception was not friendly at check-out. I was not exited about this Hilton. </DOC> The main feature of this hotel is that it is connected to the airport and train station. No shuttle, no taxi. In less than a 10 mns walk you will get from the terminal to the hotel lobby. The hotel is actually located at the Squaire, a fairly new building also hosting offices, a train station as well as a few restaurant and stores. The hotel itself has nothing special. It is very functional, modern and clean. My room was small but comfortable. Internet is free. Staff was efficient. You will find a good array of reasonably priced restaurant in the Squaire, Starbucks and a fully stocked grocery store (Rewe). I normally stay at the Sheraton (even closer to the terminal) but the HGI was equally fine with the added value of free Internet. </DOC> Was expecting more as we have stayed at numerous Hilton hotels but never a Garden Inn. Checked in by an unhelpful person who was in a rush although no guests waiting. Room was tiny and not the room type we reserved. Slippery bathtub. But just one night so we said nothing. Buffet breakfast is 25 Euro per person so we ate elsewhere in airport. Would not go back. </DOC> The hotel is inside the airport. It is about a 15 minute walk from Terminal 1 but doable. The staff is friendly. It is clean and functional. My only complaint is that my room was so small that they put a chair and table between the bed and the window. It is so tight that if there were two people- both would have to get in the same side of the bed!! </DOC> I highly recommend this property for anyone flying into or out of the airport in Frankfurt. It is a great rest stop after a long flight, and is ideally located for catching an early morning flight. The staff is professional and helpful, the property is clean and well maintained. I do suggest skipping the restaurant as it is very over priced. Try Alex's at the opposite end of the complex near the Kewe market. </DOC> I guess the most important thing is that the hotel is connected to Frankfurt airport. Technically, anyway. The bad news - bring your walking shoes. It is a long, long trek from the terminals, up and down elevators and escalators until you finally get there. Did I mention it is a long walk? Wow. Nothing else to say about it, typical Hilton property - cheerful staff, nice cookies, modern amenities, etc. Kind of feels like being in America. Very expensive though.",

        "docs": "I have stayed at this hotel several times before. Unfortunately this time the room allocated for me 10205 was probably very close to some smoking rooms and the smoke nanaged to penetrate the hallway and consequently my room and stick to the linings. It is surprising that hotels like this still allow people to smoke in their rooms. Next time I will ask during check-in for making sure I stay far away from the smokers. </DOC> Located at a walking distance from the main arrival/departure international terminal & also the main hub of Europe rail connectivity , it is quiet a convenient property Adjacent to another Hilton property in the same location , it serves as a good hotel with a decent health club & a restaurant with meeting rooms </DOC> Excellent. A 5-minute walk from the main terminal and right in the middle of the train station. Perfect overnight base to recover after a long-haul flight. It\u2019s a new property and adjoins the Hilton next door. The main benefit to this is that you actually get access to the Hilton facilities; sauna, steam and gym. All are brand new. Room was, as you\u2019d expect from a Garden Inn, functional, clean and more than comfortable. If you are just passing through the airport, need to recover after flying across the globe or need to be up and ready for an early rail or flight departure this one is ideal. </DOC> Note that the hotel is very poorly marked. The address provided by Hilton is just The Squaire - which is not as descriptive as possible - it is in the EAST side. The hotel was nice for an airport hotel. Was dead quiet even though we could see planes overflying the location. </DOC> This hotel is located in the SQUAIRE complex linked internally with Frankfurt airport. It is a long walk from arrivals with a lack of signage along part of the way. The hotel is clean, quiet and comfortable with an adequate restaurant with a good breakfast offering. The rooms are basic but with a comfortable bed, good shower and fast internet. The light switching was confusing. This is a good hotel for short stay or business purposes. The train station is between the airport and hotel, giving good travel options. The only irritation was having to go to the sister Hilton hotel nearby to print out Lufthansa boarding passes, with the IT system in the business centre incapable of doing such a simple task. </DOC> Could not fault anything in this conveniently located hotel. Seamless check in, clean room, nice restaurant and all we had to do was walk from our terminal (about 10 minutes ). It's our second time here and asked for late check out (2pm), which we got! It suits us! </DOC> We stayed at this hotel twice; once after an 11 + hour direct flight from Las Vegas, and once the evening before the flight home. It served as a restful oasis on one leg of the trip, and took a lot of the stress out of the return trip. Service was very good, location excellent. My only real complaint was our second night, before the return trip home, we ended up in a room that positively reeked with smoke. I informed the desk and was offered another room but we were simply to tired to bother. The onsite restaurant serves good food and has a very professional staff. The price, however, especially for breakfast, is beyond expensive. I suggest stocking up at the Kewe market at the opposite end of the railroad terminal, a very short walk from the hotel. </DOC> First time here, you could pick the real Hilton or the Garden which was cheaper. Check In fast, but they forgot to change my address and ask for my business address. Small very clean room, nice bath room but no separate shower. Window to the inside can\u00b4t open it, but air condition silent ! Check out crowded, but just leave the key and ask for sending the invoice possible (but with the wrong address, but they changed next day and send it again. Small restaurant and bar, but I hat my drinks at the real Hilton bar ! Very nice service there and nice bar food (tapas), and a great Martini.",

Rooms are modern and comfortable. Dinner was a bit basic but edible. I did not try the breakfast purely because of the rip off additional price. Staff were a mixed bag but overall this is a good hotel with a good price in a good location. </DOC> Convenient location with an easy walk to the airport makes this place a good investment- much nicer than the Sheraton at the airport, but still undewhelming. Rooms are OK, if a little cramped, wifi is painfully slow (actually unusable as I gave it up for the LAN connection). Room service is OK but horribly overpriced. </DOC> Stayed overnight for a morning flight departure. Room is very clean with complimentary coffee (instant) and tea. Room is comfortable, though small. Room has air conditioning as does the hallway. The bridge to the elevators is very warm in the summer. Restaurant is very nice and clean. Breakfast area is well kept. Staff is very pleasant. This is my preferred place to stay when flying out of FRA. </DOC> Excellent new hotel in the slightly oddly named Squaire area of the airport. You can walk there without going outside through the airport walkways. Not very well signposted but head for the long distance train station and then turn right when you get there. Lovely rooms, great staff, nice gym and sauna shared with the Hilton next door and is directly connected on the 11th floor. It does beg the question why would you pay more to stay at the Hilton which is basically the same hotel with the same rooms. My only complaint was that wifi was a little hit and miss and booted me out a few times. Not sure what the problem is. Breakfast was nice but I wouldn't pay the \u20ac25 for it the asked. Very easy to get into Frankfurt - probably about 15 minutes on the train. Really a very good choice for Frankfurt and the airport. </DOC> This hotel is great to catch a morning flight. My room offered a view of \u2018forest\u2019 and the city in the far distance. It is a standard room, with a large bed and a long counter/desk, with lots of sockets for charging. There are also a safe (sit on the floor of the cloth hanging cabinet \u2013 so it was hard to read/operate the thing), a water kettle, and a hair dryer. All were standard items in Hilton hotels. There are several restaurants and shops in the terminal... very convenient. </DOC> This hotel offers comfort and convenience but lacks any identity. Clearly meeting standards of the Hilton Garden Inn brand the hotel is satisfactory in cleanliness, location and amenities of the brand; however, one would never know you are in Frankfurt Germany. Whether this is by plan or by happenstance I am not sure. The problem though is that it is uninviting. I was treated fine on check in, but not greeted in the halls, the room smelled of the person who cleaned it before I walked in and the halls were rancid with the body odor of the cleaning staff. The room was small, but adequate and afforded a coffee pot and minimal bath amenities. The sound proofing was good and the door kept out hallway noise as well. I would make sure you only stay here before a flight. </DOC> The HGI is part of the Frankfurt International Airport. This made getting to the gate easy. The trains are super efficient and timely to get into town for shopping and meals. Make sure to get a day ticket at the booth before going downstairs to save time. The room was clean, classy and comfortable. The bed was standard firmness found in most Hilton properties. Staff were very helpful with my questions about navigating the airport and train station. The breakfast buffet was one of the better ones in all the HGI that I've stayed at. Next time I'm in Frankfurt, THIS hotel is where I'll be staying! </DOC> An extremely convenient hotel if you're flying in/out at either end of the day and don't want to find somewhere away from airport. Room was very well equipped, good bathroom and comfortable bed. Also very quite in the corridors so no disturbance during the night. The restaurant on site serves until late at night. Food is good but the prices are as you'd expect, a little high but it is very convenient. Great breakfast buffet, typically Hilton!",

Went back 30 minutes later and got room key...they had been cleaned out if fridge. I asked Housekeeping but they could not be traced...either chucked or taken. Shame. Otherwise nice stay with steam room, restaurant and bar all visited. </DOC> It is such a convenient place to stay if you have an early flight out or late flight in. The room was very comfortable and well-equipped and the food in the restaurant was good, too. Very helpful and friendly staff. The price including breakfast was quite reasonable (booking.com), particularly considering the stellar location. The business centre isn't very useful, I couldn't even use the extremely primitive computer/printer to print out a boarding pass. However, staff helped out and I was able to get my boarding card by emailing it to a member of staff who then printed it out for me. Still, at a Hilton I expect better facilities for business. </DOC> My wife and I were traveling from Croatia back home to the U.S. and had to overnight in Frankfurt. We decided to stay at the Hilton Garden Inn and were glad we did. We flew Croatia Airlines from Split to Frankfurt. After picking up our bags getting to the Hotel was super easy. We just crossed over a skywalk and after as short stroll we arrived. It's in a great locations with lots of shops and restaurants very nearby. We had an early flight the next morning on Lufthansa and were surprised to find a flight check in station right near the Hotel before we crossed back over the skywalk into the airport. Everything was so convenient and easy. If you have to stay at the Frankfurt Airport while traveling I highly suggest the Hilton Garden Inn. </DOC> We had to overnight at Frankfurt Airport and chose to stay here. It is a long walk from the Terminal but better than heading out to an off site hotel. Our room overlooked a forest, which was really nice. Breakfast was outstanding and the staff was corteous. The rooms are smallish but well appointed and the property is well kept. The bed is very comfortable and the television is of a nice size compared to the size of the room. Close to the hotel is a Lufthansa check in area linked to the train station. That saves some time and constrasts with the arrival experience. Signage could be improved as you need to go up and down and then down and up stairs and elevators to reach the hotel. Once you arrive you forget the trek. </DOC> Located next to Frankfurt airport, in walking distance from the terminal, good for layover if not desired to spend more for Hilton or Sheraton. Friendly check in. Small sized room with shampoo, soap but without other standard amenities (toothbrush, razor etc - possible to purchase at the reception) Soundproof windows impossible to open - the ventilation could have been better. Generally OK for one night. </DOC> This is a pretty good hotel. Comfortable rooms. Comfortable beds. A pretty generic bar. Not great front desk service unfortunately. The gym is quite nice. Worth a visit. But the location is amazing. Right at train station that's connected to the airport. So if you've got to fly out of Frankfurt in the morning, there's absolutely no where better to stay. There are limited options for dining later in the evening. Important to note - Frankfurt is a very frustrating airport. So even if you're in the best location, it can still take quite a while to get to your flight/gate. </DOC> Stayed here while at a tradeshow in town. Comfortable, attractive (contemporary d\u00e9cor), well located. Fairly expensive breakfast, but there are other options right out the door, inside the airport. Stayed for four nights in June 2015. Easy for taxi to reach from the city - for drop-off at the outside door nearest the hotel. </DOC> It is really nice hotel, located just 2 floor above the railway station, and just 300 meters from Lufthansa check in counter. The room is nice and clean with the newest flatscreen. Good internet connection. There are few restaurants and convenience stores in the mall that attached to the hotel. Good breakfast. Quick check in service. Nice fitness center though a bit complicated to get there as it is in Hilton property.",

Service is impressively attentive, and whole setting is very modern classic but still very classy. Room was quite spacious and perfectly professionally managed. Breakfast can get be better, but bar and vietnamese restaurant (Chinese food in reality) were excellent. Couldn't imagine one of the best quality Asian restaurant in San Sebastian. Very close to shopping and local restaurants, but very quiet most of time. I'd come back to stay here again. </DOC> Beautiful architecture, spacious and recently decorated rooms, friendly and very efficient service. This hotel manages to get everything just right. You feel welcome there, and don't want to leave this wonderful place. We booked a standard room, which very very nice, but we were unlucky to get a very noisy neighbor. When we informed hotel, we were immediately upgraded to junior suite free of charge, despite the fact that hotel was quite busy for New Year. Can't wait to return in the summer. </DOC> Very nice atmosphere, correct service but very slow. Their cocktails are very well prepared and you do get the feel of being in a classical elegant bar. Lots of American tourists which is great but why they where shorts and sneakers in a posh hotel in the evenings is hard to comprehend for us Europeans. Also strange that the hotel allows it in drink and dining areas. </DOC> It is a walk to the Constitution Plaza are and all its Tapa and Pinxto places. It is also the perfect location for a daily walk to the top of the Urgulleko Historiaren Etxea! The hotel is beautiful and the service matches it! </DOC> Everything about Hotel Maria Cristina exudes luxury and class - from the architecture to the service to the in-room toiletries. This hotel is not modern but it does not look dated. It is also within walking distance to restaurants and sights in San Sebastian. The concierge Rodrigo Uribe was friendly and helpful and made very good restaurant recommendations. Angel at the Front Desk was warm and welcoming. Eldon and David at Cafe Saigon were key to our having an enjoyable dinner at the hotel specialty restaurant. This hotel is very highly recommended. </DOC> Our visit to San Sebastian was great, but staying at the Maria Cristina made it memorable...the location was superb for sunset walks by the ocean and or along the promenade of the city.

Very European like hotel with ornate lobby and salons. Our room overlooked he river. Breakfast was lovely with wonderful Basque Country dishes.

Nice room ( though bathroom quite small), high level of service, great location. </DOC> We stayed 6 nights at the Maria Cristina, and loved our experience. Hotel is in a great location within walking distance of the old town and the beautiful beach. The concierge arranged for us to be picked up in Bilboa, stop for lunch in Geteria and brought to hotel. Great customer service for this and all of our other requests from restaurant recommendations to directions. Interior of the hotel is beautiful and one of the prettiest bars I have seen. We had a junior suite, lovely room. Weekends get very busy in the hotel as would be expected, maybe the only small negative in our stay. </DOC> The Maria Christina is just out of this world good. This was our second visit and it was every bit as good as we remembered - beautiful rooms, amazing service, little touches that make service just fantastic. I literally can\u2019t wait to go back next year. The one thing that would be a welcome addition is if the hotel added a spa as it\u2019s the only small thing missing from the facilities. It\u2019s a small complaint though given how good this hotel is. </DOC> A beautiful and nicely appointed hotel that is located opposite the river and and easy walk to the center of town and sites. This hotel is understated elegance and quite comfortable. Located nearby, especially if you like oysters, is a very good restaurant that is frequented by locals that also has a menu in English is KATA.4.

The property is very well maintained and it was a truly memorable experience from beginning to end - a very classy place. Highly recommend.",

Breakfast is okay but menu never changes and buffet looks tired and not appealing if arriving late morning.For a hotel with a cooking school lift the variety of your breakfast. Hotel has a local gourmet food shop which is excellent and a must to visit and the girl behind the counter who speaks great english is great for advice on the food especially the anchovies and where to eat locally. </DOC> Such a lovely, modernized, old world hotel...Everything was perfect, but this is what you expect from a 5 star hotel...didn't disappoint! The Dry Bar, lobby, staff and room were nothing but perfect. Only negative I could possibly point out is the shower stall is a tad small, especially for a big guy like my husband. </DOC> Our Tauck tour has us staying at the Maria Cristina for 2 nights. It couldn\u2019t be more centrally located. Everything worth seeing or doing is within walking distance. Our bedroom is huge with the largest king bed I\u2019ve ever seen.

Service was great. </DOC> Stayed here twice on the way and on the way back from Bilbao to Baqueira Beret. A fantastic hotel which has been recently renovated. Had one of the terrace suites not he top floor which have an amazing view of the town, river and the sea (the location of the hotel can not be beaten). Can not really fault the service in any way, all round excellent experience. Trust the concierge with some excellent restaurant and tapas recommendations (they have a great recommended tapas restaurant map so do remember to ask for one). </DOC> My husband and I had the great pleasure of staying at this hotel during our recent travels in Spain. We felt that it us without a doubt one of the nicest hotels we have stayed at anywhere in the world. It is truly a 5 star experience. We had a beautiful, spacious room with a water view. The decor in the room and public rooms is beaituful. We enjoyed a lovely breakfast everyday on a pretty patio of the hotel. The food served at breakfast was delicious with flawless service. The location of this hotel is perfect for touring magnificent San Sebastian. This is definitely the place to stay in this gorgeous city. </DOC> This was our second visit to this sumptuous establishment, and for good reason! The hotel is impeccable and the staff first rate. They directed us to the best of the best pintxos and a superlative spot on the beach. What more could one want in life? </DOC> This is my third visit to this hotel and each time it excels. Lovely rooms, great bar, real service makes this place really excel. The only thing that\u2019s very odd is there in house evening restaurant offers a rather odd \u2018Oriental\u2019 menu that just doesn\u2019t really get close to producing anything good. Its rather UK high street takeaway at best and it just doesn\u2019t have to be. Nothing wrong with being different however it should be good and authentic. That\u2019s a real shame and lets the hotel down badly in my opinion but with so many fabulous places to eat in the city it\u2019s really not a problem. However the breakfast is super. Especially the lovely smiley omelette lady! So brilliant hotel just don\u2019t eat their after midday. </DOC> The room was superb and the service was better. It was practically the only bar open late at night and I was thankful that we were staying. The valet parking works well even on a bank holiday! The hotel is so central that it is just a few minutes to the old town and all the life. Heartily recommend!",

Hotel is closing down in few days to completely renovate and open a new hotel few years later. I hope they will keep same beds :) </DOC> Great location. A 10 minute walk to the train station. We dropped off our luggage at the hotel and returned our rental car near the train station. The room is spacious but a bit dated. AC worked well which is important for summer time in Zurich. Didn't go to the shopping area as no stores were open on Sundays. However, there are plenty of shops and restaurants inside the train station. Breakfast and Wi-Fi were good. Small refrigerator in the room. Overall it's a very good hotel. Will stay here again next time we come to Zurich. </DOC> The hotel doesn't look particularly promising, neither is the location particularly exciting. The room was old style with thick carpets and lots of wood. However, everything seemed clean and reasonably new, including the bathroom. Service made this hotel for me - a warm welcome in Reception and in the Bar (more than once), a freebie box of chocolates waiting in my room when I returned at the end of the evening, efficient and friendly check-out. Overall one of the nicest hotel stays I've had for a while and I would definitely stay again. </DOC> A quiet relaxing stay in a large corner room on the fifth floor. Room spacious, bright, with a bit of a chalet/traditional theme,housekeeping excellent. Front of house friendly. Bathroom is good but shower hardware perhaps could do with an update? Very good location, an easy walk to the historical town, Station and main shopping areas. </DOC> We reserved an \"Urban Swiss Standard King\", but they must have upgraded us to something even better. The room was quite large and nicely furnished, with a big sitting area. The bed was very big and comfortable. The bath was sparkling and elegant, with huge, thick towels. In general, the hotel seemed quiet and efficient. Nicely located one tram stop from the central station. The breakfast buffet looked OK, but nothing special, at 32 SF per person. There are a few menu items which are a better value if you can get someone to wait on you (they encourage the buffet). </DOC> Recently stayed 4 nights at the MGallery in Zurich and while the room was a little small this was more than made up for by the great location (walking distance to the old town areas and train station) and excellent breakfast. Staff were very helpful. </DOC> A mid scale business hotel, located a ten minute walk from the main station. On checking in realised that I had stayed here earlier when it was the Sofitel. The current branding is more appropriate. The room was very comfortable and included a Nespresso machine. Staff were friendly and efficient. </DOC> 8 min walk from the train station, 15 min drive to the airport (taxi at about CHF 50). Room was clean, but a bit small and no place to open the luggage. Bathroom was particularly small compared to other MGallery Collection hotels. Quick and free wifi, but keeps logging you out at times. Good for a short stay only.",

        "docs": "We stayed here our last night in Switzerland. I did not like the area of town it was in and the rooms were well equipped. It was just an okay stay and would have liked it better if in a better area of the city. </DOC> Good hotel few minutes walk drom Zurich main railway station and 10 minutes walk to the old city of Zurich. good breakfast. Free WIFI. MGallery design. The fron desk staff is attentive and friendly and ready to assist in any subject </DOC> Just a short walk from the very complicated to manoeuvre through train station to the hotel. It was so very Swiss. The multi-cultural staff at the hotel was friendly, depending on who you spoke with. When asking questions about taking the \"S\" commuter trains, we found the staff dismissive and unhelpful. They were able to offer little to no information on ticket buying or location of where the train to where we were going was located. This is an old hotel that has been renovated and has a sterile feel about it. Our room had a sitting area and a desk in it that was unremarkable. The bathroom was good and the bed comfortable. We had a continental breakfast in an old world feeling room. The stay wasn't unpleasant, but we didn't leave saying we would return. Not a typical \"M\" Gallery stay. </DOC> We chose this hotel based on Tripadvisor reviews and we were not disappointed. Zurich, like much of Switzerland, is expensive and, in that context this hotel was good value. It is located one tram stop from the main railway station and, given that tram is the most practical way of getting around the city, the location is ideal. The bedroom was very nice. It was a large room with a separate lounge area, separate bath and shower room, and a separate toilet. The staff were very friendly and the breakfast buffet was excellent. We also ate in the hotel restaurant and bar one evening and enjoyed it very much. The staff were very friendly and helpful. </DOC> A bit disappointed on our 3rd stay here. Normally we stay in a room in the new section of the hotel but this time stayed in the older section. While the older rooms are bigger they are not in as good a condition. The pine furniture, presumably to look like a swiss chalet, looks old and worn. The brown carpet is also drab. Also the windows need cleaning inside and outside. The footpath at the front could also do with a sweep. </DOC> At walking distance of Zurich old city center, this hotel offer you the comfort of a Sofitel at a very reasonable price for Zurich, Hotel is cozy, nice rooms, very good breakfast, comfortable bar, staff is very friendly and helpful ... reception is very efficient. A good option for Zurich </DOC> Nice hotel within close walking distance to train and bus stations. A bit dated but still clean and breakfast was pretty good although they closed early one day putting a few people off to a bad start for the day with no breakfast. Staff were friendly and I would have no qualms staying there again. </DOC> The Hotel Continental in Zurich is central and walking distance to the main HB train station as well as the riverside restaurants and shops of the old town Zurich. The neighborhood is more commercial, but close to the quaint sections. The decor of the hotel is very \"urban Swiss lodge\". The public areas of the hotel including the bar are decorated with heavy furniture covered in dark and deep fabrics. I found the look to be mostly dated in style, but not overly worn. I went to the bar to have a drink, but I found it small and crowded, therefore, I did not end up staying. My room was large and decorated with wood paneling and dark red carpet. Again, dated in my opinion. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom well appointed as one would expect in this class of hotel. The hotel was just OK.",

        "docs": "Fantastic location central to shops and restaurants and the main Lisbon train station. Friendly courteous and helpful staff from the concierge to the maids. Old fashioned elegance, English pub style bar with comfy leather chairs and very reasonably priced drinks, a grand lounge with a piano player and concerts in the evening, quiet and well lit for reading and contemplating. Sumptuous breakfast buffet included in the room rate, tables set with linen, beautiful flower arrangements. We had a spacious suite on the 5th floor, very quiet despite the busy location, good black out drapes, gifts for the guests, fluffy towels, robes and slippers, chocolates on the pillow, complimentary water, free wifi. This well maintained and elegant hotel from a more graceful era really tries hard to please and for the price is a great choice for a short or long stay in the delightful city of Lisbon. </DOC> Even on 5th floor, the noise of people partying until 4 am down on the street would keep me from returning. Arrival at the hotel by car was not intuitive. GPS got us to the general location, but there was nowhere to park or any indication that the main entrance was on the side of the hotel. Rooms are dated. Decor looks like 1980 remodel. </DOC> Excellent central location and a beautiful old hotel. The common parts are particularly grand and comfortable. There is a lounge with free piano recitals on a regular basis and a nice bar next door. A fee gym is available for the energetic. The rooms are very comfortable and on this occasion we got a free upgrade to a large suite! Desk staff were friendly and great at hailing taxis. Recommended for a very comfortable stay in the very centre of Lisbon. </DOC> Nice hotel in center of city and walkable to many places. Rooms were good with nice balconies. Bathrooms were very small but functional. (tip..the good hairdryer is in the closet not the bathroom) Breakfast was just ok and beds were a bit too firm. Bar was nice but too bad it isn't used much. Would likely stay there again </DOC> This hotel has one of the best locations possible... it is diagonally located across the street from Rossio ... in walking distance to Rua Augusta, Praca do Comercio, Elevador de Santa Justa.... The lobby is beautiful, the rooms quiet and the staff beyond helpful. Breakfast has a magnificent spread of so many great choices... all fresh and inviting. </DOC> We struggled to choose a hotel in Lisbon. Every good review was matched with a bad one. However made a good choice with Avenido Palace. No complaints at all. Comfortable big room, NOT noisy, lovely public rooms,great breakfast and free parking. Position is perfect. On the flat but central. Highly recommended. </DOC> Don't be fooled by the modest exterior, which makes the opulence you discover inside even more breathtaking. This is one of the most beautiful hotels we've ever stayed in. The public rooms are fabulous. Everything is well-maintained and cared-for, and the staff are friendly and courteous. The breakfasts are wonderful, as are all the breakfasts we've ever had in Lisbon hotels. Lisbon seems to do breakfast particularly well! The location is perfect for getting around town, with nowhere too far. December is a great time to visit as the Christmas lights in the city are beautiful, and there's even a special Christmas tram journey which is run to raise funds for charity, and which is driven by Santa. Weather an unfailingly warm and sunny 22 degrees. What's not to like. Would definitely stay at the Avenida Palace again. </DOC> Hotel Avenida Palace was recommended to us by our trusted travel agent and we were not disappointed. Old world charm and elegance the property was beautiful. Fresh flowers antiques everywhere intimate clubby friendly staff- this place is exceptional. The location was great perfect for piddling around. We enjoyed breakfast in beautiful surroundings and a nice light meal and great drinks in the bar. Staff was so nice We felt at home- Highly recommended",

It is a beautiful maintain hotel, with music at night. The service staff is wonderful. It is like staying in a difference era, like the Victorian era. In World War II, this is where all the spys stay, including the famous Ian Fleming. Everything is well maintain. Walk down the staircase from the floors and you realized they don't built these hotels like these anymore. This much better than stay at newer five stars hotel, This hotel has personality. The only thing I have problem is their shower, no pressure. I would stay here again, when I visit Lisbon again. Highly recommended. . </DOC> The hotel was 1 block from a metro stop. From the hotel to most of the central tourist museums and stops in Lisbon was less than a 20 minute walk. The hotel has good triple rooms with real third beds (not just a thin mattress on a rollaway cot). There is a nice old world feel to the hotel including live piano music certain nights a week. Breakfast was a nice buffet breakfast with freshly made eggs, fresh fruit and more. </DOC> We loved everthing about this hotel. The public spaces are incredible, truly palatial, with live piano music at 7pm several evenings. Our large corner room was elegant and comfortable and a joy to return to after long days of walking. The breakfast buffet was delicious and the extended hours allowed us to \u201csleep in\u201d as we recovered from jet lag. The location is also good. Highly recommended! </DOC> If you're looking for the perfect centrally located home base for your visit to Lisbon, look no further. Close to Rossio Square and Metro, right next door to the Train Station, and about 4 blocks from the water - this can't be beat. Rooms were spotless, employees were professional and catered to your every needs. One gentleman even ran over and pushed the button on the elevator so I didn't have to ... Extremely helpful desk staff and concierge, plenty of storage for suitcases in room, replenished supply of bottled water in your room every day, free full breakfast, free wifi, comfortable beds - I mean the list goes on and on. Top notch hotel in a stunning city - you can't go wrong here - I can't wait to come back!! </DOC> The Hotel Avenida Palace was perfectly located to explore all that Lisbon has to offer. The breakfast is wonderful. The rooms were beautiful, clean, comfortable, and spacious. The staff was extremely friendly. The concierge actually walked a group of us to a restaurant one evening to make sure we found it and got a prime outdoor table. Very nice! </DOC> We have stayed 4 night in this wonderful hotel. I must admit that the reception didn't gave the impression that this hotel is going to one of my favourite from around the world. This is not just a hotel but you really can wonder around inside like a stately home. everything about it speaks quality and tradition. The breakfast room looks like one from royal palaces. The breakfast itself was truly fantastic. the room was fully equipped with very comfortable bed. I booked this hotel to celebrate my Wife's birthday- the hotel did everything to ensure that her Birthday will be so memorable. Thank you so much hotel Avenida for your wonderful hospitality. would I recommend this hotel? without a shadow of doubt. </DOC> Elegance and refinement, engaging staff and friendly, professional service define Hotel Avenida Palace. We can\u2019t imagine staying anywhere else. From the moment we booked through the moment we checked out we were made to feel comfortable and welcome. We asked for and were booked into the same room as last year, with a view of the main boulevard. Booking directly at the HAP website also entitles guests to complimentary evening cocktails and a generous full breakfast in the morning. The staff is fantastic. The porter at the front even remembered that we were taking the train and didn\u2019t have to ask before letting the taxi driver know where we were going. Now THAT\u2019S great service! We look forward to our next trip and will most definitely stay here again. Thanks to everyone who made our stay so wonderful! </DOC> Stayed here 3 nights while sightseeing in Lisbon. The hotel itself is elegant and the staff are welcoming and helpful.There is even a smartphone in your room to use during your stay. The rooms are comfortable, beautifully decorated and very clean. The hotel was very convenient for walking to sights and restaurants. Would highly recommend.",

When checking out the manager came out to see how I enjoyed the stay and if all went well which of course all did..it was a pleasure </DOC> My wife and I stayed at Hotel Avenida Palace recently while on vacation in Lisbon. I chose hotel primarily due to location and amenities. Location is close to Rossio train station, Barrio Alto neighborhood and Alfama neighborhood. Walking distance to multiple things to do and restaurants. The hotel is older but still very nice. I would call classic hotel. Amenities include free wi-fi, gym and breakfast. We stayed in junior type suite that had separate sitting area. We got 20% discount on food and beverages in bar due to booking on-line directly through hotel web site. Very friendly staff. Clean hotel and quiet. Really enjoyed our stay and the worst part was not long enough. </DOC> I stay in hotels a lot and therefore I was on the lookout for something special with atmosphere and I found it! The hotel is really like a palace, everything looks majestic and everything is well selected. The room was a bit small but still really nice. A nice touch were the strawberries on Valentines Day and the fresh grapes on the other days. Really nice. Breakfast is great, service is excellent and stays in the background which is really appreciated. Everyone super friendly so I was very happy. Some travellers noted they got upgraded or the hotel realized it was their birthday. It was mine but no one realized (no problem but would have been a nice touch and they could have known since they scanned my passport). Anyway, a great place to stay. </DOC> The Avenida Palace is beautifully located in downtown Lisbon, an easy walk from most points of tourist interest. Rooms are spacious, well-equipped, with large, soft towels, ample closet space and so on. Staff are lovely to work with, the breakfast buffet is excellent, and so on. The building is over 100 years old, with high ceilings, beautifully finished public spaces, comfortable lounges and more. I would not hesitate to recommend them to a visitor. </DOC> I booked this hotel based on its good ratings in Tripadvisor, it didnt disappoint! Room , while not large, was comfortable, and windows ( facing a busy thoroughfare) provided good insulation from noise. Included breakfast was fabulous. Loved the bar, very nice attendants, and prices are very reasonable. A couple of nights while we were there they had piano players in the main lounge/ lobby area. So nice!! </DOC> What a lovely hotel ! It is in a beautiful historical building, it couldn't be more central. Our junior suite was ideal for a family of three. The staff were attentive to every little detail. Fantastic breakfast ! </DOC> We so enjoyed our four nights in this lovely 19 Century building. Our room was very comfortable and quiet. The breakfast in the magnificent old dining room was excellent, offering a wide choice. The staff particularly the concierges were excellent. After a few nights in Evora, we returned to the hotel for one night. We thought we would treat ourselves by staying in a Junior Suite. We were very disappointed. It was a small room with a tiny tired bathroom and shower. A small sitting room was round the corner. It certainly wasn\u2019t worth 333 euros!! </DOC> I can't tell you how many \"favors\" the staff of this hotel did for us, from allowing us to store our luggage to helping us get around. They all went out of their way - honestly, we travel all the time and can can assure you this type of service is exceptional! If you like new \"edgy\" furnishings, this is not for you because it is (beautifully), totally traditional . . . something that is becoming harder to find. The breakfast selection is excellent too! Its no surprise at all that this hotel is so highly rated on TripAdvisor. The location makes it walking distance to many attractions and although its in a very busy area, the way the building is situated you are somewhat \"insulated\" from the noise. The main \"salon\" area looks exactly like the picture - breathtaking. I took the same picture! Highly, highly recommend!!",

The hotel has an old fashion decoration which not my preference but I had a good stay. Recommended for business or vacation as is very central. </DOC> Great location, and that saves the Lisbon Sofitel. Centrally located within walking distance of lots of must see locations. But an older Sofitel in need of a refresher and ridiciously small rooms. Not up to par with international quality chain level. </DOC> You can't beat the location of the Sofitel Lisboa...... easy to walk everywhere from here. Convenient to the airport, metro station across the street. Great Breakfast and helpful and efficient staff. The beds are very comfortable although the rooms are on the small side...... clearly a business vs tourist hotel. The gym is very limited and could do with some more equipment i.e. an eliptical machine...... definitely recommend this property! </DOC> We stayed here as part of a pre-cruise visit to Lisbon. The room is luxurious, with comfort and attention to the smallest details. When we returned to the hotel each evening, we discovered that our bed was made, and turned down. The bathroom is large, with quality amenities, including bath robes. Located on a busy boulevard in a shopping neighborhood, we heard no sounds from outside our room. Major historical sites are a short walk away, including the cable car and major squares. As can be expected, staff speak excellent English, and are very helpful. </DOC> The staff were all very helpful with info,of the area, restaurants and reservations. At breakfast the staff were cheerful and willing to help with menu choices. The decor is charming, rooms very comfortable, the bed exceptional. We had three nights here! All in all we really loved this hotel. It is also well located for seeing this part of the busy city. Walking to restaurants, shops, sightseeing, all easily found! </DOC> Have enjoyed a few Sofitel's but this one is very poor. Quite attractive on ground floor and very friendly staff but rooms are very small. First room was small with lots of heavy dark wood and was noisy. This from the (unused) a/c which had a sound of running water continiously. Changed this room the next morning to one facing the Avenida. This even worse due to appalling double glazing - window moved 5mm when you tried to press it closed once locked. Again a gloomy room. We had booked for 4 nights but needed a change after 2 sleepness nights. Decided to leave and moved to another Hotel about 100m away that we knew was quiet. This hotel needs a 100% refurbish but as it stands is a good 3* and a poor 4*. </DOC> Have stayed here many times before and it's my go-to place in Lisbon. Only stayed one night as a stop-over on my way back to Brazil. Was given room 201 (upgrade, thanks!) which is one of the recently refurbished rooms. Nice that there is now a walk-in shower, but the bathroom was small overall and the decoration / new flooring not really to my taste, at least. However, this hotel is really good for comfort, location (a few minutes walk from Praca Rossio, ten minutes to the airport, tram to Bairro Alto very close by) and service (Luciano at the door remembered me from two years before, this makes you feel welcome). Check-in from Carlota was lovely, breakfast very good, room sound-proofing very good too. Recommended. </DOC> With the Sofitel brand, in general, i am never disappointed. In Lisbon, the hotel is nicely located, walking distance from the old town. Nice atmosphere, comfortable room - quiet - and despite the size, it gives a kind of \"family atmosphere\". On the negative point, i must admit my room was below expectation. I would have expected at least a decent desk and chair to work, and a slightly bigger room (esp. as a member of Accor Club). Very good breakfast but the service for me was bad : i had to ask 3 times for the coffee ... which i got finally at the end of my breakfast. A lot of people but low efficiency.",

I found the hotel \u201cdark\u201d as not many daylight can come in, our meeting room had no windows whatsoever and lunch was served on a couple of occassions in an area also completely excluded from daylight. Bar area is rather dark as well, albeit nice service. Location obviously is very good but would probably select a different hotel next time (which I did for the weekend actually - see review of Sheraton Lisbon). </DOC> I was quite disappointed with this hotel. I was expecting so much more. The rooms are quite small and tired. I have stayed in better hotels in Lisbon. The breakfast however was very good and the service was excellent. The people at the reception were friendly. Location is very good. I think the hotel needs a lot of work to be able to compete with the other hotels and with Airbnb. To me, it was not value for money. I will not stay here again. </DOC> Stayed during a business trip. Check in was good and the staff were very friendly and professional. Unfortunately, the rooms themselves are outdated with furniture that has seen better days. However, what I found unacceptable was the sloppy cleaning. The bathroom had hairs in three places and the shower was dirty... I complained and was offered another room on a different floor which - surprise, surprise - was equally poorly cleaned. So this reflects clearly inadequate housekeeping. No Head of Housekeeping should allow such standards or else needs better training! </DOC> The Sofitel Lisbon Hotel is located in a prime position in the heart of the centre along beautiful Avenue de Liberdade. It\u2019s a five minutes walk to most attractions including having shops, cafes & restaurants at your fingertips. Our suite was large with a separate living room with a working desk, mini bar & TV. The suite also had two lovely tiled bathrooms which made our stay more pleasurable. We used the bar frequently for pre dinner drinks. The restaurant we only used once for lunch & found it to be very good. Breakfast was excellent although we did have to wait at least 15 minutes for a table one morning which was annoying. Overall - beautifully positioned in a stunning city. The staff were always friendly & knowledgeable. A credit to this establishment. We throughly enjoyed our short stay & would recommend the Sofitel for its location, staff & comfortable warm ambience. </DOC> We just spent 12 nights in the Sofitel. As always our experience was excellent. This hotel appears to have a very low staff turnover thus there is always a welcome from somebody you know. The service continues to be very good and we were upgraded to a large room on the 8th floor. The breakfast continues to be superlative and the servers are very helpful and efficient. The bar service also continues to be very good. I would like to thank everyone on the front desk including concierge and bell hops. </DOC> We stayed here for 3 nights in January and really loved this hotel!! The location is central and walking distance to most places in Lisbon which was great. The room was large, modern and clean with excellent WiFi. Breakfast provided was fantastic - so many choices and really helpful staff. We also enjoyed a drink at the bar and the staff were so friendly and accommodating. The concierge was great - they were more than happy to assist with any queries we had including bookings and recommendations. Such great service provided! Overall this is a fantastic hotel - its really is a 5 star hotel with great rooms, staff and facilities. We can't wait to return and highly recommend it. </DOC> I stayed 3 nights and would highly recommend the Sofitel. We were greeted with a warm welcome and our room was to a good standard. Breakfast was also fine . The hotel has the best location for tourists as you can easily walk to the main tourist areas. I really liked the Sofitel </DOC> Stayed one night in Lisbon before flying back to US Rooms were spacious elegant and plush Accommodations very nice staff friendly and service great The food in the restaurant was excellent served hot and tasty Would recommend",

That I had to get housekeeping to tape over was strange but that this is the first time I have ever seen this. Which is a pity as although a talking point it does detract from a good experience elsewere.

Good rooms with reasonable space. Very good WiFi and professional staff. An average breakfast but loads of choice. I would certainly return as it is very good for the business traveler </DOC> The rooms were ok at best. The bar tender was a jerk and very rude. Location was great. However, I wouldn't stay here again and made a mistake staying here this time. I should have stayed at the local Bestwestern. For the money, it is a better option. </DOC> Another business trip to Brussels, and another stay at this Hilton near Rogier. And I'm afraid this was not a case of absence making the heart fonder. The rooms are small and poky, the hotel itself is starting to get a bit shabby now, and the queues for check in (and out) were definitely not best in class. But - worst of all - I had a terrible night's sleep as the room was definitely not sound proofed. One to avoid in future </DOC> I stay here all the time when I am in Brussels. Mainly, it's in a perfect location. A few blocks from Brussels North train station. Rates are typically tremendous value for money. Wonderful breakfast with eggs benedict! Always to return! Can't say enough good things! </DOC> Just had an over night stay in the Hilton and the 1st impression was very good from the moment I was greeted by the reception staff - very helpful The room was ok clean and compacted although a bit on the dark side The problem I had is the cleaning staff - they have a store room opposite my room 401 and at 7.30am she decides to get her trolley and cleaning kit to put in the main corridor on doing so smashing into my door and others along the corridor Why - when they then leave them in the main corridor until the guest check out which I think is between 11/12 </DOC> Stayed there as I had meetings.the location is extremely good central and close to the train station which is ideal from the airport. It is also close to main streets with shopping and restaurants all around. The staff in the hotel was very nice and welcoming, the room very small however. Clean but small. The issue is that every time someone left their room the door would bang. When I checked it is simply because the door stopper was fitted on the bathroom door and not on the main door. Absolutely crazy. Management should review that as I don\u2019t think it\u2019s safe. </DOC> Stayed many times here, always a good experience. The revamped lobby areas are very nice, great for Instagram. The hotel is located a bit away from the station and city centre, about 10 minute walk. Note that this is mostly for business people. The water pressure in the shower is great! The breakfast was goo also.",

It's also located at Place Rogier, which is more or less the start of the shopping street Rue de Neuve which will lead you into the old town centre with all the famous tourist sights and restaurants in about 15 minutes. We enjoyed the breakfast at the hotel and our room was very spacious and the bathroom was also very nice. </DOC> Service could be ok. They let me check in early so that I could explore the city a bit. That said- There was no help with luggage to my room. The elevators are very small and slow. The room I was given was dirty. The area is great to getting to some cool areas. But... After the stores close the whole area becomes a homeless shelter in boxes. It\u2019s really sad :( </DOC> I was in Brussels for 3 nights. I'm Hilton Honors & stayed on a combination of points/money. I was given a large room that faced the front of the hotel. Unfortunately, there was construction & sometimes noisey from the police sirens. The room was clean, large, furnished modern with a bit of luxury. The bathroom was large with a large bathtub. The breakfast was good even though it was the same very day. Location was convenient - close to the train station & walking distance to shopping, restaurants & beautiful sights. </DOC> I stayed here to be close to Covent Garden-right next door and Brussels Nord- 5 minutes walk. The hotel's entrance and lobby is fine, the reception staff is friendly and efficient. However, the rooms are in pretty bad shape- they are now in need of refurnishing- but the price of the room reflects that. Breakfast was very crowded and hurried a bit- but it had all kinds of variety and a very good value. Wifi worked well- the room was clean, and the check in and out was efficient. It is not a luxury hotel but a functional business hotel. </DOC> Stayed fat the Hilton Brussels City for the first time - booked through one of the travel sites and got an excellent rate with breakfast. Room was very nice, small, no view, but, for the price, no complaints. Good, clean, air conditioned, nice bed. Most staff were friendly. Bar staff could be a lot friendlier. Excellent location - Metro and trans just a few hundred metres away. </DOC> A very comfortable hotel to visit some of the nicest shopping areas in Bruxelles Checkin and check out without any problem. Nice, competent and polite staff. The hotel is definitely not the newest around, and in my case the bathroom could use a refreshing, but for the rest is quite a good hotel Internet worked pretty well </DOC> This is a 4 star hilton. As such it serves its mission. I stayed there for one night. I was greeted by a very polite greek guy, smooth check-in and an upgrade as well. I stayed in room 907, which was really nice. The only downside is the mechanisms of the door, unless you hold them they will bang. This was the only minor issue.",

It is a lovely hotel, great staff, and lovely rooms. Their customer service was excellent at check in and also when we dined in the bar for dinner. The room was extremely clean and it was nice to have a full size bathtub/shower after having some really small ones in other European hotels. The free wireless was also a bonus - and it actually had great connectivity! I would definitely recommend this hotel to other travelers. </DOC> There we were in the middle of winter flinging the windows open because we couldn't get the room to cool down. Our experience in the restaurant was dismal - we were ignored, no menu nothing because we didn't want the buffet. Eventually got served but then no bill. Stayed for 2 night - after 24 hours our cards were cancelled. The desk clerk blamed it on our mobile phones - how strange - our phones had remained in our room all day. What rubbish. Woken at 5am by someone clomping above presumably on an early flight. Overall not a pleasant experience </DOC> The hotel located across the Vienna airport terminal reflects the NH standards and goes beyond the expectations of normal airport hotels. Good services and good crisis management skills by the staff. Room and bed match higher standard. </DOC> As it is Airport hotel and everybody are coming just for one night here, nobody is expecting extreme comfort and it is true. TV did not work in our room, but as we came rather late we did not make any noise. Lady registering breakfast eaters did not recognize that breakfast is included in our room rate. I had to go to reception and they had to call for that lady to let us have breakfast... Rooms are very standard 9we booked superior room), but what to do -we could survive there one night </DOC> Located in close neighbourhood of airport terminal in Vienna/Schwechat. Room was missing refreshing touch but clean. Breakfast \ud83e\udd5e from 0530, What is great \ud83d\udc4d to catch up first flight. Breakfast has got great choice even fried rice \ud83c\udf5b for being happy \ud83d\ude03 as more demanding to avoid bread \ud83c\udf5e breakfast. Super paid parking choices around in walking distance </DOC> Literally, this hotel is across a street from the Vienna airport - a street you can cross on your own without a shuttle bus. We've stayed twice and been very pleased with the accomodations. The staff was friendly, though there are lines, and the room clean and comfortable. We had a drink and light meal in the hotel bar -- to avoid the more expensive buffet -- followed by a good night's sleep before our early morning flight. I highly recommend this hotel if you have a morning flight as we did. </DOC> We stayed for one night following a late evening flight arrival into Vienna. The location is excellent, being a short walk from arrivals and just across from the station and hire car desks. The hotel is very modern, clean and comfortable. We were greeted with a free drink voucher and also ate a snack in the bar - tasty and friendly, efficient service. Breakfast was included and was extremely good. A huge, varied selection. All in all, an excellent stop over. </DOC> Overall poor experience on many levels. Checkin and checkout inefficient and not customer friendly. Bar service disengaged, bar ambiance and layout not appealing. Room design made me laugh. Smallest shower in the Western Hemisphere. Comfortable bed. Room was only 100$ so what I got was just what I paid for in this location ... Never again.",

You can pay for them room at check-in and if you don't use the minibar the check-out will be lightning fast - basically you just leave the room key at the reception and leave. The rooms are quite. Wifi is not very fast, AC doesn't work, only heating available </DOC> one of the best airport hotel experience. Room was very clean, all the amenities perfect. the airport is on the other side of the road. The check in/out is very quick. I will use this hotel whenever on Vienna airport. </DOC> We took a train into Vienna and flew out to US the next morning. This location was perfect. Short walk (well marked) from train and short walk to planes. The sixth floor room was very nice, bed was comfortable and well sound-proofed. We heard no noise from airplanes or traffic (only some noise in the hallways). Nice to be able to make coffee in room. Room was a little too warm for us. Seemed to be few choices for dinner nearby so had dinner at this hotel. Ordered a la carte rather than the buffet. Food OK but drinks a little overpriced. Nothing inside airport seemed to be very convenient but maybe we didn't explore enough. </DOC> Very conveniently located just adjacent to the arrivals area of Vienna Airport. The hotel staff are friendly and check in was smooth, although they couldn't accommodate my early check in. The rooms are well appointed and comfortable with good soundproofing. The fitness centre was a bit disappointing because at least two machines did not work. Otherwise, the wellness centre was fine. The restaurants were a bit disappointing. The usual overpriced hotel food with average quality food. Unfortunately, there are few other options so you are stuck there. </DOC> Within walking distance of the CAT train to the city and the airport this hotel was ideal for an early flight. The room was excellent, bed comfortable and equipment to a high standard. I was able to book in early which allowed me to work. No disturbance from flights at any time. </DOC> I had a brief stay here in order to be close to the airport. This was the perfect answer. It is right across from the train station and airport for easy access into town and flights. The rooms are average, but comfortable. They offer early bird breakfast for those with an early flight. I will definitely stay here again when flying through Vienna. </DOC> I had an unexpected overnight in Vienna. Upon arrival, I was guided to this airport to try to book my overnight. Front desk was helpful and friendly. Check in was easy and efficient. Rooms are comfortable. Shower and bathroom are good. Bed was really comfortable and I had a solid sleep. Bar and restaurant were open later and I was pleased to be able to order a meal/drink upon arrival. At the bar, food was ok and service was good. It was a comfortable environment. The walk to/from the airport was easy and convenient. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place or stay here again. </DOC> This hotel has two sections. I was in the older section that was very clean but not very updated. The air conditioning did not work however you can't beat the hotel if you have an early flight as the airport terminal is adjacent.",

We had the superior room which cost more for more squer meters. The room is nice but noisy if you open the window. (aircondition did not work !) </DOC> Spent one night here on the way out of Vienna. Nice hotel, very well run, a bit \"sterile\" as it has a very high volume of customers. Rates were fair, food was ok, rooms were nice. Excellent for a short stay. Easy access to train to city center and you walk to the airport from the lobby. </DOC> Pretty standard, modern, commercial hotel. Neither the best nor the worst NH I've stayed in. Shows a little wear in places, but nothing major, and for convenience to the airport with access to the city, can't be beat. Walk across the street to the train station to access the city by train and to access the airport terminal by underground walkway. Our only complaint was a week to sometimes non-existent Wi-Fi signal in room 5502. Otherwise, quite satisfactory. </DOC> Very convenient located inside the airport. It is a busy hotel but they are very efficient and the room was nice, very clean, with good beds. We had a good rest before our long oversea trip. It is just across the street from airport. I would not use it to visit Vienna but it is great to rest one night, specially if you have an early flight or you arrive very late and tired. </DOC> Excellent location 200 meters from the airport across the parking lot. Perfect for early departure. Next to train station- easy connection to downtown Vienna. Good clean rooms, not very large but comfortable. I have only spent one night - cannot complain. </DOC> My wife and I were forced to spend the night near the airport, due to flight cancellation. We booked a night at the NH, primarily due to its convenience. Yes, it\u2019s overpriced, but most airport hotels are. The gentleman who checked us in was very understanding and friendly, helping us with needed amenities. The room was very comfortable, although the a/c wasn\u2019t up to snuff. We were able to open the window, however. One annoyance was the lack of a shelf in the walk-in shower. Otherwise, a good hotel with a great staff. </DOC> The best thing about this hotel is the convenience to the airport. Stayed here for an early morning flight and it was very convenient. The rooms were quiet and the wifi was adequate. No problems with check in or check-out. Staff was friendly. Rooms seemed a little bit tired, but not in a worrisome way. </DOC> We had a stopover here while traveling. The location is excellent for the airport and also next door to the train station which has the train to the City Centre which only takes 16 mins. The rooms are larger than most airport hotels and had a king size bed, there is tea and coffee available and all mod cons. The bathroom is quite small but has all necessary facilities, the shower area is a little snug but all in all very comfortable. We had to pay \u20ac50 extra for breakfast (for 2 x persons) there is a very good choice but I think is still very overpriced, which may explain why the restaurant was empty! On the whole we enjoyed our stay more for convenience rather than value for money.",

The bar area is spacious and pleasant. The executive room was well appointed and very clean and comfortable. Good sized double bed. There is ample parking and a shuttle service to the airport. This takes 25 minutes to get to the airport so allow plenty of time. </DOC> One night stay preparing for morning flight. Check in was efficient with helpful staff member and follow up check to ensure room was acceptable. Evening meal in bar area was relaxing and food served quickly and efficiently. Room on 6th floor was standard executive level but clean and adequate with very little outside noise. </DOC> I did not expect much from a holiday inn, but this place is great. Staff are outstanding, from the group at breakfast to the check in to the restaurants ... the gym is pretty good too. It is an easy bus ride to Heathrow and then you can take the express into London. The rooms are quite spacious as wel. </DOC> Large airport hotel not near much, with lots of airline staff and tourists staying. \u00a34.50pp hotel hopper from the airport, but goes around several hotels on the way and takes about 25 minutes to terminal 3. Friendly efficient check in, and a free drink or points for Spire members. Rooms clean and comfortable with comfortable bed, good linens and a power shower. Aircon and WiFi both good, and a safe in the room. Bar food is ok but expensive and the same goes for the bar drinks. If parking, avoid parking under trees as you will have a pile of surprises on your windscreen when you return. Overall ok for a business stay. </DOC> I stayed here about 10 years ago and it was OK! Due to an early morning flight I booked the night prior and ended up here, my room was on the ninth floor and had been recently refurbished and looks really good as well as the public areas in the hotel. My only critique was room service. I ordered a chicken Kiev which came nicely presented but they then sprinkled chopped raw garlic on top of the chicken, why!! It made the taste of the chicken unpleasant, however the accompanying sides where tasty. Despite the room service and it\u2019s cost (\u00a326 incl a small white wine) I would be happy to stay again in the future. </DOC> Our base for one night. A good location with very well trained and professional staff. Rooms were clean and bright. Deal included dinner and breakfast. No problems there. All in all, a very good experience. </DOC> Stayed for 1 night before early flight - Reception was excellent and staff very attentive and the signing in completed very efficiently - Room very clean and tea/coffee facility. Food nice but quite expensive but this is normal in London area. Overall very satisfied </DOC> Staff friendly and helpful, room comfortable, good value for night stay and 15 day parking. Food was reasonable for a meal deal but they had run out of steak for my wife. I had chicken curry and accompaniments which was good. The Buffet for the kids was a bit basic with not much choice and hot items cold. Didn't bother with breakfast this time. Shuttle to airport is first on route so took time to get to the airport but first drop off on way home when it finally turned up (2 at once). Unfortunately someone thought it was funny to tip a can of Fanta over our car while we were away.",

The room was comfortable but noise from an adjoining room led to a disturbed nights sleep. </DOC> We spent two nights here whilst visiting Hampton Court RHS show at Hampton Court and Windsor. This hotel appears to cater mainly for coach parties,air line staff and passengers from over booked flights' The number of people trying to use dining facilities for breakfast and dinner was such that queueing for meals would appear to be the norm. The bedrooms were ok ,well insulated and clean ,major problem was trying to have a shower on the tenth floor little water pressure. </DOC> We arrived very late at night, so made little use of the bar area. Apart from a Christmas tree we were taken aback by the complete absence of the 'old' and easy on the eye lobby, bar and lounge furnishings.That whole area looks as if it is still Work in Process and the new location of the bar, and the seating arrangements looks unfriendly and cheap.As ever the beds were comfortable, the bedroom was fine and the breakfast was good.However, in the past I complained about the absence of Lea & Perrins (Worcester Sauce) at breakfast and this was corrected. However, this time around none could be located, which is absurd.In view of the new furnishings, we will be trying another hotel for our return trip to Cyprus in January. </DOC> We've stayed here a few times before before travelling out of Heathrow. I've given 4 stars in the past but it seems to be slipping a bit. Yes it is conveniently located and has everything you'd expect. But the room seemed a bit tired (especially the bathroom). The pub wasn't open which is a shame. The bar area is OK though. The food was pretty disappointing - soggy chips, boring pizza. \u00a316 to park overnight is a bit steep! </DOC> I had to spend one night here in transit from Cyprus to Dallas on a 10 hour layover. This hotel is very comfortable, do not get me wrong, and has a lot to offer. I was particularly disappointed this time around because coming off a 5 hour flight with a 10 and 4 hour flights ahead of me, I was hoping to be refreshed. Instead, after a good sleep, I woke up to find that there was no hot water in the showers...anywhere! So, needless to say, I had a field bath of cold water and was not a happy camper for the duration of my travel, thanks to this hotel! The other issue was the concierge, or reception. They were not that concerned about the discomfort and inconvenience this had on its guests, only stating that they were \"working\" on the issue! </DOC> Convenient to Heathrow (Hotel Hoppa, or about 12 pounds for a taxi). Recently renovated - nice facilities. Pub (The Plough) within walking distance. My new favorite hotel near Heathrow, particularly if you can get it at a competitive price. </DOC> I stayed there during my overnight transit in LHR after flight from KEF. Staffs were polite and friendly. Late check-out was given until 2 pm. I also enjoyed the breakfast, it's a mixed of continental and traditional English breakfast. There was no complimentary shuttle, as any other hotels in LHR area use the Hotelhoppa services (5 GBP per way) Given its moderate price - I paid around 45 GBP including the breakfast (IHG Winter sale), I was quite satisfied with the stay. I can't comment too much on this hotel's facilities though, since I was staying there for overnight transit only. </DOC> Pretty simple. If you're flying out of Heathrow then this hotel is ideally located. 5 minute drive and you're at the airport terminal/car parks. Rooms are spacious and clean although the front desk service a little abrupt. Handy for airport and would stay again.",

Room was clean and clearly quite new, except for the damage that was visible on the ceiling directly over the bed.

(Plus some very noisey machinary on the roof above the room that buzzed incessantly.) Contacting the Front desk was also a challenge, taking several attempts, and being promised a call back that never occurred. Disappointing stay compared to previous visits. </DOC> Staff were great especially at reception, very efficient, we had a one night stay pre holiday, pick up bus came on time, car was kept safe, all good!! Room comfy,quiet, well equipped, bar lively, good sleep! </DOC> Stayed overnight while on an omega trip to London. On arriving our keys were handed to us on the coach so we could go straight to our room. The rooms are comfortable, clean and quiet. We had a meal included which I had to say far exceeded my expectations. All our table were very impressed. An excellent nights sleep. Can recommend. </DOC> Summary: A very good airport hotel. Like most Holiday Inns, it was clean, comfortable, and an excellent value. They allowed us to occupy one room with our two kids which was a bit tight but not much of an issue. The hotel staff was friendly and well trained. Our room rate included wifi and breakfast so the value was excellent. I had stayed at this hotel many years ago when it was still a different brand. The location is excellent and the hotel provides a shuttle to the airport or free parking should you have a car with you. Highly recpmmend this hotel to the frequent traveler. </DOC> I stayed here one night after a flight cancellation. Room is large and housekeeping did a good job. Service was friendly but not too fast. Hotel restaurants are very lacking in taste and quality of food. </DOC> Stayed here in August with family night before an early flight and was great. Hotel was busy with airline staff but wasn\u2019t an issue. Parking included in bundle and was all fine. Only thing I never understand if you have 4 people in a room why not provide same amount of towels? Didn\u2019t use restaurant as a nice country pub next door. Hopper connection easy enough. Would return if price stayed competitive. </DOC> I had the opportunity to visit this excellent hotel with good rooms and excellent staff. The hotel is conveniently connected to the airport and the city with good bus connections. The restaurant and room service options offer good variety. The health club is well equipped. A convenient hotel for travellers. </DOC> Stayed in room 327. It was small, clean with a very small bathroom. The water was very slow to empty on the sink and bath. Bath water only warm. The carpet was a bit strained and there had been a water leak in the room itself. Bed ok, hairdryer barely worked. Toilet paper only 1 ply. We paid \u00a370 for the room and \u00a310 for breakfast. Overnight parking was \u00a316. Breakfast was adequate, bacon was floating in fat but not too bad. Coffee was from a machine and was very strong. Spoons next to the machine dirty and sticky.

The hotel is beautiful and very mordern yet has Middle eastern touch . Excellent service and rooms are fabulous . Breakfast was great . Excellent views of the mountains .Location is in a quiet area . My favourite place to stay in Muscat . </DOC> About 30 minutes drive from the airport, this very nice and modern Sheraton. Lots of free parking at ground, and also easy to find should hire a car. Huge lobby, two pools, indoor and outdoor. Outdoor pool completely shaded, as are the sunchairs most of the time. Rooms large, all amenities, quiet and free bottles of water, coffee and tea,p. Large fitness area too. We had a room with shower in the bath, something I dont like. Extensive but in my view very expensive breakfast, at \u20ac 32 pp.... What should improve: service and cleaniness around pool. Not sure who should clean up bottles and ashtrays of people who leave, but it was only done end of day. Also, sat 2 hours before I saw a waiter. Later I heard the poolstaff would take care of getting a waiter, unusual. </DOC> Stayed with the family for 2 days in two connecting rooms. Wonderful well renovated hotel with lovely touches, a nice pool area, modern gym and great food selection for breakfast... would return any day when on business in Muscat. Close to Royal Opera House Close to main government district </DOC> Staying here with kids is good because of the swimming pool which is shaded with different shallow areas. Unfortunately kids are not allowed to the executive lounge during happy hour but otherwise it is good. Staffs are friendly and helpful with kids especially those in swimming pool. Breakfast is great with fresh juice station with many choices from celery and watermelon till orange and carrot. Dined at poolside Courtyard restaurant was a good option with mixed food. Executive lounge also is good with different hours: morning snack, afternoon tea, happy hour and... Location is not the ideal, almost no restaurants around the hotel. 10 minutes from Mutrah Souq and half an hour from airport and City Centre Mall. Far from beach and city. </DOC> The tallest building in Muscat and a good decent standard Sheraton hotel. Lovely pool area and fantastic indoor pool and gym. Also a nice spa with Indonesian or Thai female therapists. A female therapist in this part of the world is a real plus point. Hotel rooms are nice and as usual with Marriott or SPG hotels they remember your prime reason to be there and provide a comfy bed. Well done Sheraton. Breakfast is your standard Buffett affair but the food in the evenings in the restaurants is very good, but beware the prices ! It is very expensive to eat in the hotel and there are no local restaurants around. So it\u2019s a taxi or you are a captive audience. All in all. Good hotel and a good place to stay, but food while excellent is too expensive. </DOC> What is great about this hotel? The luxury, the staff, the club lounge, the amazingly brilliant pools and gym, the fabulous breakfast, the friendly concierge or the laid back and calm nature of it all. Parking is free and abundant, you\u2019ll be needing a car as it is in the business area of Ruwi but that aside Ruwi has good restaurants and the beach areas struggle to match. Worth upgrading to club for the lounge and breakfast and the rooms are superb. Nothing at all to fault. </DOC> My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights while we were in Muscat. As a platinum member, we were upgraded to a nice, large suite, which was modern and comfortable. We went to the beach both days, which was nice that we were close to a lot of the main beach resorts. Taxis were really easy to get from the hotel and were also close to the souq and waterfront area. I would stay here again while in Muscat, but definitely geared more towards business travelers.",

Service, restaurants are all very good standard (breakfast and the steakhouse tried this time) </DOC> Had two stays here and very impressed. First room was a Club and was large, modern and well appointed. On the return was upgraded to a Studio Suite which was large and had great amenities. Club lounge is generous with a good evening spread and wine, beer, spirits etc. Breakfast in the main restaurant was good with the usual offerings. Staff are extremely welcoming and I would certainly return again. if you have time whilst visiting Muscat to go to Wadi Shab I highly recommend it. You need to be fit and carry LOTS of water but a great experience. </DOC> Stayed here for two nights and left with an average impression. The hotel lost marks because the in house restaurants are weak, questionable food and in-attentive staff. The upstairs club lounge is poorly laid out and gets a little to full. The room was clean, quiet and spacious, with a nice view of city and mountains. Hotel is located 60 mins walk to old muscat and harbor, 10 mins drive to parliament building, 5 minute walk to little India shopping area, 25 mins drive to airport. I would consider staying here again, but depends which side of Muscat I would want to be on. </DOC> A lovely hotel with friendly staff and good food, especially the buffet breakfasts. Handy location close to the SOUQ and there are lots of restaurants in the area too. The pool area is nice and options for lunch by the pool a good too. Good wifi too. </DOC> My expectations of the Sheraton Oman were not very high but how wrong I was! From the moment I stepped through the door at 8am and they had my upgraded room ready for me, I was not disappointed. The Club Level room (I\u2019m a Platinum Elite member) was fresh and roomy with a great view across the city. The Club Lounge was excellent with a good selection of happy hour offerings. The staff were very attentive and always kept your glass full. The outdoor pool is very pleasant and also had a very attentive team looking after you. The only slight criticism I would have of the hotel is that they should stock gin in the Club Lounge! </DOC> The rooms were great - large and very comfortable. The bathroom excellent. The hotel has great buffet breakfast with a wide variety of options. There is an outside pool area including sunbeds and general seating areas. There is also an indoor pool, gyms etc. No faults with this hotel at all. The hotel sits within the Ruwi area of Muscat. There is not a lot to see or do in the area specifically though it is about half a mile to the main bus station which gives you the option to explore a lot further afield including the Grand Mosque, Mutrah Souq, Opera House etc etc all for 60p a time. </DOC> Not in the most glam location, but if you\u2019re after a decent hotel with good service, nice rooms and lots of options, this is the one. Really good selection of licensed F&B options including pool bar and bbq. Extensive breakfast. Feels like recently refurbed so all very smart. Warm service. We left an iPad there and they sent it on to us within the week without bother. </DOC> Stayed for 2 nights on business visit. We had a conference in the hotel. The Wifi service was terrible so poor that most attachments in emails wouldn't open. Forget about browsing YouTube or Twitter. Rest of the hotel stay is about what you expect from a hotel this level. Nothing that wowed you. They need to improve their wifi for business travelers",

        "docs": "This is my second time visiting Muscat. We chose this hotel due to its location - the mosque and opera are easily accessible if you drive West and the souq and palace are very close if you drive North. The rooms are nice and the beds comfortable. Our twin room came with two queens in it so plenty of space! The price was very reasonable (although we didn't include breakfast as this would have increased the cost a lot). We did spend a day on the beach but just paid for beach entry at one of the other hotels. Would definitely stay there again is visiting Muscat. </DOC> The hotel is great. From the beginning to the end everything was perfect. All the people are willing to help and always smiling, saying hello and and try to keep like you feel at home. Rooms are big enough and very clean. Breakfast is very good with great food (any kind of). Lounge was also great and almost always available. I asked Concierge for a tour and they help me for everything. And was very good tour. Hope to be back. Strongly suggested. </DOC> This hotel is newly renovated/reopened and it almost felt like I was in a boutique hotel. The pool (inside out outside) was great as well as the spa and gym area. For me what really stood out was the amazingly personal service by Sameh Fathy and his team. Everyone at this hotel deserves a pat on the back for making me feel so welcome. Thank you! Highly recommended. </DOC> First time staying at this property. Incredible service staff welcoming me - special thanks to Dimas and Denn Mark. Room was very comfortable and practical. I particularly like the USB changing dock at the work desk. Location is perfect if you are having meetings in the CBD/Ruwi area. The Argentinian steak house - Asados - was TOP class. I had one of the best beef cheeks in the region that evening. Quite flawless a stay and made me want to reconsider giving up my spire IHG rewards and trade in for an SPG one. Would definitely be back again. </DOC> We stayed two nights in a junior suite. The room was well appointed and very clean. Breakfast had a nice selection and the club lounge was pleasant. Staff were very friendly. If ever in Muscat again I\u2019d stay here. </DOC> Came for a weekend break from Dubai. Not in the most exciting of areas of Muscat, but well placed for visiting the old part of town, the souq, the corniche. Staff were all extremely helpful and obliging. Recognized as a loyal customer and upgraded to a junior suite. Lovely room, very comfortable and high quality finishings. Had access to the club lounge, which offered a reasonable selection of snacks and soft drinks during the day. Staff were very obliging during happy hour, and kept glasses topped up. Plenty of variety at the breakfast buffet in the main restaurant. Spent some time by the pool, which was nicely shaded and relaxing. Would have no hesitate in recommending and would be be happy to stay here again. </DOC> I understand that the hotel opened recently after a long hiatus (years) and the staff seem very eager to get to work. I am not necessarily a big fan of the Sheraton chain, as it is soulless but the employees here make all the difference. The entrance seems a little confusing to navigate for taxi drivers and it's too far to the souk and the Muttrah so make sure you have transportation in hand for the return as it can be difficult to hail a taxi and there's no Uber service. Overall, I found the food delicious and the rooms in great shape (as they should be for a \"new\" property). </DOC> The hotel has no real charm but it is confortable. Nice pool area and restaurant (slightly overprice). The service was good and the situation is convenient with walking distance to the soul. Free parking .",

Beds are comfortable and internet speed is also very ok. In walking distance to the airport and to the airport train station, but the hotel also provides a free shuttle. </DOC> This hotel is located really close to the Geneva Airport and the Palexpo Conference Center. You can see it was re-newed quite recently to a good & modern standard. The rooms are of a average size, a bit of noise from the other rooms/hallways (not too much) beds are good quality, relaxing sleep. Really nice bathroom with a good pressure shower. Breakfast has a nice spread and certainly the omelette station is a nice extra. All in all a good and convenient, but not exceptional, hotel. </DOC> Stayed for one night on a business trip and will definatly return. Swift service on check-in with a smile. Impeccably clean and well presented room. Easy parking and only 5 mins from the airport....which is difficult to believe as the hotel is very quiet and relaxed. The restuarnt is excellent and the floor staff went above and beyond their duty to make guests cell welcome and cherished. Free wifi woth no problems. If you are looking for a great hotel in Geneva, this is it. </DOC> Stayed here for 1 nigh recently and this is a pretty good hotel for business users. It's really close to the airport and the hotel runs a shuttle bus service that goes every 20 minutes. Room was a reasonable size and overlooked the airport and mountains. Bed was big and sheets/pillows were pretty good. Room was very quiet during the night even though I was close to the lifts. Not a massive amount of spade for a business user but enough. Bathroom was good size with plenty of towels and toiletries. Shower was tricky to get right on the temperature but a consistent heat after that. Breakfast was a combination of hot and cold buffer food with an egg station. Standard hotel fare. Staff were great throughout </DOC> I spent the last night of a recent business trip here since it was so close to the airport. After staying at a hotel in the city on a tight trip budget for five days, this was such a huge upgrade. It offered all amenities, air conditioning, shuttle to the airport, great restaurant, and an ice machine. This would be me first choice if visiting again. </DOC> We recently spent one night at the Crowne Plaza. Complimentary shuttle to and from the airport. We had dinner at the bar and really enjoyed the tapas. Before our flight we had lunch at Seventy5. What a surprise.. the food was absolutely exceptional. Highly recommend. Great if you want a night away before you fly. </DOC> The thought of staying in an airport hotel generally fills me with dread. I have changed my mind . From friendly and helpful hotel staff; a really lovely light and bright room; spacious and luxurious bathroom; and free bus card so you can zip to the city in under 20 minutes - it\u2019s well worth a visit . </DOC> I stayed again in Crowne Plaza hotel Geneva in end of January 2018 for a 4 nights stay. It was again a very good stay in line with the previous experience I had in the hotel. It's a very comfortable hotel, very cosy, convenient, renovated with modern decoration. What I like most is chilling out at the bar area after a long day at work but still, this relaxing moment around drinks, tapas or any other finger foods remains business-oriented as it's a venue perfectly suitable to gather customers, business partners or workmates. I definitely do recommend this hotel if you happen to travel to Geneva for business purpose. It does provide all the standards, the facilities and the convenience any business travellers may require.",

It's a typical hotel aimed at business travellers (in my opinion), and it's comfortable and quiet (even if the shower was either stone cold or boiling hot). I ate breakfast in the club lounge, which was not as good as other CP lounges - I visited for a nightcap one evening and all there was were soft drinks and a TV showing football. I'd still stay here again if in the area. </DOC> Stayed here with a group of colleagues, it wouldnt have been my choice. Close to the airport, with a free shuttle - though expect to wait if there's an airline crew wanting a lift - they get priority. Check in was busy - whilst we waited the shuttle did a further 2 runs.. Room was clean, and modern, and unfortunately, right next to the lifts. Overlooking the street, only blinds, no curtains. There's a little box on the pillow - \"for a good nights sleep\" - they could save on the pillow spray here and provide earplugs. Far enough away from the airport that there's no plane noise, but plenty of road noise. Staff were friendly and helpful; the bar was ok, and the food in the restaurant seemed rather expensive, though maybe that's just Geneva. </DOC> At first there is a shuttle from Geneva airport to the hotel which is great! The driver is very polite and friendly. When checking in they are speedy and we were given a transportation card to travel within Geneva. It\u2019s about 10 minutes to the city Centre. Rooms are quite cosy and nice although it was just a little bit small but for 1 person is enough. Breakfast in the restaurant is nice good selection of food cold and hot food and drinks. It was just a little unfortunate that the room I was staying has a little blockage with the shower drainage. </DOC> I enjoyed my stay here very much. The location is great, minutes from the airport and across the street from the bus stop so it's easy to get about anywhere. The rooms are large and nicely done, the bed is comfortable and the bathroom very nice as well. The only negative is the thermostat in the room only went down to 21 degrees Celsius which is 2 degrees Celsius warmer than I'd like. Other than that, everything was great. The breakfast downstairs was also very good - my over easy eggs were perfect each day! Speaking of breakfast, the fresh squeezed Orange Juice machine is very cool and functional, and the croissants are also fabulous (I jumped off my 'no bread' wagon for this them). If I return to Geneva, I hope to stay here again. </DOC> Great hotel convenient to the airport. Service at the desk was excellent and very friendly. Rooms where excellent. Very handy shuttle bus to and from the airport. My choice for the future when in the area. </DOC> The hotel is conveniently located near the airport and the ballexert mall is within walking distance if you are a fitness fanatic. There is a complimentary shuttle to and from the airport. The rooms are well maintained but the service given to IHG members needs to be a bit more streamlined and improved. I didn't get an upgrade as a spire elite member which was very devastating for my two week stay </DOC> Hotel a short distance from the airport, free shuttle service every 20minutes or so. Rooms of a good size and well appointed, very clean. Club lounge basic food, breakfast poor and evening canapes limited. Breakfasts in the restaurant are charged, even though you may have paid for a club room. Evening meals in the restaurant quite basic. Free voucher for public transport which is excellent, bus service into the city outside the hotel. Staff in club lounge limited, service average. </DOC> Stayed at the Crowne Plaza for two nights. It is certainly one of the better more reasonably priced hotels in Geneva. It is near the airport and whilst use of public transport to get to other parts of Geneva is less easy than some it offers a free shuttle service to and from the airport. The rooms are airy, cool, dark and comfortable. There are two alternatives for eating the 75 restaurant and the bar. The staff are friendly and efficient. An express breakfast is also available in the bar in the mornings.",

The 2 min walk to the terminal combined with very early breakfast and quick check-out makes this a winner. I think most of the rooms have now been renovated and the new design is sleek and stylish. Very good treatment of frequent customers here, I usually receive an upgrade and fruitplatter with water. </DOC> I tried to contact the hotel reception to notify of a late arrival. I waited 50 minutes, listening to their classical music, before someone from the reception answered the phone. Completely unacceptable! </DOC> As so many other reviewers, we ended up here as our flight was delayed and we\u2019d missed our connection. Compared to other airport hotels in other locations, this is one is very good. First of all, it is actually located AT the airport (literally just opposite the street). So no need for longish bus shuttle rides. The hotel itself is quite modern, spacious rooms and friendly service. Taking the flight disruptions aside, we were actually quite pleased with this stay. </DOC> Stated here twice recently, airport hotels are often a bus ride away, to me that doesn't count. This is a 5 min undercover walk, collect your bags and check in. Then when you get there you cannot believe the high standard of rooms and services. Looking online you can save a little but often all you want is not to spend 20mins waiting for transportation then the trip, then check in and having to do it all again in the morning and some charge for that. Walking 5 mins is free. Need an airport hotel in Oslo, stay here. </DOC> We spent two nights here. Loved that the hotel is right next to the arrivals area of the airport. An easy walk. It was also very convenient to get to the train and zip into downtown Oslo and back. The lobby is very attractive, and check-in went smoothly. Our room wasn't quite ready so we ordered wine and relaxed in comfortable chairs while waiting. The room was modern and oh so clean and well-lit. The bathroom was great. The beds and pillows were some of the most comfortable we have every slept on in a hotel! We ate here just once, and it was a group dinner event with a buffet. It was fine. Not particularly memorable. </DOC> The hotel is located a short walk from the Oslo airport terminal. The airport train station is just across the street. You can be in central Oslo in 20 minutes. The check in was fast and friendly. The rooms are large enough, comfortable for working and with a nice bath. My room had a Nespresso machine and a thick robe. The Breakfast buffet was complete with every imaginable food and opened at 5 am so you can eat before an early flight. The bar was lively at night. It is a bit pricey but worth the convenience of walking to your flight. </DOC> Large hotel right next to the airport. The room was large, and the bed comfortable. Breakfast was pretty good, with a large selection of items. The water pressure in the shower was very good. The rooms are soundproofed, and we heard very little noise inside the room. </DOC> I stayed in this property only for one night but it was great. The room was very comfortable. The counter staff very helpful and kind. The breakfast buffet is extraordinary! The wifi was very reliable. The location, if you need to be close to the airport, cannot be beaten, it is across the street. I recommend this hotel hands down.",

Plenty of power outlets. Free WiFi. Functional bathroom with supplied toiletries. Comfortable bed for a good nights sleep before early flight. Breakfast:- wide variety of usual hot and cold options. Good range of fresh fruit. Omelettes available upon request. An anomaly that is difficult to understand in a hotel that specifically caters for international tourists - small issue - there is no toaster- most unusual - unable to make toast which is a very common breakfast request for western tourists. Also something that i find difficult to comprehend. Tea/ coffee mugs in breakfast area have no handles - so when you make coffee/tea unless you wish to have a scalded hand you hold the mug with a napkin?? - makes no sense!! </DOC> We stayed for a night in this hotel on our way from Tromso to Amsterdam. The hotel is practically attached to the airport and we were glad that we changed our booking in the city Radisson Blu hotel. The rooms are good and spacious. While the eating options are very limited and expensive, it is easy to pop out to the airport to try the many options there (the Japanese Restaurant there was very good experience). The staff is very friendly and willing to go the extra mile to help. We did not have breakfast here as we had a very early morning flight. One of the better Airport hotels I have stayed in. </DOC> On the (very) downside if you're staying here on a Sunday, eat somewhere else - only one eating place open, serving a lacklustre, mismatched, not very tasty but expensive buffet with a largely disinterested staff who were hard to catch to order drinks. We'd foolishly chosen to eat there rather than in the city on the strength of a menu seen in the room, but turned out that menu was room service only. A great shame. We were very disappointed with our food and the service. On the upside, pleasant reception staff, the room was fine and the location was good. Breakfast was OK hotel standard. </DOC> Located literally 2 minutes from airport, it is the perfect place to stay for transiting traveler. BUT, you pay a high price for a small accommodation without much charm and ...no bath mat to step on upon exiting shower ...staff said just in Business level rooms ....and bathroom door auto close and no evacator...think steam ...until prop door open with trash can! BUT is convenient! </DOC> Good location with walking distance from the terminal. Arrived at night, busy check-in. Long queue at reception, only 2 people at work. The floor of the recipe was very dirty. Had a standard room. The room itself had a decent size and was equipped with everything I needed. But the cleaning did not seem to be good. Nice bathroom and a good bed. So the hotel did the job. Did not try the breakfast. ClubCarlson Gold, got a snack, bottle of water in room and a welcome letter. No room upgrade this time. </DOC> The location of this hotel makes it extremely easy if you have an early morning flight from Oslo. The room we stayed in was large, clean and very quiet. On check-in the staff, who are very helpful and pleasant advised us to check-in online for our flight, complete bag drop and return for breakfast, we followed their advice and found it worked perfectly. We also enjoyed our evening meal in house. Highly recommend and would stay again. </DOC> If you have a super early morning flight and to not want to spend 1 hour commuting to airport at 3am, totally jetlagged and hit by travel exhaustion before you even have started traveling, then the Radisson Blu Airport Hotel is the perfect place to stay. The rooms are cozy & comfy (forget about charm though), spacious and convenient. The hotel features a restaurant that served good quality food anytime during the day. Rates are correct, really. And you just have to cross the drop off road to reach the airport terminal in less than 2 minutes (walking). </DOC> I am sure other reviewers have noted what we found to be true: this is a perfect combination for Oslo airport arrival and/or departures as well as for using your in-between time for exploring Oslo. On steps from the terminal and downstairs to the fabulous FlyToGet high speed trains to/from Oslo Central Sation...so convenient, reliable fast and inexpensive, especially if you qualify for the Senior rate or other discount tickets.

The room, 2234, is facing toward the train station. The room has an ok size, and the decor is modern. Much more modern than I remember from my last stay. There are free wifi, safe and a mini bar. We discovered that the mini bar was almost empty when entering the room. We informed the staff at the reception, but they said that it would't be a problem when checking out. We were also given the opportunity to change room, which we found to be an overkill as we didn't planned on using the mini bare anyway. Breakfast starts at 0500, which is perfect in order to make early morning flights out of OSL. </DOC> We were between flights and wanted somewhere convenient to stay, the Radisson fitted the bill admirably. The room was well appointed and it was a good Radisson breakfast.airport terminal not faraway with a covered link </DOC> This hotel is a very short (mostly covered) walks from the airport (OSL). Our (upgraded) room was reasonably large and the bath was nice. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. On the downside, there was no bath mat, and only two of each type of towel (usually we have 3 or even 4, despite the fact that there are only two of us). Internet access speeds carried wildly- sometimes access was very good, but other times it slowed to an almost unusable pace. The PCs in the \"business center\" were badly configured, making it very difficult to figure out how to print boarding passes, a big no-no for an airport hotel. The buffet breakfast was very good. </DOC> The location of the hotel can't be faulted being a literal 2 to 3 minutes walk from the terminal and the rooms are certainly very comfortable. We had an early flight out and the location was just perfect for that. The hotel loses points because of less than friendly staff and the fact that the fridge in the room, was turned off when we arrived. To be fair, they were willing to replenish it with cold drinks and water, but it still baffles me why a global brand would find it necessary to cut costs in such a way (I can only assume that the fridge was turned off for cost cutting reasons, can't think of any other). </DOC> I stayed here for one night after a week of skiing in mid-Norway. I arrived back at Oslo airport around noon and wanted a place to stay before flying home the next day. This was a great choice. I was able to drop my stuff off and then take the train into town to do a bit of sightseeing. I didn\u2019t see any signs to get to the hotel so I asked someone at the airport. The entrance is near where you buy the train tickets. If you are have a Radisson club member you get two bottles free water. The room was so comfortable and pretty large. I would definitely stay here again. </DOC> Location is perfect for overnight layovers. The room was ok and everything worked well. Twin beds were small but soft. Note the breakfast finishes unusually early at 9.30. But there is a nice coffee shop downstairs with amazing pastry and sandwiches. </DOC> We stayed for a night when having an early flight next morning in December. Both check in and out was smooth, the room we got was clean, bed comfortable. Included breakfast was with huge variety and of very nice Norwegian standard. We were very satisfied with our stay and will stay in this hotel again. Thank you. </DOC> The hotel itself is pretty standard Radisson. Not so fancy, but just ok. Location is excellent for short stay if you have to wait for connecting flight. Hotel is also really quiet, so no noise from the airport. Had a really nice junior suite which was quite spacious and could easily accommodate the luggage trolley we took from the airport terminal. Bed was too soft, so that's the only minus I have to give. Bathroom was small and a bit outdated, but anyway all worked. Breakfast was quite ok. There were for example smoked salmon, which was really nice surprise.",

        "docs": "We spent one night here in transit at Oslo Airport. It's a very short walk from the terminal building. Check in and out was fairly slow, which wasn't an issue for us but could be an irritation if tired or in a hurry. Our room was modern and tastefully furnished, and looked onto a road around the airport. See photos for a better idea of room. We've previously stayed at the other Oslo Airport hotel and in honesty I probably preferred the other one for having more efficient staff and a room that felt a bit more comfortable - but there isn't a lot to choose between them. If both were priced the same I'd go to Park Inn, but otherwise I would happily return here for a brief stay at Oslo Airport. </DOC> The Radisson Blu at the Oslo Airport is wonderfully convenient from the airport. You can wheel your luggage from the carousel to your room on an airport cart. The hotel is more utilitarian than luxurious - small room, no bathrobe, chintzy towels. Good toiletries, flat screen, free wifi, lots of grounded AC outlets (but European standard only) . Excellent fitness area with sex-serrated saunas in the locker rooms. The breakfast is excellent - meats, cheese, actually soft soft-boiled eggs, great bread, crepes, fruit, juice. The hotel is also very close to the railroad station for trips into Oslo. </DOC> I have stayed here twice because of early flights from Gardermoen. The location is great when you are flying out in the morning. Nice rooms, good bar area, and friendly staff. Breakfast is really great. A minus that some of the rooms have \"indirect\" window, i.e. you look into the hotel and then see daylight through another window. But, not a big deal. Will stay there again next time I have an early flight! </DOC> We needed a place to stay overnight (evening arrival with early morning departure next day). Picked this hotel for its location next to airport. Not attached to airport but just across the arrival area so very brief time (30 seconds) outside. Room size OK for overnight. Beds/pillows were comfortable enough, although not great. Price decent for its location to airport. Could not hear any noise from planes. Coffee, small fridge, safe nice to have. Free internet fast enough. No dresser so would have to live out of suitcase. Generally food in Scandinavia is expensive. But hotel restaurant very expensive so we walked back across to airport to grab a bite (albeit only pizza place was open) to eat. The train station is right next to the hotel, so getting into city center would be very convenient. </DOC> I found the Radisson to be just the ticket for an airport stopover. The location is across from the terminal via a short covered walkway (currently under renovation) and next to the airport train station with direct trains to the city in just over 20 mins. Check in and out was simple and painless, my room was newly decorated and spotlessly clean. There was excellent soundproofing and a lovely comfy bed. Breakfast offered a varied but somewhat unusual mix of food, not much in the cereal department but plenty of meats and breads and fresh OJ. Great choice for OSL or using the train to teach other places after a night stop. </DOC> Stayed here for 2 nights whilst attending a conference. It\u2019s ideal for the airport,literally a 2 min walk from arrivals-reception area is nice,drinks are expensive (heh it\u2019s Norway),rooms are well sound proofed. Rooms and the bathrooms are dated,so I wouldn\u2019t want to be here for a week.TV has some English channels,usual minibar etc. Does the job,nice staff so won\u2019t offend. </DOC> Standard rooms and surprisingly quiet for an airport hotel - almost completely silent which was a huge plus. Stayed for a quick night prior to flying out the next morning. The staff was friendly, check-in took no time (even though there was a queue) and check-out was quick and painless. Breakfast area was a bit too crowded and expensive for the selection offered. All in all, not bad for a short stay. I would not recommend for any other reasons other than needing a place to spend the day/night prior to flying. </DOC> Right by the terminal, comfortable and clean. Gym was much better than some hotels. Breakfast was plentiful and tasty. If you want to go down town the train is just outside the door, not that you heard it in the rooms.",

A new favorite for future travel! </DOC> I've just completed a three night stay at the Sheraton and had another pleasant experience! From check in to check out, the staff were courteous and helpful. My SPG/Marriott Platinum status was recognized at check in, leading to an upgrade to a premium room overlooking Hyde Park. I also received access to the Club Lounge on the 21st floor which included an impressive (daily) breakfast and evening canap\u00e9 spread.

In the meantime the hotel has been upgraded to a Sheraton Grand and it is centrally located with Hyde park views. This time I received a nice & quiet room at the 11th floor. The lounge is really cool and the breakfast is great, but this time the staff really wowed me. After a 26 hour trip from Brussels I arrived around 9 PM at the hotel. As business meetings started early the following day I wanted just a glass of red wine before I wanted to catch some sleep. The lounge was about to close and the receptionist offered me to bring a glass of wine to my room. Literally 5 minutes later a full bottle of wine was delivered. This little things are really appreciated. </DOC> I stayed here for a conference and was surprised by just how popular this hotel was .I couldn\u2019t fault any aspect during my stay.The unlimited seafood at the lunch buffet was a highlight.Room was clean and comfortable </DOC> Great room with a corner view overlooking warships in the harbour for Anzac Day. Easy access to Hyde Park, shops and restaurants. Very pleasant staff, especially in the Sheraton Club. Great pool and spa. Altogether a wonderful business weekend. </DOC> Very happy with our choice in Sydney. Lovely comfortable, new and quiet room. Pool and business lounge very nice . Great views. Perfect location for visiting shops and major sites. Public transport( buses and underground ) located directly across the road and no shortage of taxis. Spent 4 nights here and will definitely return. Very friendly and professional staff (in particular the Concierge)",

Beds were very comfortable and it was great to have so much space. Check in was easy and concierge were very helpful. All staff through the hotel were always smiling and happy to help. Its in a great location, you can walk to everything in the city. Wi Fi was complimentary and very reliable. I didn't expect this hotel to be so good and will happily stay here again. </DOC> I have stayed at this hotel 6-8 times in the past on almost every trip I make to Sydney, because of its central location to most everything the city has to offer. However, I was disappointed on this stay, because the hotel still wants to charge you for in room wifi. In 2015, their is rarely a hotel that still charges for this. I am a Starwood Preferred Member, and because I booked the room through a link to Trip Advisor, they would not extend the complimentary wifi. I even wrote a handwritten note to Guest Services, to no avail. Aside from that, I still like the Sheraton, rooms are great, keep very clean and they have nice showers. Lobby is bustling and lots of activity. Location is very good. </DOC> a typical business hotel. But the hotel needs an update. No sound proofing rooms. If the room is on low floor, street noise is well heard, due to single class windows. Rooms are good sized and with all necessary amenities. Staff is friendly. Breakfast buffet is great. Location of hotel as well is perfect to explore the city and be close to all malls/shopping area. </DOC> We had a great time during our recent stay here! From our check in with a very personable and kind Receptionist, originally from Guangzhou in China to our departure with an equally lovely guy, originally from Madeira, everything went swimmingly. And speaking of swimming- the 22/F Rooftop Pool was as impressive as ever! My son and I had several sessions there. We loved our room (1413). It even had slivers of harbour views. The 21/F Club had undergone an impressive makeover and the drinks and snacks service commencing at 5 pm, was amazing! Upon the occasion of our departure on Valentine's Day we were fortunate to coincide with the launch of the Bonvoy Club. The champagne and cake was a most serendipitous surprise! </DOC> I arrived with no ID, cash or physical credit cards. Their payment machines do not take tap payments from a mobile phone. Not a problem. Even allocate me an amazing executive suite with Hyde Park view. Thank you for that. </DOC> Have stayed here before the hotel is well located facing the Park and very close to the main shopping areas Check in was ok and i was reconised as SPG gold member only thing is that ended up paying for an upgrade to a slghtly bigger room which i thought was strange Effecient checkout will probably stay here again when next in Sydney </DOC> Stayed at the Sheraton Grand Hyde Park, unfortunately for only one night. We weren't told but we must of been given an upgrade to a suite. The room was just amazing - cannot fault anything. For such a busy hotel all the staff were fantastic. Thank you all for such a wonderful one night stay. </DOC> We recently stayed for the weekend, great location, especially if you want to be in the CBD, easy to get the train from the airport as the hotel is only 200m from st. James station. Room was good well appointed. I was disappointed with overpriced buffet breakfast",

However the buffet was set up with different stations for the various types of food. Perfect. The only downfall was that although we had booked in advance, the host could not find our booking. Fortunately, she was able to show us to a table. Our waitress was friendly and professional. Would dine there again. I deducted 1 star for the booking error. </DOC> Great location if your needs are CBD / financial area. Close to rail and bus routes, easy to get to Opera House where we had a theatre night. Top attributes are rooftop pool and the executive lounge, one of the better ones in Australia for views and service. Always full so upgrades are difficult. A slight niggle is the door staff typically wait till we have unloaded a car and then ask if they can help - a bit late by that time </DOC> This is the place to stay, just a block from the Eye of Sydney, a 10-15 minute walk to The Opera House... Many things to see and do all in walking distance plus a train station across the street to access underground. You have restaurants and bars on site, so no need to venture out for this. </DOC> Service and rooms are all top notch. Location is great, just minutes from the Harbor and lots of restaurants around. Fitness facility has a great view of Sydney. Taxis abound and staff again impeccable in their service even at 6 in the morning. The room was spacious and well appointed. It was the best worry free stay I've had in a long time. </DOC> Really enjoyed our family stay at the Sheraton on the Park in Sydney. We were offered a suite as part of our 17th Anniversary celebration and we loved it. The hotel offers wonderful views over Hyde Park but also the city. Very nice Sheraton Club Lounge from where you can also take wonderful pictures of the city. Highly recommend. </DOC> I have stayed here many times over the years and have already reviewed this hotel favorably but felt it was worth another post after my recent stay. I was given one of the newly refurbished rooms and must say I was very impressed. Lovely decor with more user friendly access to power points and coffee making facilities. Whilst not often a huge room service user I did so this time and it featured a new menu with quite a number of new items blended with old favorites.They have also upgraded the club lounge as well and is very nice indeed. The staff here have always been excellent and this trip was no different. Well worth the money for an excellent 5 star experience. </DOC> This hotel does not disappoint. Amazing location and easy walking access to CBD, park space, train system...fantastic. The property is very classic in styling and modern in services. staff were delightful and rooms were terrific! </DOC> This hotel is well situated in the centre of Sydney with easy access to shopping, the harbour, Hyde Park, the museums and everything Sydney has to offer. The hotel staff provide friendly efficient service. The rooms need an update-they are looking tired.",

Breakfast a bit pricey at $44 but has everything, really fresh and really high end, so I did feel I got my money's worth. Late night bar not unpleasant either. Check in/out very prompt. Recommended. </DOC> Service at check in great, at check out great, you feel really welcome in this place. Has a laundry service, you can control the room temperature, the Wifi works and is part of the deal. Lovely walks through the park to the office. Rooms are up to date, linen and pillows are first class - staying again next week. </DOC> This hotel has great service, an excellent location and beautiful apportioned rooms. I was upgraded spontaneously to an executive suite which was just a great gesture and very welcome after a week of business travel. The room rate was competitive. Definitely a hotel that I will keep on my list of favourites. </DOC> We spent 5 nights, paid for 4 all on points. Park view King. I think the park view made the stay nicer. We took the Breakfast in the restaurant as our amenity. The hotel is very well located and close to just about everything. The hotel has a VERY large gym which we enjoyed. The pool is small and inside. The Club lounge is solid and they really served a lot of food at the 5 to 7 hours with cocktails. We didn't get up there much. The best thing about this hotel is that everyone was so darn friendly! We're frankly not used to it. You folks in Sydney must have something in the water! Seriously the staff was professional at every interaction we had. Can't ask for better then that. </DOC> The staff are all great and helpful. The breakfast buffet has the widest range. Really like the noodle bar. Rooms are large and comfortable. The pool and gym available to be enjoyed but I went to the bar instead. Lovely service. Thank you. </DOC> A grand hotel in the heart of Sydney. Would definitely come back. Due to it's quality and standard of service, it does get busy at times. Check-in was busy. + Spacious rooms, grand classic Sheraton style + Easy access to the airport (train or taxi) + Walkable to the main areas of Sydney city (Prefect for us, as it was our first visit to Sydney.) + Definitely get access to the lounge if you can, on top of the good service it has a beautiful view over Hyde Park. + A full equipped gym + A good breakfast spread, having a lot of healthy options as well. </DOC> Love it for location, pool and lounge but as always, there is something to spoil the visit. Appreciated the upgrade, the suites are spacious and comfortable and easy to work in; the executive lounge is one of Sydney's best with stunning views across the park to the harbour and the swimming pool has similar views with a pool large enough to share with many. The downside though was that the tv's were not working - was trying to watch the updates to the coup but could not get proper vision or audio - the engineer gave up and said they would be fixed in a couple of days. </DOC> An excellent hotel, I was there at a conference. Huge room, high up, quiet, which could be an issue as it is between Main Street. Goog breakfast buffet. Excellent rooftop pool and spa, you can sit out too. Conference rooms are underground and a bit dinged, but work well. The hotel is right on the park, and you can walk easily everywhere. A great venue",

The hotel may need a bit of refreshing but overall I felt it was a good business hotel close to everything. I enjoyed the business lounge at the top with great views. Service was good too. Price is in line with other Sydney properties, that is, a bit pricey. </DOC> It has been 2 years since my last visit and it was great to come back. Got a nice room with park view, that\u2019s where you want to stay. The TV is very big and can be watched from any angel. Bed is fantastic, I slept very well. Breakfast was upper busy and the service very poor, order 2 coffee immediately to make sure to get coffee. Get a room without connecting door, the sound proofing is very poor. </DOC> Great staff and a wonderful newly renovated room 2010. Would highly recommend this hotel if you are staying in Sydney. Breakfast is very good both buffet and lounge if you have access. Go for it !!!!!! </DOC> Could this be the best all round hotel in Sydney? You couldn't ask for a better location on Hyde Park and walkable to all the main places in the town centre. The staff were helpful and courteous and the club lounge was very good. It could do with more dining options but there are so many eateries nearby that it is not really an issue. I recommend an early morning jog from the hotel up to the Opera House, round to Mrs Macquarie's Chair and back down along the water and back through the park to the hotel. Taking it easy it is about 30-40 minutes. </DOC> We stay in this hotel 6 days , the room are nice and newly decorated , but service terrible and don\u2019t take club floor !!! Because it\u2019s very dirty and impossible to have a table for breakfast or evening , it\u2019s like a cantine for school ! Table are dirty and no one clean !!! This hotel should have 3 or 4 stars no more . Last point , staff have no respect of guest and no respect of platinum elite guest . </DOC> The rooms are one of the best in Sydney in terms of size, comfort and decor. Room was on 12th floor with a view facing into another building but I was only there for 1 night so it didn't matter. Service was efficient and friendly. Ordered room service for breakfast and was impressed with both the quality and portion sizing of the meal. This is hands down one of Sydney's finest properties to stay at! </DOC> My second stay at Sheraton on the Park. First after the refurbishment. I have to say they\u2019ve done a great job doing the hotel up. The room became so much more modern. There\u2019s a few things I appreciate more than a giant ring light mirror in the bathroom! Love love love. The location is unbeatable. Westfield, Pitt St Mall and QVB all within walking distance. Our family even enjoyed the leisurely walk to Darling Harbour and back. Also to Chinatown. I love that it\u2019s so close to the quiet St James Station at Hyde Park. And I went to the park every morning of my stay. Just lovely. </DOC> Excellent location directly opposite Hyde Park and 2 minute walk to busy Pitt Street Mall. Close to all the CBD highlights (Darling Harbour, the Quay and the Rocks, QVB). From the Executive Club lounge the view across Hyde Park and to the Sydney heads is truly magnificent. This was our first stay since the recent renovations and we were so impressed. Room was very modern and well appointed. This is truly 5 star, and the service and hospitality was equally impressive. We had the seafood buffet at their Feast Restaurant which was excellent.",

        "docs": "I usually stay within a block of the harbor and wondered how it would be a little further in town, No problem. The St. James train station was right across the street from the hotel (super convenient if taking the train in from the airport) plus there were scores of buses at the St. James bus stop. Hotel itself was very busy and noisy on ground floor, but check in/out was fast. I spent very little time in the hotel but it met all expectations. </DOC> Pros: newly renovated gorgeous spacious well appointed rooms. Club lounge is phenomenal with attentive and perfect service- the best I\u2019ve ever seen and worth every penny. Gym is also newly renovated with modern equipment and is really clean and nice. 5 stars all around. Cons: the hotel is not finished with the renovation yet so be sure to get a room that is far enough away from the construction noise. We had a small noise issue but the management was amazingly helpful in accommodating us and making us feel valued as guests. We will definitely be back! </DOC> I stayed for a business trip and this hotel met all my expectations. The room was spacious with a large bathroom, seperate lounge and kind size bed. The room was well maintained and very clean, housekeeping staff do a wonderful job.The outlook was disappointing as the window looked out to an internal roof and other buildings. The room didn\u2019t seem to be that well sound proofed as I was awoken on both nights by noises in adjoining rooms but it was World Cup week when I stayed. The hotel is located in a central position across from the park and close to Pitt street mall and the main shopping precinct. </DOC> I normally like Sheraton but this hotel was way overpriced. Having ordered Kong-Size Bed and getting rooms with two single beds is not acceptable and the excuse of having been booked out was quite lame. Anyway, the room was good and I've enjoyed my stay. Breakfast starting at 7.00am is too late for a business hotel so I missed out and the dinner was pricey and quite average. Parking for 55$ / night + 10$ for valet is completely over the top and then having a valet guy not really looking after you and making you feel unwelcome (I've probably disturbed him in his morning relaxation) is not great considering the price. Will definitely not stay there again. There are much better hotels in Sydney at lower prices with friendlier staff </DOC> The hotel has become a bit tired, but from a business hotel perspective it works well (other than not having free wifi in the rooms). The hotel is a short 5-minute walk to St Martin's Place and the main office buildings and is near restaurants and shopping of Queen Victoria Building and Westfields. For exercise, one can run through the park across the street to the gardens/coastline/Opera House, and the gym is very good - lots of different equipment. The hotel would be a lot better if it was refurbished - the style is dated and the bathroom fixtures are a notch below luxury. </DOC> Great stay at this awesome hotel. The room was very big. And the balcony was even bigger. So nice. The location is great and close to everything. Shopping, food and site seeing is right outside your door. Hotel is also close to pubic transportation. Great stay! </DOC> Even though the hotel seems to be a bit outdated the rooms and the lobby are kept pretty in shape. I was lucky to get one of the new refurbished rooms. The room was quite big with the usual SPG standard bedding. The Bathroom was also huge and had all amenities. The location is somewhere between Circular Quay and the Rydges World Tower. So you are in middle of the Sydney downtown hustle bustle. </DOC> Stayed at this Sheraton for a busy Friday night. We were given a family room with one king bed and two single beds for some reason. Room like this would be so useful for a family stay. Room is big, very clean and everything met the standard of Sheraton apart from the slippers in the room, which looks cheap and really can only be used once or twice... Beds and pillows are very comfortable and high quality. Bathroom has a good size as well. Amenities in the bath room are great to use, too. The only thing bothered me during my stay is the banning noises from the corridor the next morning. I know it is just the housekeepers doing their job but I really wish they can keep the noise minimum during early morning. After all, this is Sheraton.",

The shuttle bus was no longer available after 11pm so we took a cab over. The room was pretty nice so it\u2019s worth the price. </DOC> Decided to stay this time at the Pullman Brisbane Airport Hotel instead of the Ibis, which is right next door. The room is very comfortable, as is the bed. All the usual complimentary items provided, including a pod coffee machine for lovers of coffee. Having stayed at both the Pullman, this time and the Ibis, I don't really think it is worth an extra hundred for the experience. </DOC> Stayed here pre flight and enjoyed the executive lounge level and the 2 hour wine or beer with some nibbles as part of the stay with free buffet breakfast all day drinks fruit etc Dinner here on the expensive side so we ate at the Ibis next door it was packed Beds are so comfortable and staff are pleasant </DOC> I choose the Pullman\u2019s as they have an Executive lounge and I know what to expect. It is the advantage of being a loyal Accor member for 19 years. This is a comfortable hotel but I was confused by the lack of food in the Exec Lounge at 5:30. So I had to go back and read the instructions. Instead. We were provided free drinks and a platter at the bar. The platter doesn\u2019t suit vegetarians. It is a bit of a compensation but not quite. The beauty of the Exec Lounge is that it is quiet. Having drinks and nibblies in the bar is noisy. A bit disappointing. </DOC> Stayed here pre flight great location though their dinner meals are way to expensive instead we went to the Ibis next door and got great well priced good I would consider staying there next time as well </DOC> If you need one night at the airport, this place was perfect. We arrived late at night at the domestic terminal and it was about a 10 minute walk over to the hotel. Signage could be better but that is up to the airport more than the hotel. Once we got there, staff was efficient and helpful. The room was new, clean, modern, quiet and comfortable. (But if one person is sleeping while the other is up, the bathroom light floods the whole room and no way to block it.) In the morning we caught the shuttle over to the international terminal and no issues. Prices seemed high for an airport hotel but otherwise I would stay here again if I needed to be at the airport. </DOC> Extremely close to both the domestic and international terminals,very convienent room was clean and large, the staff was very friendly and helpful will stay again very soon.. highly recommend to anyone travelling </DOC> Stayed in between flights on our way to Japan. The room was spacious and well appointed. Booking an executive rooms gives access to the lounge and a two hour complimentary drinks and snacks at the Apron Bar. With wine at $16 a glass you soon save the extra on the room.",

The restaurant was very busy, which was good to see, as we always enjoy our evening meals here. Breakfast however has gone down in standard. The only negative comment I have is , at check in, as an Accor member, I had to ask for our drink vouchers. This should be automatic. </DOC> I checked out the new Pullman hotel near the Brisbane Domestic Airport. Very spacious and well appointed, the bed was just perfect. I booked here with the Executive Lounge access. The lounge is unlike any other Pullman hotel that I have used. The lounge has an outlook over the runway, but guests have access to food in the ground floor bar area. The Apron Restaurant dinner menu was delicious. The only thing that was missing was the canap\u00e9s- I certainly don\u2019t class a small bowl of prawn crackers as Canap\u00e9s. I spoke to staff re this and they will look into the missing canap\u00e9s! </DOC> A five min walk from the arrivals at Brisbane airport. Staff were extremely helpful and the rooms were great. I could see the planes taking off and landing but couldnt hear them.Bathroom was more than i expected and the bed was extremely comfortable. I had dinner at the bar and it was very nice. I have no complaints except for the $100 hold on my card. Seems excessive. </DOC> Stayed overnight before a super early domestic flight. What a treat, friendly welcoming staff and a well appointments comfortable room. Only wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the services. Ate a relaxed dinner at next door Cribb cafe which was pretty good too </DOC> Pullman Airport is the best option as far as it comes to airport hotels in Brisbane, however, it is not in a walking distance from neither arrivals nor departures! I suggest that you take a shuttle bus (5 dollars, paid before or on the bus) to get there and back. Room quality-very high. Staff-friendly, helpful. Gym - small, but functional. Breakfast-acceptable. </DOC> A 6.00 am flight necessitated an overnight stay at Pullman. AS usual, the standard across all the Pullman Hotels is very high. Reception staff were wonderfully welcoming and efficient and the rooms are very clean and well kept. Access to the Executive Room on L10 provides a quiet spot to enjoy drinks and canapes No free wifi unfortunately (come on Pullman) and no English breakfast tea, only Celon breakfast tea and herbals. Up at 5.00, out for a smoke, no balconies, arranged morning papers and free airport shuttle. All excellent. </DOC> We dropped into the Pullman Hotel for dinner at the Apron restaurant. We would have stayed here if we knew the hotel was recently opened. We totally enjoyed our dinner as the food was delicious & the restaurant offered a classy ambience with outstanding staff. The Pullman is located just within the airport precinct. Just a few minutes drive away from the domestic airport. Overall - A brand new hotel offering first class amenities, fitness centre, pool , parking & restaurant. We look forward to staying here next time we visit Brisbane. </DOC> My husband and I stayed as we had an early morning flight, we drove to the hotel and parked in the undercover hotel's parking. We found that the walk to the hotel reception from the carpark was a little confusing and long. The Reception area was cold and uninviting, there was one chair in the whole area so whilst waiting to be attended to only one person could sit. The reception staff were friendly. Loved the club area that was situated at the lobby floor bar, an appertiser plate was served and you were able to order beer or house wine from the bar free of charge if you book club access. I felt that the bar was a little understaffed as the 2 girls there were multitasking with restaurant bookings and serving of food. The room was comfortable and quiet, I would stay again.",

Very helpful staff. </DOC> Its a new Hotel well appointed, located at the Domestic Airport with a Shuttle every 40 minutes to both Domestic and the International Airport. The fare is $5 per person and it is quick and easy, my trip in a taxi for the same journey with a morose driver cost $14.80. If you have the time, wait for the Shuttle, its quick and easy. Make sure you have a booking and be early as sometime there is more luggage than space. You don't want to be left out. </DOC> Located a short walk from the domestic terminal and a short shuttle ride to the international terminal. New property, very clean, helpful staff and good sized rooms. Everything you need for travel. There is a restaurant downstairs but it\u2019s a bit pricey. Regular shuttle service for $5 to international terminal via domestic. Perfect for a good nights rest before early international travel. </DOC> Excellent location, only a brief 8 minute leisurely stroll from the domestic terminal at the Brisbane airport, we enjoyed a restful night there. Quiet room, and nice breakfast. Recommended for layover transiting Brisbane. </DOC> If you want a touch of luxury during your brief transit at Brisbane Airport, the Pullman is excellent. Easy and friendly check-in; a great spacious and QUIET room and large bathroom. I ordered room service - it was fast and generous (the largest Caesar salad I ever had!!!). Highly recommended if in transit; its a 5-10 minute walk from the domestic terminal and a shuttle for $5 takes you to the international teerminal </DOC> Really enjoyed our overnight stay. Lovely greeting on entry and exit, staff are very pleasant. A short walk from the domestic airport, a quick check in and up to the room, that is very well appointed. Very comfortable, a large open bathroom, with, I am pleased to say, a seperate shower and toilet. Good sound proofing made for a very comfortable night before a big travel day. We will return again. </DOC> I like this new hotel. I like the style with huge floor to ceiling windows with views out to the river in the distance and cool decor. While I was staying there was a huge electrical storm and the double glazing meant that I had a good view of the storm but the thunder did not keep me awake. The plane traffic couldn\u2019t be heard either. I like the clouded glass sliding walls into the tiled bathroom too. It is an easy walk to the domestic terminal.

FYI - Vegemite is absolutely disgusting if you dont know how it should be prepared. Hotel location in South Bank was ideal, close to many restaurants. Friendly helpful staff.

If required as the hotel had a great choice of bars and restaurants. The pool was a great area to kick back and relax. Our room had a great view of Brisbane and the river. Would highly recommend a stay here. </DOC> Room was very quiet, had a comfy bed, good tv channels and reception and free wifi. So many food choices nearby and the breakfast I had in the ground level cafe was also very good. Friendly reception and checkout team topped off a short Brisbane stay. Recommended hotel in Southbank. </DOC> Rydges is in a great location near South Bank. Ask for a quiet room if you are staying on a Saturday or Sunday night as the bar can be noisy. Lovely restaurant called Bacchus on site. Staff all very professional and friendly. Would definitely stay again. </DOC> As the title said it is just okay, the rooms are excellent, the staff are friendly and helpful but the bars shut by 10 ish and the breakfast is poor AUS$40 and the selection was poor. I wouldn\u2019t stay again </DOC> Needed a hotel close to the trade show hall and to the \u201caction\u201d for the evening. This ticks all the boxes. The hotel is clean and well maintained. Staff on the whole good, some a bit - meh, but the rest were great. Ate in the Backaus restaurant- amazing. But every day we went out for breakfast, loads of good coffee shops and bars serving breakfast. They also have a cafe on the ground floor, CBD, great coffee, food disappointing. </DOC> Stayed on business for a conference. Took 45 minutes driving around the block looking for hotel carpark, then realised its under construction and had to pay additional valet at hotel to park. No other option close by. Room was good, clean and of modern standard. Best thing was snakes in minibar. Worst thing was paying $39 for bacon and eggs in the restaurant for breakfast after I explained to the waiter that's all I want.....sorry but that really annoyed me! There's got to be some flexibility!",

        "docs": "Stayed overnight recently for business. Stayed in a superior twin room. I chose this hotel over the other Mantra due to the size of the beds (Mantra was single beds). I was blown away by the size of the room and very happy to see two double beds which were very comfortable. The room was ever so spacious, clean and comfortable. The staff were extremely helpful especially with our luggage and valet car parking. We had breakfast in the cafe downstairs (not included). Was basic and a tad expensive but convenient and quick which was what we were after. Was a short walk to Griffith University where we were attending a workshop. Was the perfect location for restaurants (so many dining options!) and bars and the ambiance of South Bank. Would stay here again and again! </DOC> I am a regular here and the hotel rooms were looking a bit dated. The current refit has made the rooms look very modern. Its a complete refit int he rooms with the entire bathroom redesigned and the rooms. Decor is excellent. I have to say the rooms are now as nice as other 5 star hotels in Brisbane. The refit has not finished on all floors yet. Close to city, convention centre, and of course Southbank and the made made beach. A really good update. </DOC> We were upgraded to a room with a view of the city which was a nice surprise. Very friendly guy at Reception who checked us in fast and easy. The room was a nice size and with all the amenities one would need for an overnight stay. Parking was $40 which never sits well with us, but I guess it's a fact of life in cities these days. For dinner we had a quick casual bite to eat in their Caf\u00e9 on the ground floor which was quite nice. Overall we enjoyed our stay and would have no hesitation in returning when next in Brisbane. </DOC> We have stayed at Rydges Southbank for a few years to watch the fireworks - a great view from the top floors . Our extra delight was the unexpected surprise of the gift of room service with a large plate of charcuterie , a plate of huge king prawns , an excellent selection of cheeses plus a bottle of Moet . Thank you Rydges !! </DOC> I had stayed here several yrs ago which was good b/c hotel was nice/new + it was conveniently located to all the bars/cafes of South Bank + discovered that the hotel + room had been fully refurbished so enjoyed another great stay. Check in was quick + room modern/trendy. The bar/restaurant downstairs was good too. Location in the middle of South Bank is still its strongest feature. </DOC> We stayed here for SuperNova. it was incredibly convenient, with almost direct access to the convention centre. We had booked well in advance and just before the time were offered a nicely priced upgrade so took it. Great room service food, however even if in the hotel the o sight restaurant needed bookings pre made for a saturday night:-( Sadly also most of the Southbank restaurants were also booked out (busy weekend). So be re warned BOOK a restaurant! nice room, luxury style fittings. perfect location. </DOC> Stayed here because a conference I was attending was held in the hotel. The rooms are modern and tastefully decorated but the toiletries and amenities in the room was lacking. I had to call room service to get bedroom slippers and toothbrush sets. I thought these were essential basics for any 4 star hotel rooms. The staff were very friendly and helpful. There was a billing error when I was checking out and they were quick to address it quickly. Location wise it was convenient; 7 mins walking distance to the train station that connects to the airport. All in all a typical business/conference hotel. </DOC> Stayed 3 nights for a conference held at the convention centre which is next door. Comfortable clean room with usual amenities. Easy access to all Southbank has to offer including the Arts centre, Galleries and FOOD. Free Wifi is a bonus and staff particularly friendly and helpful. Have stayed here previously and is good value.",

The staff are friendly and helpful and the location is central if heading over the river by car or foot or staying on south bank. I didnt try the roof top bar but it looked amazing. I will definitely be back on my next business trip and would stay here if in Brisbane for a holiday. </DOC> We recently had a 2 night stay in a Deluxe Queen room and it was wonderful. The rooms are very spacious and the bed is fantastic! The bathroom is a little small but very clean. The views were great and we had a generous size balcony with 2 chairs. I was a bit surprised that we didn't have an outdoor table, but I'm sure that if I had asked for one I would have received it. All the staff were very helpful and friendly. I would love to stay there again. </DOC> Visited with work and stayed a couple of nights. Hotel generally good but did notice a fair bit of noise during my stay. Room comfortable and had all the necessities. Good shower. Breakfast in cafe - lovely staff and good toast - which if you are from the UK is probably classed as cake! High octane. </DOC> Alway s visity this time of year , worth 4.5 stars , but prices were up a little this year , excellent position for Family s right next to the SouthBank Park Lands , River , swimming etc , we were there for family , who live locally , firework s , an easy walk into the City </DOC> We stopped for a couple of days in Brisbane before heading to the Gold Coast for a function and chose to stay at Rydges South Bank. Its a nice spot and a great venue with lovely rooms etc (get a suite if you can they are worth the upgrade) and right in the middle of a little oasis on the edge of Brisbane proper. Plenty of restaurants and bars and enough to do to keep you occupied for a few days...and a short walk to the CBD. </DOC> I was pleasantly surprised with my stay here, it was more than I was expecting. The staff were so friendly on arrival. There was a poblem with my room as the bed was broken and without hesitation they moved me to another room and apologised, even offering a bottle of wine (I declined but it was a nice gesture). The breakfast was OK, needs improvement, I would have liked to try the outdoor one but weather was bad and it was not open. The rooms were surprisingly large which I did not expect. Location in Southbank was good and easily walkable. </DOC> Stayed in a king suite on floor 7. Suite was expansive and well equipped. The hotel is well placed to experience the attractions of Southbank parklands and close enough to walk to Brisbane's CBD either via the Victoria or Goodwill bridges. I found staff were efficient, attentive and non intrusive. Of particular note was the efficiency of the Valet parking arrangements. </DOC> I could not complain It's all that you'd want from a hotel if you're travelling on business It's close to the Southbank dining and arts precinct and the city, and has spacious clean rooms and friendly staff I have stayed since and would stay again",

        "docs": "We stayed here for 2 nights early August 2017. Suite was very comfortable, the facilities clean and functional. Excellent location and we used valet facility for our hire car. Short walk to tram and over the road to the. 705 bus which we caught to Pacific Fair shopping centre. Restaurants were both first class. Attended presentation at. Marriott Vacation Club, well done professional. Pool area outstanding. Pleased to recommend. We regularly stay at Marriott Vacation Clubs using exchanges. Thoroughly enjoyed our time here have reviewed Citrique and Misono independently but enjoyed both very much. </DOC> I stayed at the Marriott while attending a conference there and enjoyed the experience. It's one of those hotels with a keen attention to detail that manages to get even the little things right. The service was, without exception, exemplary. Staff can't do enough for you. The rooms are modern, spotlessly clean and the beds/pillows among the most comfortable I've experienced. The location, just a few minutes walk from the centre of Surfers Paradise, is also very close to the beach. Certainly not at the budget end of the scale but worth every cent. </DOC> The room rate in Gold Coast in Dec/Jan could be scary, but you get what you pay for. The hotel room was typical Marriott, but the pool was truly a plus. In the salted pool, you can even semi-experience the ocean and diving, which is actually quite useful for young kids. During our stay, we had dinner twice at the in-house restaurant, and we encountered problems with our order both times, one for missing one of our order, and another time we were just left out with no one even bothered to stop by to see why we were sitting there and waiting. Even though both situation got solved safe and sound, but more management training and customer care could be used. </DOC> I've been a fan of Marriott for a while. The property at the Gold Coast is as good as any I've stayed in. The staff were well up to standard, attentive and thoughtful. The food was consistently good. Marriott look after all their guests but give even more attention to their platinum members. The hotel's convenient for the beach and local shops. Highly recommended. </DOC> Great hotel, lovely helpful and friendly staff The pool area is great for the kids with daily fish feeding in the beach pool. There is also a water slide fun area but this was closed during our stay. A kids club is also available but we didn't use it this visit Excellent breakfast buffet and again the kids are provided with their own coloured plastic plates, bowls etc if they want them. Would definitely recommend and would absolutely stay again! </DOC> This is our second visit to this hotel within 12 months. We have thoroughly enjoyed both stays in this very up-market establishment. Rooms are very comfortable, beautifully presented, well maintained and with views ranging from very pleasant to fantastic. The pool area is stunning. The facilities are outstanding. The restaurant is excellent, and lighter meals are available at the poolside bar. In-room dining offers a good menu choice. The staff in every section of the hotel we experienced were warm, friendly, courteous and totally customer focused in the best possible way. The whole holiday experience leaves you with the desire to stay for longer or to come back as soon as possible. A fabulous experience in a welcoming environment. Well done and thank you Marriot Surfers Paradise. Special thanks to Katerina at Reception and to the staff of the Citrique Restaurant. </DOC> Last stayed here about 15 years ago. We stayed in an unusual pentagonal-shaped room, which was busy with different, and somewhat impractical furnishings, such as a table with 2 seats wedged between the TV and window...no chance of two people sitting together. However, this property isn't about the rooms alone. The pool area is great, and the BBQ adjacent to the bar produces very tasty food for a modest price. Service was friendly and helpful. I understand the hotel is 25 years old now; a bit of a spruce up of the rooms would certainly get it to a higher rating. </DOC> The rooms are very very old and dated, however very comfortable. The service overall is very good specially the valet. Breakfast is just awful with so many people. However you have some very nice views.",

Has nice looking buffet breakfast but food and service - while fine - don\u2019t quite match the surrounds. Highligh has to be the lobby, bar and pool area. Great space and kids. Rooms are on the large side with nice views of the river or sea. Would stay again. </DOC> We went \u2018north\u2019 to escape the NSW winter - -and stayed at the Marriott. It was a pleasant hotel with very helpful staff; good service and excellent accomodation. It is conveniently located for exploring the local sights. Recommended. </DOC> Only stayed one night before a flight out of Gold Coast. The hotel was easily the highlight of the stay as we did not particularly enjoy Surfers or the Gold Coast after a week in Byron Bay. The hotel was fantastic and the staff was great, views were wonderful, pool was fun! Breakfast was very good, easy parking. Couldn't really find any fault! </DOC> Amazing 5 stars resort. The room have a lovely view of Surfers Paradise. Room was spacious with a really comfy bed. Staff was friendly helpful and nice which make a pleasant stay. 7 mins walk brings you to the tram stop where you can go to Pacific Fair and you can hop on and off just by buying a day ticket which cost $10 fro the visitors counter. </DOC> This is a genuine resort hotel, situated just north of the center of Surfers Paradise. The hotel offers attractive resort facilities, including pools and an outdoor spa. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. There are several dining options, including a popular seafood buffet. The hotel has excellent conference facilities, which make it an ideal base for a convention. The highlight of the establishment is the uniformly high standard of courteous and professional hospitality delivered by the staff. This is an excellent hotel for either a vacation or for a business conference. </DOC> I hadn't been there for a while and I got reminded why I use to go so often in the past. The food, the service and quality was amazing. Great experience all around. I would highly recommend. Easy to access also with great parking facilities and also on the tram line too. </DOC> Excellent swimming pool, really unique, reception, breakfast and staff in general pretty attentative, friendly and nice, executive lounge is small and really not posh, just fulfills the idea, breakfast buffet is good and for Australia a good one... </DOC> Attended a luncheon at the Marriott yesterday - easy parking and the function room was well attended by hotel staff for audio visual and sound functions. Meal was constantly refilled (curry and rice and condiments) by attentive waiters. The hotel is a large one with attractive and open areas with flagstone floor in the foyer. It has its own beach and pool with tropical fish so guests can swim with them... food was excellent and the whole experience was good.",

Faultless. Having a very spacious suite helped too. 2 bathrooms, closet, big living room. Breakfast was very good too. Truly enjoyable for a short stay. </DOC> I've stayed at this hotel several times and have never been disappointed. The staff is friendly upon entrance. The rooms are always clean and comfortable. The food is always done to perfection. The whole hotel has a comfortable feeling to it. </DOC> First time in Prague and I couldn't of picked a better Hotel. The location is right in the heart of Prague. Walking distance to most sights and the trams and metro are very close. The Hotel has a Beautiful Lobby and Very Friendly Service.. Everyone was helpful and spoke English which was a plus for us. The rooms were large, well appointed and spotless. Upgrade to the Executive Lounge. Well worth the money. Breakfast, afternoon deserts and evening finger food with wine and beer. Soft drinks coffee and tea all through out the day. Spent 9 nights and this Marriott made our trip special. </DOC> Ive stayed here regularly and said that the two unique things about it was the location and the fitness center. The latter was independently managed and was one of the nicest gyms Ive been to. Thats no longer the case. Due to a dispute with the hotel, the fitness center is gone. Its replaced by a typical hotel gym. The location is still its main selling point, downtown but not too loud or busy. The staff are great and so is the breakfast. Ive normally found the rooms to be outdated but this time I discovered that those on the 6th and 7th floor where I stayed have been upgraded and are nice and modern. </DOC> Comfortable full service hotel in great location for exploring Prague. Incredible service\u2014every member of the staff is top notch. Large room and comfortable bed. Executive lounge is roomy but food and drink options are limited and not the greatest quality. I enjoyed my stay here primarily because of the staff. The Marriott is a very good choice for the area and you will be well taken care of. </DOC> It is the perfect location to access shopping and restaurants. The room was nicely appointed and comfortable. The lobby has lovely area to relax or wait for someone. The staff was friendly and helpful. </DOC> I really enjoyed my stay at this Marriott due to a number of niceties. The location in the Old Town makes for great access to sites on the right bank with most things within walking distance. I was upgraded to an executive suite with a sitting room and enjoyed the friendly hospitality. My review lacks the fifth dot mainly due to service errors in the concierge lounge and a harder than normal bed. On more than one occasion, we had to request for food or juice that was empty during breakfast or for drinks in the fridge, to be refilled. These points are easily overlooked with a bit of patience and persistence. Hence my desire to come back to this Marriott next time I\u2019m in Prague.",

Rooms were nicely done, comfortable beds, nice amenities. Ate breakfasts in the hotel dining room and it was very good. Office staff were very accommodating in shipping some souvenirs home. General staff was very friendly and helpful. Room was clean and comfy. It is located within an easy walking distance form the major city squares and Christmas Markets. Would recommend this hotel and stay there again. </DOC> This hotel seemed supper busy with tourist groups, individuals and business/conference travelers. Our first encounter at the front desk was professional and friendly. In addition to checking in to our room, we also got a brief introduction to Prague on the map and some recommendations of places to visit and food to enjoy. The concierge desk folks were also helpful in getting us the concert tickets and making restaurant reservations. The location of the hotel is convenient, and just a short walk to the Old Town Square and to many restaurants. </DOC> We knew there were renovations going on, so we couldn\u2019t fault the hotel for that. On our first night, however, we were put in a communicating room and with the door being so thin and with a large space underneath, we could hear everything the family next door was saying (and screaming). We had a terrible night! The following day we asked to switch and that was made quite easy by the staff. Everything quite satisfactory: plenty of power outlets, clean room, comfortable bed. The breakfast, however, stood out as one the best breakfast buffets I\u2019ve had. Great selection, excellent quality. The location was quite good as well, as it is walking distance to pretty much anything you want to see while in downtown Prague. We particularly liked the small outdoor market a block away, which was a respite to the very high prices of the touristic area. </DOC> This was a typical, large Marriott in a good location. The room was clean and provided the usual amenities, including a coffee machine, iron, robe, slippers etc. The hotel was not exciting, the lobby was unremarkable, but the room provided a good place to overnight. The Bourbon Bar was attractive and a pleasant place to sit. The breakfast buffet offered the standard variety. </DOC> I have stayed here many times and this continues to be a great hotel . Just a few blocks from the old town square , great service at the desk , concierge and hospitality room . Rooms are top of the line as usual and everything at a descent price . This is a great choice to stay when in Prague . </DOC> The check in went smooth and a very friend staff to help. My requests we ask for were handled very well. Rita is outstanding on getting things done and in a timely way. Enjoyed the the executive floor and relaxing with our friends. Andrea at the front desk was so kind as to understand and listen to what we needed. My husband has mobility problems and she suguested we hire Mike and use a private driver for the city tour. It was booked though the hotel and he was a delight. Thumbs up to all of your staff. </DOC> As a platinum Bonvoy member we stay whenever we can. Love the perks, upgrades and lounge. This hotel didn\u2019t disappoint there and it is in a great location. Lounge has plenty for breakfast each day and the staff was fab. Out the hotel to the left and you are 10 mins from the square. Out to the right and a 5 minute walk to the Hop on Hop off bus which we like to do to get our bearings in a new hotel. Marriott needs to do better with consistency however. Coffee in our room not replenished after first day, nor sweeteners. Only one towel left one morning. I\u2019d stay here again but remember to take a look before turning in for bed as you\u2019ll want to call down before you need what they forgot! </DOC> We spent two nights during the Christmas period there and we were fully satisfied. We liked a lot Christmas decorations in the hotel lobby and plate of Christmas cookie in the room was very kind! Breakfast is usually on very high level in this hotel, so it was this time. Our mornig waitress Michaela was extremely lovely! In the building is garage, it\u00b4s really needed when you come to Prague by car. Price 600 CZK/night.",

The breakfast service is very good and it is located near to several good restaurants as well as near to the office I was visiting. 20 minutes from the airport in the late evening. </DOC> Stayed only for one night in the club room. The hotel is very nice and clean in general. Room on high floor has nice view of the city. Room was fairly big compared to European standards. Bathroom was nice. The one downside for the room was there was zero power outlet available bedsides and there was no can opener in my room. The health club was amazing with big nice pool and very good wood sauna. The lounge was very nice, quiet and tranquil. I love the bright color of the lounge and the orchids throughout. Food and drinks spread was decent and good quality. The staff was overall helpful and friendly. To sum up, the hotel offered a nice combination of location, facility and services with very very good gym and beautiful lounge. </DOC> Yet another trip to the Hilton in Warsaw and never disappointing. Staff are efficient, rooms are spacious and excellent and we had time to use the Exec lounge this time. We didn't eat in the Meza restaurant for once but went out, concierge booked us a hotel and set us off in a taxi. Breakfast was as good as usual, fresh juices, carrot juicing machine, etc etc. Have absolutely nothing to be negative about with this hotel. excellent. Thanks Hilton team. </DOC> Staff friendly and arranged for a breakfast box when they learned I was checking out early the next morning. They ask the right questions to know how to make your stay the most pleasant. Bedding was comfortable. Room was spacious and well furnished. Everything you expect from Hilton. </DOC> Stayed for two nights for work meetings. Hotel is very central and convenient to reach anywhere, rooms are nice spacious and clean. Service is somewhat lacking for the class of the hotel. Facilities provided in the hotel are great and breakfast was lovely. </DOC> Quite a large hotel with many floors and executive lounge. Large beautiful lobby with restaurant. Location is about 15 min walk to downtown area but walking distance to subway station to town. Quiet area. Room is beautiful and comfortable. Executive lounge food and service is excellent. Concierge is pretty good service. </DOC> I was here on business for one night. It was a quick stay, but very nice. The check-in process was very easy using the app and the selected room was available when I arrived. I recommend a room on a high floor. There are nice views. The staff sent me to a nice restaurant and guided me to a location that I wanted to see. It is not close to Old Town, but Old Town is a quick cab ride away. There are a number of places to eat near by and the train is close too. The room was very comfortable and easy to work in. The gym/fitness center is very nice. I wish I had more time to use it. The breakfast selection was very good with something for everyone. If I was in the area again, this hotel would be at the top of my list on places to stay. </DOC> Great business hotel. Well appointed rooms and nice views over the city from the higher floors. Friendly staff. Breakfast was tasty with a large selection of cold and warm dishes. Just no still water anywhere? It is within a 20min walking distance to the Old Town (easy straight down the road) where there are many restaurants and things to see. It is also within a 20min drive from the airport.",

Pool was busy since it was attached as a Holmes Place Health Club, spa was fine. It is 5 tram stops from the Central railway station. </DOC> I stayed there for a couple of nights. This is a 4 stars Hotel that is not nothing special in its interior details. It is a Hotel that is not bad at all but neither impresses you when you see it at first sight. The best thing is its location in the most elegant part of Warsaw. </DOC> Not long back from a two night stay. Easy journey from Airport in taxi. Very impressive lobby area. Fast lifts. Everything you could wish for in the room and exceptionally clean. Dinner in the restaurant first class. Breakfast was in our opinion perhaps the best ever experienced maybe only surpassed by the Cavalieri in Rome. What a great Hotel with some great people in a fantastic City. A credit to Warsaw and to Hilton. </DOC> Stayed for for one night on business and the experience was excellent. I normally stay in Hilton when travelling and this is one of the best. Reception staff were friendly with a good sense of humour. The room was really well appointed, comfortable and clean. Restaurant in the hotel was good with good food a reasonable service. I will definitely stay here again. </DOC> Nothing really wrong here. The rooms are spacious and the service is excellent. It is in the details where they not always meet the high Hilton standards expected. Bathroom was not clean, i found multiple long black hairs. Breakfast was ok choice wise, but one could not cope with the crowd. First day they served coffee/the at the table, 2nd day we all had to queue ourselves.at 1 machine (the others were broken). Croissants baskets were empty several time, same with the scrambled eggs... </DOC> Had a great week long stay at this Hilton. The staff is friendly and offers prompt and magnificent service. I was particularly impressed by Monika at the front desk who really made check in and check out a great experience. She is only a trainee, but she did a wonderful job and deserves recognition. The one major fix would be to offer a more varied selection of beverages in the executive lounge. They offer three varieties of Martini, but not one rum. Spa was great and the Holmes Place gym are top drawer. Also, the website lists \"local area transportation\" which creates the false impression they have a transport bus. This is not the case and refers to the taxi stand in the front. Stayed in Room 2413 which is a get room. </DOC> Just about everything you'd expect from a top quality Hilton so not a lot to add on that score. I didn't get to taste breakfast as I had to leave before the 6.30am start (so it could have been earlier). The location is a little odd, central yet not central. A 12 minute walk to the nearest train station, a good 35 minute walk to the Old Town and only on a fairly minor bus route (albeit reliable) this makes for a taxi-users hotel which is fine if you want your business to pay: I didn't. </DOC> Visited for a trade show being held at the hotel. Its a big hotel with great views from the higher floors. Its about half an hours walk from the old town or just take a cab from outside. If you are a tourist you might find its a little out of the way of what you want to see, but its not that far away and the area around the hotel is nice. Rooms are modern and very comfortable. Low noise, aircon is controllable and quiet, and the beds were really comfortable. It was just like home. Good selection at breakfast, and plenty of room. Staff were very friendly and helpful.",

        "docs": "I spent one night at the Palomar while attending a business meeting. I didn't get out much, but when I did I got to appreciate the great location, just a couple of blocks from Dupont Circle and all that it has to offer. My room was large, the bed was excellent, the wifi free and fast. And the bathroom was surprisingly large and quite nice. The free 5-6pm wine happy hour in the lobby was a nice touch. </DOC> From the moment we arrived, having just missed the nightly wine hour, and being given 2 passes for free wine from the hotel bar, until the minute we left when the front desk gentleman grabbed our luggage to put in the cab while insisting we take a few newspapers, we were treated like royalty. Conveniently located in Dupont Circle, mere steps from some great restaurants, bookstores and the Phillips Museum. So location is terrific. Free wine every night with some lovely appetizers, cannot argue with that. Had a minor problem with the television, an engineer was sent up immediately. Add a comfy bed, great shower head and quite nice bath products, and you have another Kimpton gem. </DOC> Very good location near DuPont Circle and Rock Creek Park. Excellent service at the front desk. Room was clean and efficient with enough lighting and outlets. Annoying decorative lighting for the art work for which there was NO obvious way to turn them off for sleeping. Good wifi but annoying to be charged for it after the fact even though I had prepaid what's supposed to be my full room charge and tax -=- then another $25-30 for \"hotel services\". Otherwise a fair price for the room. </DOC> Great location. Huge, clean comfortable rooms. Free wine and snacks at 5pm. Smiley staff. But...breakfast needs working on. Took ages to get served, and how can a 5* hotel in the middle of a city have run out of cereal? </DOC> This is a good, clean, quiet hotel. It is not in the centre of Washington but close to Metro and walking distance (just) from White House etc. Rooms were large and comfortable. The food was good although there was little choice of hot food at breakfast. Their complimentary wine service late afternoon was a nice touch. Our one complaint is that they ran out of \"proper\" (English Breakfast) tea. Although that was excusable, the fact they didn't replace it wasn't. </DOC> Location is ideal to explore DC. Rooms are spacious and comfy. free coffee and a wine hour run in the lobby which is a nice bonus. Recommend this hotel on a stay in Washington. Staff always friendly and helpful with any request. </DOC> Comfortable, functional and excellent location. Very friendly front of house and un-begrudging happy hour. Good local restaurant access and ashort walk to Metro. Rooms are straightforward and functional, but not impersonal. Only negative is that the showers don't drain well (colleague in another room had a similar \"flooding\" problem - essentially a poor design that does not have a sloping shower floor to drain. </DOC> Came here to celebrate my birthday, as well as DC Pride. This hotel was great! The location was in the heart of all the action, and well positioned to cafes, restaurants, bars, etc. The staff was so incredibly friendly and did everything in their power to make my stay an enjoyable one. The room was large, clean, and super comfortable. I also liked the wine in the evenings. I love this hotel; I have stayed many times in the past and would stay here many more times in the future.",

        "docs": "The Palomar is very close to DuPont Circle, easy walk to Georgetown and Foggy Bottom. Rooms are small but comfortable. The day I arrived, one elevator was out of service making for long waits but it was restored the next day. As another reviewer noted, rooms are a bit funky, rather than functional. The sliding bathroom door is big and heavy. The bed has sharp edges which my wife managed to bang against and received a nice black and blue mark. Lightning isn't great but I have to say it was very quiet and the bed was very comfortable. The TVs are huge and wifi access was good. Perhaps a refresh with the doors and bed frame are in order. Other than that, it's a great hotel. </DOC> The hotel was fine. It's away from the touristy sections of town. Lots of restaurants nearby. The room was clean, bed comfy, shower ok. Bathroom lighting a bit dim. It was a bit musty smelling and stuffy but then everything is humid in DC right now. Pool area was very small; it's an outside pool. Internet fee of $12.95 seemed pricey but usually I stay in Marriott properties were I get it for no charge. What stands out is the exceptional staff. All were extremely friendly and seemed genuinely interested in making the stay good. They have a wine reception every evening. Free coffee downstairs in the morning (but alas, no coffee maker in the room). </DOC> You'll love it. For these reasons... Huge rooms, great location, complimentary lobby drinks every day, a great restaurant, brilliant room service, huge beds, great toiletries, wonderful staff, dog-friendly, modern luxury... Go go go! </DOC> My dogs and I stayed at the Palomar the other evening and were so pleased to see that it has been updated since we last visited. The rooms are bright and spacious. Plenty of room for my two pups to romp around and play without being under foot. The bed was comfortable and the hotel is centrally located so it's a great launching off point if you're visiting the sites of the city. The one downside is that this hotel is very busy and the lobby area gets very crowded at peak check in and check out times as well as during the evening wine reception. Likewise the valets get behind at these times making it difficult for guest to arrive and depart via car. </DOC> This is a quirky boutique hotel just a couple of minutes' walk from DuPont Circle. It's a great location with downtown DC close by and a metro stop at DuPont Circle for places further away - really useful when the humidity is high! There's a free wine reception every evening and it was usually pretty busy - often with people bringing their dogs (it's a very pet friendly hotel). The bar/restaurant next door is pretty good (we just tried the bar menu) but there's plenty of other places nearby to eat. The pizzeria a block or two towards DuPont is particularly good. </DOC> Having recently stayed at the Kimpton Carlyle a few blocks away and not being particularly impressed, I was pleasantly surprised by the awesome experience I had at the Kimpton Palomar. My room was incredibly spacious (must have been upgraded) and beautifully appointed. One of the best designed hotel rooms I've ever stayed in. They really got all of the details right, including great amenities, comfortable beds, fast wifi, many outlets, good lighting etc. Housekeeping obviously did a good job as the room was super clean. The few interactions I had with the staff were all very friendly and efficient. The lobby did get a bit crowded at times as they seemed to have entire events just beside the check-in area, in addition to the daily happy hour, but my room was completely quiet. The location is perfect, too--convenient to DuPont, downtown, and the Red Line. </DOC> We came back to our room and found our safe open. The safe had our passports and cash and my sister was adamant that the safe had been locked when she left it. She then managed to lock the safe and open it using a simple code (available on YouTube). She reported it to the desk but they didn't seem to be very bothered. So watch your stuff in the hotel safe or carry it with you. We also got back to the hotel one evening at 5 pm and the room was still not cleaned. On a positive note, the happy hour in the foyer was excellent. The red wine was of a good quality and served with popcorn and the restaurant breakfast was excellent. But we didn't get over the shock of nearly losing all our valuables. </DOC> It helps when you get in late from travelling to be offered a room upgrade for free, and that was much appreciated as we lucked out with a king bed and a jacuzzi bath. Next thing Bruce tells us is that 5-6pm each night is FREE WINE for guests. You heard me right. So this is a Kimpton Hotel, part of IHG, and we were booked by Trailfinders. Good on them, but we will be back to this chain without doubt. Location close by but not on DuPont Circle is great. Buzzing community, plenty of local eating options. If you are travelling into Union Station as we did, forget the taxi, it's 5 stops direct on the Red Line. This one's a keeper",

        "docs": "A lovely hotel right next to Dupont Circle. My room was large, king bed very comfortable, clean bathroom, basic gym on the second floor. Staff super friendly, Starbucks right next door (also free coffee in lobby in morning.) </DOC> I arrived here in the morning but my room has been reserved from the day before so it was ready. It must be one of the best hotel rooms I slept in. Too bad I was there for only one night. The room was big, with a huge bed, a Jacuzzi and a yoga mat. Restaurant staff were all great including the supervisor. My best front desk staff was Ella. I had breakfast and dinner in the restaurant. There is good walking streets around. I enjoyed it. </DOC> This was really a perfect choice for a mother/daughter college tour trip. We booked a reduced rate upgrade to a suite, which was ideal -- plenty of room and thoughtful touches (who doesn't love hot chocolate with peppermint stick in the lobby each day, and the towels were thick and plentiful). The AAA rate was very fair, the location is perfect, just a hop/skip from Dupont Circle with lots of places to eat nearby, and we had a quiet room (facing a parking lot, but I prefer that to street noise). We ate at the restaurant twice, which has brick oven pizza bar and very nice food. Everyone was helpful and friendly -- it was great. </DOC> I had a short but very pleasant stay at this hotel on a recent business trip. Front desk staff (Ricky and Chance) were outstanding and really wanted to ensure that all was right with my stay. My guest room was extremely comfortable and everything was in order. I did not use the outlets this time but will when I return. Great job gang, thank you. </DOC> So very disappointed in this hotel.... front desk manager rude, made a big deal about being upgraded to a city view but the room had a view of the parking lot - manager said none of the rooms have views. Happy hour is madness in the tiny lobby. Very little personality or style to be found. </DOC> We have stayed here 3 times this year alone. Each time service seems to slip a little. This last time the service was a little sloppy -- the hallways definitely needed to be vacuumed, the mini bars didn't have price lists, the staff is helpful, location is great, they have wine at 5 ad coffee in the morning. Just need to be a little more aware of the little things. </DOC> We have stayed at lots of Palomar Hotels, including Los Angeles (twice) and Philadelphia. In Washington, we had a car and a pet, which limited our choices to apartment type hotels such as the Carlyle Suites. Unfortunately, the Carlyle website was not working when I went to make a reservation, so we stayed for three days at the Palomar. The people are great and the hotel room was big enough, but regrettably there was no kitchen, as in the Carlyle, and the heating did not work. We had three men to repair it, once when it was too cold, once when it was too hot, and again when it was cold. This should not happen at a good property. The location is nice, and we found a pho restaurant down the block that was good, and the local scene is quite nice. </DOC> Stayed couple of nights on business. Good location Dupont Circle/Georgetown. Safe area. Now part of IHG, retains boutique independent feel. All areas bright and breezy, rooms of a very good size, all decor and furnishings crisp. Winetime at 5 in the lobby is a nice touch. All round decent hotel for business or pleasure when in DC.",

        "docs": "Difficult to fault this place at all. The service is really 5 star with the staff almost wrestling with you for your luggage. The rooms are big, well equipped and have all amenities apart from a fridge. WiFi is excellent in the front lobby but you have to pay in your room. I was surprised at that. The buffet food was top quality, fresh and healthy with some very tempting arabic sweets! </DOC> Been travelling all over the world and this is biggest and luxurious transit hotel that we ever stayed in. Very fast checked in at 2 am and the room's window is facing the interior of the building. The only negative point would be the room smelled like smoke, maybe it is a smoking room and we were too tired to ask for another room. </DOC> I\u2019ve stayed at the Oryx Rotana 13 times over the last 5 years. I\u2019ve started to notice that the rooms are now looking tired and old. As the norm they are dark, very dark even with the lights on - the rooms don\u2019t have sufficient lighting. The bathroom had moldy and chipped tiles. The staff at the hotel are always friendly and offer awesome customer service. The common areas of the hotel are worthy of the 5 star rating and the choice of restaurants is fantastic. The main buffet restaurant has themed buffets most nights and food is amazing. Also tired the Chinese restaurant and had some delicious duck! All in all I think the rooms are overdue for a renovation. If you\u2019re paying for a room there is better value in Doha. If it\u2019s free from Qatar Airways I guess you can\u2019t complain \ud83d\ude02 </DOC> Spent less than 12 hours in the hotel as I was transiting in Doha on my way to the Far East. Qatar Airlines provided a free hotel stay as my transit time was a long one. Check in was quick, as was check out a few hours later. The room I was given was a non-smoking room, thank God. The bed was nothing to write home about, but the water pressure in the shower was amazing. The tiled floor in the shower area was very slippery, however. They ought to do something about it as someone could have a nasty fall in there. All in all, adequate for passing thru. </DOC> I went there actually during daytime to have something to sleep between two nightflights. The hotel was nice and the staff professional. Everything worked fine. However, I deduct one star because the hotel was aware that I needed a room for daytime rest and they gave me one in an area with ongoing reconstruction. Other than that, everything was fine. </DOC> No issues other thank I did not like the smoke in the lobby areas which spread across the lifts. I meet people in the lobby and this smoke was an issue for me. Otherwise a good property , nice rooms, well appointed, shower good. </DOC> Very good hotel near the airport. Good size rooms and a very good breakfast. Ideal for a transit or short stop over if passing through Doha. . Free shuttle to airport is an added bonus.I would certainly return on a future occasion </DOC> Excellent hotel 10mins drive from airport with very comfortable rooms and great service. Looks like the hotel had some good bars too but sadly we were only there a few hours. Would recommend. We also stayed in the main city which was double the distance.",

        "docs": "Well, the hotel was provided for free as a stopover on our way to Germany by Qatar Airways and we were more then pleased by the way the airline and the hotel have treated us. Beautiful design, great rooms (we had two), very attentive staff and cozy restaurants where we could chose from a variety of local and international dishes and wine. We could have stayed much longer. A remark: I give the 5 stars not because it was free but because it was great. </DOC> I just love this hotel, it is all orchestrated to make you feel home without any hassle. Will come back many more times. I always stop by the Jazz Bar and never miss at least one dinner in the themed nights. I would like to make a special thanks to Jennifer Lass Pasaquian m the reservation manager, in all my previous stays in world known brands, I have never been so much respected as a client when I faced a problem that has nothing to do with the hotel, but an issue regarding visa procedures do Doha. She was so professional and I could not miss the opportunity to thank her a million times. </DOC> The hotel stay as in room and comfort and service were excellent. The staff was very accommodating after the airline incorrectly cancelled my booking. However, be aware... for two coffees and a slice of cake, we paid $45. That is ridiculous hence value for money, I had to downgrade it to 4 out of 5. </DOC> We stayed here for a night for free under the Qatar Airways \"free-hotel-with-long-stopovers\" programme. The beauty of this programme is that the hotel doesn't apply its normal check-out time: we checked-in at midnight with a flight leaving at 8pm the next day and were automatically given a check-out time of 6pm, with a free shuttle bus back to the hotel. Brilliant! The hotel, incidentally, is very attractive inside and the room was very comfortable. The bathroom was large (an almost ridiculously big shower - enough room to sit down on the shower-bench provided!) and the breakfast was comprehensive. </DOC> This is a spectacular hotel - the airport pick ups are seamless, the rooms large, clean and quiet, and the restaurants are quite good, with a reasonable selection of wines by the glass. The staff are all very friendly and attentive. A perfect place to transit - my only suggestion would be to perhaps get somewhere closer in if you want to be able to just walk out and wander around the old part of town. </DOC> Due to unforseen flight schedule changes, we were offered tranfer stopover night at Oryx Rotana on both out and inbound flight connections. Easy booking process by the airline. Transfer fo and to airport by hotel bus. Smooth check-in and got meal vouchers to be consumed during the stay. Nice clean modern rooms. View to the city construction sites. Excellent buffet breakfast. Many restaurant options for the dinner. Great service for recommending sights to be seen and fixing taxis. </DOC> Had a nites stay in this internal impressive hotel...the super modern construction is astonishing...the architect must be very imaginative.. There are 4 lifts with views of the 1st floor restaurant so there's no time wasted getting down or up. The building seemed to be held by metal pipes ...after all belongs to Qatar airways. The breakfast was so varied and a great set up...one could not get thr to taste even a quart... The rooms super comfortable and large and equipped with good supplies except tooth brush n paste...could get on demand though.. Highly recommended... </DOC> Only about 10min from airport. Free shuttle service every hour. Friendly staff, very comfortable , and quiet, rooms and adequate gym for a quick workout. Didn't try the food but a couple of options available.

Fabulous ambiance and nice food. There is a lot of it so do not expect just a snack. Vegetarians are catered for. Superb service that makes the whole experience rather special. Open area which can have disadvantages when those who are illiterate fail to read signs asking photos are not taken(or maybe they are merely ignorant of UAE law). On the whole, well worth the cost for the relaxation. Parking under the hotel. </DOC> My husband and I visited the Emirates palace hotel to specifically indulge in the cappuccino dusted with gold flakes - just one of those typically extravagant things unique to the UAE! We also enjoyed a chocolate fondant in these opulent surroundings. The palace hotel is vast and sumptuous in its luxury - it is well worth a visit just to explore the glorious building and grounds. </DOC> Can't comment on the rooms, since we didn't sleep here. We did a long walk-through, saw the huge gorgeous Christmas tree, and the Gold vending machine. We shared one slice of succulent chocolate cake at the pastry shop off the lobby (US$15). Good people watching. A big event for top level Emiratees was about to occur on the lawn, when we left. Non-stop helicopters dropping off folks. The outside property is beautiful, should have been a golf course. An incredibly impressive property on the surface. Not quite ready to take a room here at the current prices. </DOC> As soon as one step inside this hotel, one will experience this grandness that is just not seen anywhere else. We had lunch in the lobby after our visit at Grand Mosque. The lunch was simply lovely and we enjoyed the ambience around with a pianist. We like the service immensely. A visit to Abu Dhabi is not complete without a visit here </DOC> Emirates Palace, one of the most luxurious hotels in the world. It consists of two wings, east wing and west wing. each wing have it's own swimming pool for adults and kids You may chose one of 3 views: - city view. - garden view. - sea view (which is the most expensive) Tip: the west wing swimming pool is larger and have water slides, where the east wing pool is quieter. Tip2: Reception and restaurants near The east wing Disadvantage: no coffee maker machine, or even water boiler in the room. </DOC> Absolutely beautiful! Wonderful decor, amazing tea and super staff. Couldn't do enough for you. They cater for vegetarians too. The tea was very filling, despite not looking much initially. You are not rushed at all. I recommend this to anyone as a real treat. However, I would warn anyone about the air conditioning, take a wrap or a cardigan/jumper, it's freezing! </DOC> Prior to staying at this fantastic hotel again, I replied to my reservation confirmation asking that my reply be forwarded to their concierge team. I asked them to liaise with the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque as I wanted to do a photo shoot there at dawn which on the day that I wanted to do that I couldnt. Their team then gave me an outline of an alternative location to take photos from and even provided an example of what i would see with a logistics plan of getting from the hotel to the location and back. On top of this they provide me with a plan \"B\" so that the original idea I had they could help organise it for sunset instead. The level of service offered is sensational.",

Bedrooms are Ok,nice little terrace. Different restaurants that offer different cuisines. Pricey but what do you expect staying at the Palace. The food at the Emirati Restaurant was very good. Dined at the Italian and the food was also good! The hotel has 2 swimming pool's, one with a lazy river more ideal for families with kids and the other pool more quiet and relaxing with a pool bar and lounges in the pool. The beach was okay, the non-motorized watersports activities we're free of charge. If your looking for fine dining, a OTT luxurious stay then this hotel would be good for you. Would only come back if other options were not available, </DOC> From the minute one arrives you just know that this is a very special hotel venue, the service sets the standard for others to achieve, the decor is both unique and spotless the amenities and staff faultless the service outstanding, you can see I am running out of superlatives to describe this venue. Check out the restaurants they are also superb sit and enjoy a coffee you will not be disappointed </DOC> Excellent stay in the Emirates Place over the Christmas. Staff were superb. Rooms were excellent. The food was quality all the way. Beach and facilities just brilliant. You are paying top dollar though. 4 hot chocolates was AED163 (\u20ac38), but sure look who wants hot chocolate in the desert :-). Would definitely return. </DOC> It is a five star hotel but I give it 8. The entrance gate is more like a palace. If you don\u2019t have car, it hardly gets in here. There are many guests and tourists visiting this place but not stay. However, the service is still excellent. There are plenty of sofas to just sit there. Lobby toilet is clean all the time. I recommend to have afternoon tea at the lobby. You can see the Etihad building on the Opposite side of the hotel. It is the buildings that scened in the fast and furious7; in the car jump scene. </DOC> It\u2019s most luxury hotel in Abu Dhabi, nearby the royal palace, you can enjoy the delicious seafood buffet in restaurant, with private seaside views. </DOC> What a brilliant Hotel, the drive up to the entrance is stunning. Once inside even more so. A lovely welcome on our afternoon tea. Our host was Fitriana and she really made us feel very special, she was very attentive and nothing was too much trouble. The afternoon tea was fantastic with a great selection of unusual twists on the sandwiches, scones and pastries, the selection of tea's were also very good and the champagne as well. Fitriana spent time getting to know us and brought a lovely gesture for my birthday. But the afternoon went to quickly. We have had many afternoon tea's around the world and this is at the top. This is a must will return if back in Abu Dhabi again and maybe stay next time. </DOC> It's a bird - it's a plane, it's a palace, no wait it's a hotel !! When the Royal family is in town they stay here and the hotel is closed to guests. When they are not in town, they open some of the guest rooms to visitors like you. Yes, you get to stay in a real palace and that is a gift to you the visitor because they are not renting you a room for the money. We felt very special staying here. The place is only 20 years old but the finish makes it feel hundreds of years old. The permanence and magnitude and scale of this place left us slack-jawed (and we have truly seen it all) Try to come between December and April and avoid the first 2 weeks of January because the shopping holiday during that period makes everything far too busy. </DOC> A huge hotel with fabulous decor. Our suite faces the beach. The only problem was that workmen were breaking down the wedding stages etc from the day before. They worked until well after dark and the noise was very annoying. In a suite at this price point there should have been quiet. Don\u2019t accept suite 3219! We had high tea which was great, served by Marshall, a charming young man.

Huge grounds, two large pools , two large gyms and beautiful public areas. Speaking of public areas, the only slight downside personally was the \"coach tours\" who turn up for afternoon tea. Not quite sure having groups with their cameras and bumbags adds to the reputation of the hotel. Just my opinion though. </DOC> luxury...this is oppulent luxury....huge hotel...the perimeter of one level is 1.6 km...you can find in the huge lobby even an vendor machine who sell gold. Awesome hotel! </DOC> This hotel is a must-see to any city visitor and a very nice place to stay as well. We had a beautiful suite supplied with its own butler. The room was quite large and well-appointed; there are multiple high quality restaurants to choose from, as well as high end shopping. Service throughout our stay was top notch. The layout reminded us somewhat of a large Vegas property without the casino- very large and full of gold. Definitely recommend if you are staying in Abu Dhabi. </DOC> We travelled with a 3 year old and this hotel really is amazing! Staff were great and so helpful and they could not of been nicer to our son. Food was spot on. With a great selection including sushi and custom made pasta and risotto of your choice. Hotel and rooms was so clean!They Even had cinema films on the tv at no extra cost. Loads of English channels too. Including sport ;-) Both big pools (1 at the east wing 1 at the west wing) were fantastic, with the pool bars and lazy river and slides. The beach was brilliant with so many water sports and things to do. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and would go back at a heart beat </DOC> I recently had brunch here and was blown away by the choice. Usually I will spent maybe 90 min max brunching, but we ended up staying here for 4 hours. The environment was so relaxing, eating outside between the pools in the shade. For me the best part was the sushi bar. All you can eat fresh sushi and sashimi - delicious! We rounded off the meal with a walk through the property which was stunning. </DOC> I had made an online reservation for afternoon tea at Le Caf\u00e9 in The Emirates Palace Hotel which is based on the ground floor. The hotel is amazing and this is the best way to enjoy it without having to spend a fortune. I was slightly disappointed in the quality of the food, I have certainly had better, but it's a nice way to spend a couple of hours in this lovely hotel. </DOC> The walk through the grounds is lovely. The place itself is beautiful, only spoilt by the number of people taking selfies. The cafe was a nice experience, the Camelcino was gorgeous made with camel milk.",

The room was not huge but well planned and comfortable in pale wood, the harbour view rooms are just that, with a great view out to Kowloon. However, there is massive development of the waterfront going on and being on the harbour side means you can see, and hear, construction work from about 7am. The bathroom was a good size although rather old fashioned in marble and gold, clean and well stocked with soft towels and pleasant toiletries. The hotel restaurants that I tried were all very good though at hotel prices of course. Service throughout the hotel was impeccable and I look forward to staying here again. </DOC> An immaculate hotel that really lives up to its 5star rating.

A little bit of an up sell at checkin was done politely and declined as I couldn\u2019t figure out what was being offered. ( they offered harbour view which was what I already had booked) . Only moments after stepping in the room housekeeping arrived to check all was ok. Nice touch. At the gym the host even provided towel,water and wiped done the machine I choose . Top notch. Room was huge , spotlessly clean and an amazing view of the harbour. Plenty of bottled water and some fresh fruit as well. Topped off an amazing stay ( albeit a quick one ) </DOC> OK, so I write essentially the same review every six months. That should tell you something. From airport pick up to in room check in to the spotless and comfortable room to the seamless transportation arrangements to fully equipped gym (the attendant wipes down the treadmill belt after use! really!) to the comforting sauna to the 50 meter pool to the cozy and welcoming Champagne lounge... it's just all good. It's where I stay in Hong Kong. </DOC> I arrived in the afternoon. the valet took my bag and brought me into the reception desk. Check in was easy and I was in my room quickly. The valet brought the bags right up. The room was fairly large for Hong Kong with a sitting area and desk as well as bed. The bathroom is separated by a controlable screen and had a bath and separate shower and toilet areas. The shower was excellent with good water pressure to both the rainshower and handheld nozzles. The amenities re June Jacobs which has been the standard at Hyatt for a while. The bed was comfortable. The staff was friendly and helpful, especially with arranging taxis. I would recommend this hotel if you want to be on the island side of Hong Kong. </DOC> I really enjoyed my stay. My room was wonderful. Service in all places was nearly perfect, and some of special events banqueting staff and a few other general staff really went the extra mile.The grand club amenities are over the top, and if you're staying on the club level, you'd never need to leave the hotel for a meal, since breakfast, high tea, happy hour, and all-day beer, wine, and soft drinks are available. My only complaints are the layout of the grand cafe breakfast buffet and seating is awkward, the business center is currently under renovation, and the location, while amazing if you're attending something at the convention center, is inconvenient for walking to other parts of the city, partially due to what sounds like a major infrastructure project surrounding the property. </DOC> Stayed here for business while in Hong Kong. The hotel was very nice and is definitely 5 star. Bathroom very much like the Ritz with separate tub and shower. All Marble. Beds were comfortable. The hotel is a little off the beaten path on the harbor, so you will need to walk 2-3 blocks or take a cab to get to other restaurants and tourist attractions. There was a lot of construction outside my room, but I didn't hear anything. My room had a lovely view. </DOC> Take rooms at higher levels. Good hotel. Good service quality. Like all Hyatt hotels, it is Hyatt standard quality. No surprises. The restaurants are okay, but would have liked if the options were more. Due to lack of options often we had to have dinner outside. </DOC> A luxurious hotel - the foyer with its waterfall is beautiful!. The rooms are large with an excellent shower ( huge) and bath. The toiletries were lovely and all the extra bits were useful. They also had a list of extra toiletries that were available if you had forgotten your own. A Nespresso coffee machine was excellent for that early morning cup! Unfortunately my view of the harbour consisted of a HUGE building site. The hotel is also undergoing renovations which at times was extremely noisy ( although we were pre warned of this). The room also had a mobile phone for personal use it was great with the preloaded information on sightseeing and very useful with the maps.The buffet breakfast is amazing plenty of choices. But be warned to eat in is expensive! The staff were amazing so very helpful.",

        "docs": "I stayed in the hotel for business and it is truly a luxury hotel. The service is outstanding and the hotel is high-end. Everything from the very spacious room to the entrance hall. It is right at the water and the view is fantastic. If anything I wish they would have a simpler \"true\" bar as the only thing I found was a restaurant downstairs with a bar, a champagne room and one at the pool, which however was for smokers. Consider an old school bar for a beer and you are golden </DOC> Very good hotel near the Convention Center. It is best for businessmen for its location. Nice gym included. Breakfast is good with plenty of different choises. There is also pool area for relaxation and an otside bar for drinks. I feel it is a bit expensive but if you can get a good price it is worth visiting. </DOC> Grand entrance and good location on the waterfront by the convention centre and east walk to metro. Given upgrade to suite on 11th floor with excellent facilities from hot tub to steam room . Very comfortable and great service from staff . Grand cafe excellent breakfast Buffett . Only drawback was the noise from building site next door which went from early to late . So avoid if you like quiet . </DOC> From the moment I arrived at the Arrivals Hall of the Hong Kong International Airport where I asked the hotel to send a car to pick me up, I was taken care of. When I arrived in the driveway of the Grand Hyatt, a young man opened the car door, knew who I was and escorted me directly to my room, skipping the check in process in the lobby entirely. I am in a harborview king bed room on the 18th floor. its just right for my one night stay. Clean, updated, and gorgeous views out the floor to ceiling window. Thank you Grand Hyatt. </DOC> Probably my fourth or fifth stay at the Grand Hyatt. Perfect; again... First class car service from the airport; met outside my car by an associate the CHECKED ME INTO MY ROOM IN MY ROOM. Clean, well appointed rooms, with plenty of space for late nigh calls to the US and getting work done. Daily room service is excellent, just as clean day two as day one. Excellent, excellent gym, sauna and 50 meter pool with attentive staff. Top notch breakfast buffet (my favorite in Asia) with excellent service. Comfortable Champaign Bar that features nice jazz music and state of the art mixology. The steak restaurant, on premise, has a variety of steaks from different locations and quality. I had the grass-fed Australian that was HUGE and of perfect texture, preparation and quality. No need to stay anywhere else. See you in six months!!! </DOC> Stayed here for 2 nights in October 2016, in one of the \"Plateau\" rooms. Our room was very nice, large and comfortable, and had a huge walk-in type bath tub. Staff couldn't have been nicer, they were just a tad late in delivering our luggage after check-in and promptly made up for it by offering us a bottle of wine - very nice gesture indeed. We were stuck at the hotel of a day because of a storm warning, but the comfort of the room and the remaining facilities made siiting it out as pleasant as it could have been. The location is good, not too far away from the subway and there is a free shuttle (not run by the hotel) from Hong Kong Station (which is where the trains from the airport arrive). </DOC> Loved the quality of the room, bed linens, location. Gym is adequate (lacks steam room but there is a sauna). Breakfast restaurant on the ground floor is amazing - great selection of food options from across the world. </DOC> I think the rooms have recently been renovated as everything feels quite new and clean. The rooms are very spacious and the beds are very comfortable. I especially like the range of amenities supplied in the room - cosmetic pads, toothbrushes, razors etc. Perfect for the business traveller. The only issue I have is that I had issues getting a table in the Grand Cafe even though it was empty they told me it was full. I pushed and they somehow 'found' a table for me. They should accommodate guests and not force us out of the hotel. I will likely go back next year.",

        "docs": "So, this was not a cheap night in a hotel, but boy was it impressive. We landed in HK overnight from EU and to ease things had ordered limo to collect us ($100+). Also, as we had travelled all night we pre-asked hotel for early check-in (at 10am so we could sleep for a few hours). The service was excellent. A guy met us and walked us to a large black Merc, that had us at the hotel in 30 mins; a woman met us from the car and walked us directly to our room (no reception crap), she took our passport and CC info in the room and then everyone disappeared so we could sleep. IMPRESSIVE. We had booked a room with a view and it definitely had one, of the whole of HK bay; unbelieviable. All in all a real experience. Excellent stuff. </DOC> An excellent choice in HK. As a Hyatt globalist being able to enjoy the lounge for breakfast and cocktails certainly adds to the appeal and value. This is how you would expect a 'big city high end' hotel to operate. Everything in our King Harbor Suite was perfect, from the electronic blinds to the AC to the Wifi to the TV. My only criticism is mini bar and room service prices, but these are market driven and inline with other hotels of this quality in HK. Providing I can get a 'reasonable' rate, I would definitely return here. </DOC> We booked last minute, but were not disappointed. Upon arrival we were upgraded and showed to our japanese style room, those are located same level as the spa. We had also a balcony, which was quite nice. The staff was nice and quite professional. Location was also good. We stayed close to Times Square and walking distance to the ferry for Kowloon. The breakfast and dinner buffet were really fantastic. The lobby is a bit not cozy, but you have a nice lounge bar on the second floor. The spa was a bit less then we expected(just one small hot sauna) for the steam baths you had to pay.... ? But the floor and the area looked really nice. And had everything one needed. </DOC> I stayed at the Grand Hyatt Hong Kong for one night before heading to Macau. Contrary to what photos of the hotel show, this property looks fairly tired in person. For the $500/night the hotel charges, there are definitely better, newer options. The hotel is located in Wanchai but not terribly close to some of the restaurants and nice coffee shops I enjoy checking out in the area. Service was good but I would probably stay elsewhere next time I am in town. </DOC> This hotel exceeded all expectations, very welcoming, efficient and friendly staff. Super clean, great pool area with kids playground. Food and service in the executive lounge was superb with probably one of the best views in Hong Kong. The Chinese restaurant was also very good. Room was of very good size with large bathroom with shower and bath, again the view from our room was breathtaking. Will def stay again if we return to Hong Kong. </DOC> From arrival via hotel car to check in and walked to my beautiful corner suite, this is truly a 5 star hotel. I was fortunate to be on the club floor. I did not use the Club Lounge this time, but had a great in room breakfast. Beautiful views of Victoria Harbor. Great guest experience. Thank you Grand Hyatt! </DOC> The hotel has an unbeatable location next to the Convention centre. King room on the 27th floor was spacious, spotless and with a great, wide view. Everything nicely appointed, however bathroom products were a little disappointing for this price range. The bed was on the firmer side for my liking but I slept well. Did not sample breakfast. Room service was expensive but excellent quality. Plentiful supply of free water. The staff member at check-in showed little interest in me or my needs and did nothing to make me feel welcome, however on check out the guy was charming and went out of his way to help me make arrangements for my departure. </DOC> At Grand Hyatt Hong Kong everything is as you would expect it to be. Perfect and a little bit boring. Black limousines outside, oversized entr\u00e9 and expensive furnishing. Getting a view of the harbor can be complicated unless explicitly stated in your reservation. The huge HK Exhibition Centre obscures much of the view. Location is Wan Chai which means right between Causeway Bay (Times Sq) and Central (the cool places on the island). Smallish but stylish luxury rooms with no amenities missing, fast and somewhat reliable WiFi, very good breakfast from 6:30 and a decent (but very cold) gym. Outdoor pool in private garden on 11th floor. Bonus: in most rooms (?) there is a Handy. A smartphone that you can use for free internet connectivity all over HK. Works as a phone or a wifi hotspot.",

        "docs": "The service here is among the very best in Hong Kong, most of the time beating Peninsula and Ritz-Carlton, especially the front desk and the grand club. Impeccable from the checkin to the dining experience. The suite has a gorgeous outlook over the Victoria harbour. Thanks to Max Wang, Yorky, Oliana, Jonathan who were most and most helpful during our stay here, caring to each of our demanding needs. We used to stay in Ritz, Peninsula, Renaissance, but this stay should have us put Grand Hyatt on the must visit list. As Globalist, we don\u2019t usually dine in the grand club during the happy hour, but we\u2019ve heard this one is superb. The outcome was even beyond expectations: very decent, could carry out the luxury standard, satisfying. Definitely recommend this property. </DOC> Having just spent 4 nights at this lovely hotel. The room whilst a little dated was very clean and maintained well with a lovely view of the harbour. The works at the street below did not effect our stay and noise was minimal. The check in staff very efficient and polite at all times. The club lounge was superb one of if not the best we have found under the Hyatt brand. Scott the manager in the lounge was so very friendly and helpful suggesting day trips sightseeing ideas etc. and nothing was too much effort. Would definitely stay at this hotel again should we be travelling through Hong Kong. </DOC> Longtime Hyatt fan, particular at the higher end properties, and this may have been my best stay yet. Attentive, proactive, and caring staff. The Grand Cafe offers a great value and spectacular view. Proximity to the convention center can't be beat. </DOC> Usually stay at Mandarin Oriental but this time I decided to stay here instead - it was a very nice hotel. Big - yes, but great swimming pool and gym. Rooms are spacious, new and functional, views are stunning, restaurant/bar is great too. And it's a fraction of the cost of the Mandarin... I'd be back in a heartbeat. </DOC> I've reviewed this hotel a couple of times before but service on a recent stay was so impressive I felt compelled to write another review. As always, the quality of the refurbished club rooms was excellent. The club is outstanding and I'm always so impressed that the unflappable Scott remembers us each visit despite a gap of some months. During our stay, we had a minor but rather annoying maintenance issue that took some time for the hotel to fix. Tim, from FOH management, could not have been more responsive or customer focussed in dealing with this issue and managed to turn a negative experience into a very positive one. I look forward to my return in the not too distant future. </DOC> Having stayed here a number of times before I decided this time to upgrade to the club level. Well firstly, what a great experience from the check in on level 30 through to the service it was all professional while being personable. The club is fantastic, great service, the biggest danger is trying to walk away from the selection of drinks and food. Will be back </DOC> We stayed here for an Ophthalmology Convention at the Hongkong Convention & Exhibition Centre which is just a few steps away and never was I so in love with a Hotel. Grand Hyatt has got to be on the top of my list for any hotel worldwide. From a smooth check- in by a polite & friendly staff at the lobby \"Felan\", to a jaw- dropping Room with the best harbour- view!bEverything was just perfect- from the welcome fruit, the best pillows & bed, toilet & bath amenities, coffee, tea & mini- bar, additional bottles of water at night. Service was really excellent! Never been this in love, Grand Hyatt!! \u2764\ufe0f </DOC> Stayed here for one night during early December. Check-in was a breeze and the staff noted my WOH status well. The room is comfortable with amenities well stocked. Overall had a good night of rest. Tried the gym in the morning and some improvement in the hardware equipment may be overdue in my opinion. The breakfast at the cafe was excellent as usual with a wide spread of western and Asian food. Easy access to subway-MTR (maybe a brisk 15 minute walk). Only comment is that there is a lot of construction work in the area and it may create a bit of noise during the day, but if you are out during the day, not an issue. A solid 4/5.",

        "docs": "The Four Points sheraton is located right on the Singapore river at the upper end of Robertson Quay. There is a foot bridge that you can walk across to the many restaurants there. The rooms are decent but not very big. Breakfast is standard buffet. It is located on Havelock road so there are normally a lot of traffic and also a lot of taxi. I would go back again </DOC> We spent 2 nights here after long flight. In a deluxe room. Comfortable, good food with riverside bar. Pleasant riverside and road walks about. Recommended to spoil yourself. Hop on hop off bus outside the door. </DOC> Stayed here for 3 nights and found ourselves really really satisfied! We enjoyed every moment staying here. Room was good, spacious enough with complimentary drinking bottles, soft and comfortable bed and pillows, welcoming fruit plate, a smartphone to bring out. Staff was friendly and helpful while location was great, not far from Clarke Quay MRT, less than 1 minute to bus stop. Highly recommended! </DOC> Outstanding meals... Both the buffet and the menu items are outstanding. We enjoyed both the dinner and breakfast buffets, and the quality was first class. The entire property and a staff that goes the extra mile. Thanks to Chefs Young Wan and Seng, and the service staff were over the top! </DOC> This is a good hotel with good amenities. The only downside of this hotel is its location. Though Singapore itself is a small place, the location of this hotel from downtown and from the airport makes it harder to access. The other aspect of this hotel that can improve is the breakfast it provides for vegetarian which is very limited. Can have a couple of dishes for vegetarians only. Otherwise, the service, ambience and rooms are comfortable. </DOC> This hotel is located on the river which provides multiple dining and pub options in walking distance. A 4 minute Uber to Clarke quay or just walk the 1.5km The beds are very comfortable and the sheets pillow and comforter are cool to the touch Plenty of electrical outlets and your US plug will plug right in Shower was comfortable with good pressure They have a nice buffet breakfast and Sunday brunch For Starwood membership sure you get your discounts on meals </DOC> We had a river view room on a high floor. Great view of the river, riverwalk, and city skyline. Swimmable outdoor pool with plenty of lounge chairs - both in the sun and in the shade. Good variety of exercise equipment. Direct access to the riverwalk. Bus stop right outside the front door. Shopping mall within 15 minute walk. Convenient location for getting to all the city sights and attractions. Rooms are spacious. Walk-in shower. Desk w ergonomic chair, hot water pot to make tea or coffee, French press coffee maker, mini fridge. 4 restaurants on site. Dozens more along the riverwalk. Concierge to help with daily planning. Best of all - very friendly and helpful staff! </DOC> I stay here for a week and surprised with the best service. Location fantastic and really next to river. Every one very professional and very friendly. My sincere thanks to Mohan, Billy,Jenny,Yen,Amin, Lulu, Zhen, Suzanna and everybody working at Four point",

        "docs": "A lovely welcome at the hotel on arrival and a speedy check in. We were given a lovely room overlooking the river on the 7th floor. It was very comfortable and the hallways were very clean and fresh and always very quiet. There was a lovely swimming pool on the 5th floor with lovely loungers and big fluffy towels, a washing machine and dryer were also available. We had breakfast every day which offered a variety of different foods for most tastes. We also had a lunch one afternoon which again was very nice and the staff so very caring and friendly. A lovely hotel which was placed very conveniently eat to all restaurants on the way of Clark\u2019s Quay and all the shops and river cruises. Very tranquil and welcoming hotel. </DOC> Just returned from a 3 day stay and we were most impressed. The staff were fantastic and most helpful with any questions regards eating out and getting around. Top marks to the lady receptionist. The bar does have its own beer at a very good price especially at happy hour 50 percent off. Nice and quite and on the main bus route, free shuttle bus to Orchard road. </DOC> In terms of location, this hotel is pretty neat. Situated right next to the river, so breakfast at the outdoor tables is a good idea. Its also a 20 mins walk to Clark Quay (along the river with many restaurants along the way). A 15 mins ride on a taxi would also get you to a shopping mall call Vivo City. Staff very friendly and helpful. Check in was quick and the room was great, the rooms are very new, so I am assuming they have just renovated. Overall an excellent stay so I would recommend this Hotel, specially if you are bored of the usual orchard road Hotels. </DOC> Close enough to the attractions for walking but far enough out of the centre for a bit of tranquility by the riverside. We stayed for two nights as a stopover heading for Australia and New Zealand. Our room on the 17th floor had commanding views along the river as far as the Marina Bay Hotel. The room was well decorated and freshly painted. There was an in-room safe and tea and coffee making facilities. Desk service and porters were helpful and attentive. we did not eat in the hotel so cannot comment on food options. Would stay again if in the area. </DOC> I was a little disappointed that there was no upgrade available for platinum guests but that seems to be the norm at this property with very few suites. Location is very good and service was warm and friendly. The bed is harder than I would prefer but everything was functional and AC worked well. It was nice to have washing machines and dryers available but S$10 for 1 wash is absolutely outrageous. </DOC> Its a Four Points so what to expect as we are level below Sheraton... BUT wow wow... you will get 5 star service at all levels, nice rooms in a great location and if you are Platinum member drinks in the bar for some happy hours. The hotel is just level above what i have experienced in Four Points hotels in other locations.. And you have a GM who is actually walking the floors and take time to speak to any guest that he meets on his way... Again stay here and you will come back ... for sure I will.. </DOC> Hotel is older but renovated with the rooms feeling freshly completed. The area is quiet, very quiet which might not be as expected for such a vibrant city. I didn't try t he food or drink here but the bar looked nice </DOC> Short visit to SG and as usual I stayed here. Apparently for the 10th time (there was handwritten letter by the manager welcoming me into the hotel..which was a nice gesture). The room was the usual comfortable room with a standing shower in the bathroom. I prefer the standing shower than the bathtub since the bathtub in these rooms in the hotel takes up too much space and I don't like curtains in the bathroom. The eatery was nice but at the breakfast they had a steamed fish which was really bland. The staff was really friendly and helpful as usual. The hotel has upgraded the treadmills in the gym which is great",

Staff were very friendly and helpful However the breakfast service can be quite chaotic and also I was waked up around 2.30am in the morning by some room service which was not ordered by me at all. I complained this with reception who said that they would make an investigation but I never received any feedback afterwards. </DOC> Stayed for 3 nights from 08-11 August for business and pleasure in Singapore. Location of this hotel is ideal to reach both the CBD and other tourist areas of the city. Check in process was smooth and quick and as a SPG Platinum guest I was allocated a nice room with river views. Breakfast buffet was extensive and highly satisfactory but unfortunately I did not get a chance to try the bar and happy hour. Didn't use the pool either but looked nice enough. One big disappointment however was the unloved gym, very small, cramped with low ceilings. Overall good value option for your business trip to Singapore </DOC> Four Points by Sheraton is a relatively newly refurbished hotel. As a regular visitor to Singapore this is the first time I have stayed in this property. I found it very presentable and comfortable. The rooms are spacious and clean. I found the staff very helpful for the entire length of my stay. The location of this property is on Havelock Road and backs up on to Singapore River close to a large variety of restaurants, Ochard Road and public transport and walking. I recommend this property and it is good value for money. </DOC> Hotel is quite large but has been recently refurbished it seems, the room was very modern and comfortable, easily on the higher end of the Four Points hotels we've stayed in. Swimming pool area is also quite nice, though the gym is unacceptably bad for a hotel of that size - it's basically an afterthought squeezed in to two little rooms that overheats. The location is great - it's on the river by Robertson quay, so you can just amble down the riverside to get most of the way down to Marina Bay if you want to. </DOC> Having spent a night trying to sleep off our jetlag we made the fatal mistake of wanting our breakfast just after 10am. No way Jose. Breakfast ends at 10am. You can order a la carte but no one wanted to serve us - pre occupied getting ready for a wedding. Hope it gets better at breakfast time over the next couple of days. A good hotel exists to serve the needs of its guests - not the other way round. </DOC> Was back again for a week on business last month. Location always is a big plus at this hotel. Plenty of places to walk around, and loads of food options around the property. Cleaning was done on time this time, and quite well which was a complaint I had last time around. Rest was fine and upto expectations. </DOC> Spent a week in Singapore for business and was happy with the hotel selection. Friendly staff, clean and comfortable rooms and a good location to go for a walk or simply to go for dinner or shopping. Recommended. </DOC> This was a second stay for a business trip. The meeting rooms had everything we needed and the service was excellent. The hotel is well located to be able to walk to restaurants and shopping. The hotels buffet is excellent, but the room service menu could use more healthy choices for lunches and dinners.",

I had an executive room which was on 14th floor and had a great view. Rooms are modern and super spacious. I loved the high ceilings. Breakfast and WiFi is usually included in room rates. Breakfast spread is good. I also had dinner at corriander kitchen with some guests and the food was delicious. All in all a good experience and recommend. </DOC> This is my second visit to this hotel, I just love it, top class in all aspects. Very good rooms, fantastic breakfast, excellent service. It\u2019s all that you are looking for. The ambience is just great. One of the best hotels I have stayed in at in recent times. </DOC> I've been a huge fan of another hotel in Pune - but when it was fully booked recently I came here on a recommendation. My business colleagues had claimed that the Conrad was nicer than the other property, but I didn't believe it until staying here. Now I have two favorite hotels in the cities to choose from. The property is quiet and grand. There were always a multitude of employees around to help direct me to where I wanted to go and to answer any questions that I had. The accommodations were clean and restful. Breakfast buffet was very good as were the onsite restaurants. My only wish is for a rooftop lounge to relax over a light dinner at night. The poolside facility outdoors on the 2nd floor was fine, but had a very limited menu and missed the ambiance and breeze of a rooftop. </DOC> Conrad is a great place to stay. The rooms are awesome. There is a TV on the bathroom mirror with a water proof remote ( very hi tech ) :) Great service and the food is excellent. Staff are very friendly and helpful Only thing missing are any shops ! </DOC> This is a really nice hotel - the rooms are spacious, service is great. Three very nice restaurants and a cafe - one coffee shop, one Japanese restaurant and one fine dining Indian. The hotel is very close to Koregaon park which has a very large number of restaurants. </DOC> Stayed here for 2 nights for a business and was wow'ed by the arrangements,food and service :-) :-) My recommnedations / observations include 1. Superb Property :-) .... 2. Fantastic ambience and service levels 3. Excellent restaurants 4. Great rooms and very well maintained toilets & toiletteries 5. Very fairly priced ... could be introduction pricing :-) Overall a GREAT place and am sure that i will be visiting again and again :-) :-) ... Strongly recommend this to all travellers to Pune :-) </DOC> Stayed at the Conrad during my business trip to Puna and found Conrad to be an extremely tasteful erected and well served hot property. It's service standards are extremely high and the food served by them is also of very supervisory level. </DOC> Although our check-in experience was far from perfect, we raised out concerns with the Duty Manager /Hotel\u2019s GM and things were put right as promptly as they could have been. We really enjoyed our stay: the hotel is new; nice design features throughout the property; our suite was functional and spacious; Executive Lounge has amazing views of Pune and offers a nice selection of snacks, beverages and drinks - all served with smile and attention by the amazing staff. Breakfasts were busy since the hotel seemed to be full during our stay however a lot of staff effort was put into organising and managing breakfast experience given a large number of guests.",

Instead, I found myself in a big, clean hotel, with a pleasant lobby and fast check-in. The room was REALLY impressive. Nice bathroom and huge space with lots of modern features. Location is also very good, as you can easily walk to a few decent restaurants in the area. Didn't get to enjoy the common areas but would still highly recommend it, it's a bargain! </DOC> Stayed for four nights in January during a business trip. Smooth check in, my room great. Large, opulent, had all the amenities one would want. Room Service was efficient with a good in room dining menu. Breakfast was excellent, wide selection and a great egg station. Hard to find fault with the hotel but will highlight two small ones, 1. water in the morning for shaving was at best luke warm 2. My room cardkey kept failing, 5 times in 4 days I had to visit Reception. Both these aside I would have no hesitation recommending the hotel. </DOC> It was weekend and I stayed for 2 nights. Check-in was very smooth and fast. Even at 11:30pm they managed room faster. Spacious room with good decoration and TV at bathroom.. mirror panel.. were good. Had issue with remote control of main TV.. solved instantly. Good food at breakfast time .. with many varieties to chose from. Service was excellent and very polite staff. Can recommend this place for stay while Pune visit. Nearby attractions.. Railway station and Airport.. adds value of selection. </DOC> A top class hotel when compared with international standards. Tall and large rooms, great views, comfortable beds, great electronics with little thoughtful details such as USB charging ports and fantastic bathrooms. Room service and housekeeping is super efficient and toiletries are top quality. The hotel has a great outdoor pool as also a very high quality gym. Perfect for a business traveller. It is located at the heart of the city within easy reach of businesses as well as tourist spots. </DOC> Its a great hotel. The food was excellent. Amazing spread at the breakfast. Must try the food n coffee by the lobby especially the hot chocolate. Excellent Decor, pool side n bar. Gym was also nice. A top notch property </DOC> It's a great hotel, located near koregaon park area on mangaldas road, this place promises to deliver the best of the services in their overall hospitality. Right from the smooth check in to the buffet meals, the quick room services to the housekeeping, everything was well taken care of. Simply perfect! The breakfast had so much to offer, the meal quality in t </DOC> This hotel is gorgeous, exuding opulent luxury while still managing to look modern. The bathrooms are sensational with separate showers and free standing soaking tubs. Also a hidden TV in the mirror if you like that sort of thing. The staff is incredibly professional, attentive and efficient. I was especially impressed by the housekeeper Pravin, who added a personal touch while taking care of my room. The buffet breakfast area is gorgeous and the variety excellent. The standard internet was very fast and consistent. Room service menu is 24 hours and the attention to detail old-school. If you have access to the Executive Lounge on the 13th floor, it has some really delicious snacks and a great happy hour served by friendly staff. This hotel went above and beyond my expectations. One of the better properties worldwide I have stayed at in recent years. Very impressed and would absolutely stay here again.",

        "docs": "When I think of this hotel, I remember the fantastic view of the hills of Kyoto... our room was facing North and had a huge window; we could see several temples in the distance! Awesome! Our room was really large, which worked great for our family of 4. We had a couch and a roll away bed, and really enjoyed our stay! The other big win for the Westin is the location. You can get to several of the main areas by walking. We had a car, so I'm not certain about the public transportation options, but I believe they have a shuttle as well. Overall it was a nice comfortable place to enjoy this unique city. If you want to have the familiarity of a big box hotel, this definitely works well. </DOC> It's a little outside the city core, but the subway station is right next door. The hotel is well maintained. Each floor is quite large and complex, but eventually you'll get ahold of the floor plan. The biggest gripe of mine is that our room is facing a grave yard 100 feet away... I really didn't enjoy the sight. Had some nightmares for the first two nights. I'd definitely request another view beforehand if I knew grave view might be possible... The service is really nice. They handled my Kikunoi reservation without a single problem. Another good thing is that you can just mention Miyako to any taxi driver in the city, and, no questions asked, you will arrive with only a 2000 yen taxi bill virtually from any corner of the city core. </DOC> Quick one night stay with friends.... Kyoto was absolutely beautiful!! Very quiet and felt like I really experienced the true Japanese culture. The hotel was located in a quiet area... Not far from the hot spots. Our room was a little small especially for two double beds.... but a great view of the city and had a balcony! The lobby is extremely inviting and large..... the concierge gave us excellent recommendations on nearby shows and restaurants. </DOC> Very nice hotel and stayed in a junior suite which was very spacious with modern facilities and amenities. Whilst not in the city centre, there is a regular shuttle bus. Hotel is sited near many temples within walking distance. </DOC> A large Westin hotel, that had all the necessary amenities and what you would expect from this chain. We found our room to be large and comfortable and had the best pillows we found in any hotel during our stay in Japan. Dined in a number of times and found restaurants to be of a good standard. Staff were obliging and helpful. Hotel is located in a very attractive area, when the cherry trees are out and it is only a short trip into the city centre. </DOC> Have spent 6 nights there over Christmas and I must say that I enjoyed my stay a lot! I was pretty reluctant to leave the place when I was checking out. Environment surrounding the hotel was great with some small cozy cafes I could go to for meals. It was also very near a Keage station which makes transport very convenient. Rooms were spacious enough and well maintained! Housekeeping staffs always does a good job when cleaning up the rooms and made it a point to greet you along the passageway no matter how busy they were. Free shuttle service also provide to and from Kyoto station with stops in between. The fitness center has adequate facilities for a good workout! I am very satisfied with my stay and hope to be back again in the near future!! </DOC> Well-known classic hotel a little bit out of the way but still offers good value for money. The rooms are getting a little bit tired and could do with some refreshing. The hotel offers excellent regular shuttle service to the city and the train station, and there is a subway station very close by. </DOC> While the hotel may look slightly far away on the map, it is well served by a frequent shuttle bus from kyoto station. Rooms are generously sized and very comfortably accommodated my family of 5. We had an excellent stay and would not hesitate to recommend this property for the service despite the slightly aged interiors of the hotel. The gardens are also beautifully kept",

Shuttle will take you to / from the train station, so this makes a nice overnight trip out from Tokyo. It's an easy walking distance to several shrines. </DOC> we had 2 days of family vacation here and it was quite rememberable ..although its a bit run down hotel but still nice and good location ... staff were good ...wish they can improve breakfast quality and do better job of cleaning </DOC> There was nothing wrong with this hotel - just not our 'cup of tea' - it was far too impersonal - and geared towards large groups - weddings and had a very corporate feel to it. Being asked to sign for and threatened to be charged if you didn't return a adaptor really summed it up. The restaurants were very large and impersonal - breakfasts were massed produced.It was very expensive One positive was that it had a shuttle bus to the station. Wouldn't use it again. </DOC> The hotel is isolated and is a twenty-minute hotel shuttle bus ride from the train station. This bus is small and is therefore very crowded. Often it is necessary to wait for the next bus. Unlike Kyoto Train Station and downtown Kyoto, nearby restaurants are sparse and one is therefore a captive to expensive hotel dining. The best alternative for dining is to take the bus to the train station to have dinner and to pick up pastries for breakfast. We found the hotel staff, especially at the front desk, dining room, and lobby, to be unappreciative and inhospitable. Our triple room was adequate in size, but the furnishings in the rooms and common areas appear worn and outdated. </DOC> We stayed 4 nights and frankly this place was an oasis following an unsatisfactory stay at our previous hotel on the tour. The room was of a fair size for Japan, the beds comfortable, the WiFi and electronics all worked, though storage space was a bit limited. This is a huge hotel, and so be prepared for lengthy walks to and from the lifts (elevators). The staff are courteous and helpful, and there is a good choice of restaurants on site. Buffet breakfasts were well stocked and enjoyable. The bar has good views and a reasonable atmosphere (although the music can be too loud at times). The shuttle into town is an asset, so long as you can find the pick-up point at the labyrinthine station. Not the most modern of Westins, but still very good. </DOC> Efficient check in and helpful staff. Location was good to visit tourist attractions. The rooms were spacious clean and nice to sleep and rest in. There were local and unique restaurants near the place. </DOC> The hotel is located on the eastern end of the city and near a subway line. From Kyoto Station there is a free shuttle bus which brings you to the hotel and vice versa. Deluxe room had a sofa and balcony with some nice views. The Westin Executive Lounge was located in a small place with very limited seating. The only saving grace were the views. Breakfast and evening cocktail hours serves extremely light food which was underwhelming. PHOTO ALBUM www.flickr.com/photos/lcpteck/sets/72157650605255738/ </DOC> This hotel is well situated in Kyoto for visiting places of interest or just walking around. The rooms vary from Japanese traditional to Western mid century style. The Western rooms are well kept but many people think they are dated. The rooms size also varies a lot. The hotel has a nice view over gardens and Kyoto. The breakfast buffet has a broad range of food that is impressive. The staff are pleasant and helpful. The room rate is expensive here - for a similar yen you can stay at the Okura where the interior of the hotel is grander and more luxurious even though it may not be as well positioned.",

Our room was very very small and quite far away from elevators. No caution or written guidance to tourists from the hotel on the approaching typhoon. Food was unfortunately not good. The tourist guide, sweet girl at front desk spoke good English and was highly knowledgeable. At check out we struggled with google translator on how to make them aware that I am SPG member since years and stayed only for a few hours; but all in vail ;somehow escaped. The man admitted that he can\u2019t follow English and called upon another lady. Probably this is one of the best properties but we didn\u2019t spent much time at Kyoto. May not come back to same hotel. </DOC> The Westin here is a beautiful hotel. It is very large and has many amenities. The buffet breakfast is Eastern and Western and you will certainly find many things you would like to eat. The linens are very nice and every bathroom is equipped with a Toto toilet. That is always fun for tourists. I will say that I was disappointed when they went to the pool to find out that even if you\u2019re staying in the hotel it cost 550 yen which is the equivalent of about five dollars to use the pool. Can\u2019t understand why they would do that. </DOC> our rooms were very big!! we had adjoining rooms with our other friends! great views from our large balconies also!! nice bathrooms, no complaints at all!! the shuttle service provided from the train station was very helpful too. </DOC> This is my second stay at the Westin Miyako and just like the last one was a good stay. Was upgraded to a suite with Bulgari amenities. Needless to say the suite was very well appointed and service was excellent. The hotel is located near the woods which is beautiful. Kyoto is compact enough and it was not more than 10 minutes of taxi ride everywhere we went. Will definitely stay again. </DOC> We stayed here when visiting Japan. The staff were friendly and everything in the room was functional and plain as you would expect from a Westin. The breakfast and food was great also. I'd definitely recommend this hotel. </DOC> Yes it is an older Hotel but our room is newly renovated and confortable the bathrooms are old style and small, I like the entrance and the generous lobby, there are a lot of groups but the service is exellent in all areas.we are a familly of nine . Our children do not like the pool it is old but we have been at the new Andaz Hotel in Tokyo before we came here...to be short I would say good value for the money ! </DOC> The service at this hotel is unparalleled. I was pleasantly surprised from the moment I walked in the front door until checkout. The room was dated, but there appears to be an ongoing room renovation in parts of the hotel. Housekeeping, the front desk staff, the bellmen and even the hotel shuttle driver were all extremely accommodating as well as the Blu restaurant staff on the second floor and the catering and banquet crews. </DOC> I stayed here for 3 nights with my son and husband. Our room was spacious, and had a balcony we could sit on and take in a nice view of the city around. The beds were very firm, and the bathroom was well equipped with fancy electronic toilet that can clean you wherever you want. The shower had great water pressure. Room service was efficient. The entire staff was very helpful and welcoming. The breakfast buffet wasn't huge, but it was enough to start the day well. We had no troubles communicating with anyone in English, which I very much appreciated. We were very comfortable here!",

        "docs": "The west wing has been renovated to a high standard so stay on this side. There is a large pool with plenty of beds. Despite the tall buildings nearby the sun reaches most places around the pool. Parking is underground and is charged at MYR 10 per day for hotel guests. The hotel is located by the monorail station Bukit Nanas making it easy to reach Bukit Bintang. Walking distance to KLCC. </DOC> I generally stay at the Le Meridien (which is my favourite) but their rooms were over booked so decided to try this hotel. Despite some of the poor reviews on this site, I can say that this is better if not comparable to LMKL! Rooms (west wing) are more spacious and well appointed. Bed thread count is lower than the Le Meridien but rooms have a bathtub and are well stocked with tokyo milk amenities. Service was excellent, staff are polite but not too intrusive. Only slight downer was the weaker spread at breakfast relative to the Le Meridien or other 5 star properties in general but i did not see overwhelming crowds on the Tuesday morning at 8am as reported here. The new club lounge is awesome too. Will be back! </DOC> Hotel just doesnt impress, from check in at a different 'wing' from where i am staying (not mentioned in pre-check-in email). To a cold, poorly designed room that looks like it was decorated by a 4 year old... Two tv's in suite but only one remote, no room service menu. Headed of the the lounge which i was told had 'late evening snacks', turned out to be a slice of cake and some peanuts. Ordered room service to get an undercooked, disgusting pizza. Not impressed... </DOC> Great value hotel with 5 star amenities at business class hotel prices. At half the price of the JW Marriott which is at Jalan Bukit Bintang, it is certainly value for money. Rooms all upgraded and got a surprise when upgraded to the club floor. Didn't have time to go to the pool but difficult to find hotels with such large pools these days. So if you want the Marriott service level at affordable prices, this is one hotel you should consider seriously. Train station a 5 mins walk away. Only setback is not located next to any premium mall. </DOC> I have rated this average because of the extremely slow check in with no apology. Not professional. At busy times a huge hotel should have a number of staff to attend needs. BAD - extremely slow check in. - noisy room with banging from the constructions on busing opposite. - no plug near bed side. GOOD - location is 10 mins walk from Petronas Towers. - good toiletries selection. - large spacious, modern clean rooms. - gorgeous pool area. </DOC> I am normally used to stay at the JW Marriott not too far away, but this hotel seemed more interesting price wise at the time of booking, so I decided to give it a try, and to be honest, I have been pretty impressed... Upon arriving, I was upgraded to a suite, and what a nice room. Suites are normally 2 rooms linked together, but here it felt more like a 1 bedroom apartment, very modern. Large king size comfortable bed, 2 large screen TVs and plenty of movie channels. Lounge club on 25 floor is nice place to have snack on the evening or breakfast in the morning, and service is always done with a smile. Definitely recommended. </DOC> checked in for just one night. was upgraded to Lifestyle Room due to Platinum membership status. special thanks to Anson Chow, the Assistant FO Manager who assist me with my request. really appreciate it. the room was spacious and faced the Petronas Twin Tower. very comfy mattress, pillows. spacious bathroom, great water pressure for shower. was given access to the West Wing Lounge. the male staff at the reception not so friendly. the chef manning the cooking station was great. having problems with room card for one of the rooms and had it recoded few times at the lobby. check out fast. will return. </DOC> Room on club level has obviously had a makeover, yet the build up of mould around shower and grouting doesn't inspire confidence. I did ask for it to be thoroughly cleaned, yet a week later was still waiting. The lounge itself is pretty good of the price paid. The spirits are best left untouched - the sort of local label rubbish that's best drunk in a shop doorway after 10 years of a Labour government. Best aspect was the friendly breakfast team on the lobby level. For a hotel that offers a potentially great \"hard product\", the execution is oddly flawed. A few too many niggles meant that I moved to the Sheraton after a couple of weeks.",

One criticism is the lack of any atmosphere in the \"sports\" bar where they show old football and tennis matches. Nothing recent at all. Drinks reasonably priced at happy hour but don't get the logic of why only one type of beer available on happy hour pricing when both are the same price at other times. Odd. Wasn't too impressed with the buffet, either at breakfast or dinner. Food lacked flavour, maybe dumbed down for tourists. Pool is large and plenty of seating. Would return. </DOC> The hotel itself is quite an old property, but very big with two wings. The room I was given faced the Petronas tower, so a beautiful view, however, I wish the windows were more clean and clear which would offer a better view. The room and bed was comfortable. Room service dine in options were very tasty and service was good. Breakfast has a huge and wide variety and makes for a nice comfortable dining experience. It is centrally located and has a lot of restaurants, bars, malls close by with a discotheque in the hotel itself. Overall a nice experience! </DOC> The hotel is in a great location and it looks like it should be really nice. I think it either once was great and is now tired, or it is still striving to be good. Unfortunately, it feels tired and old and the service is poor. We stayed for 3 days and had breakfast every morning - it was always cold. Not Luke warm, cold! If we wanted tea or coffee, we had to search someone out who could help us. Not great. </DOC> Centrally location, with a view of both Twin towers and KL Tower. Rooms are elegant and tastefully done. Food was a bit of a let down though. Though we stayed for just once day, we had a great experience. </DOC> Stayed for 5 nights prior to and as part of a tour. In general the hotel was great, good service by reception / concierge for taxi etc. The breakfast was amazing, such a great choice. Our room was in the East Wing overlooking the towers. The beds were really comfortable but the room was a little dark. The lighting system on a control panel was a real faff and didn't always work. Great complimentary toiletries in the bathroom. The other downsides where the plumbing - the toilet flush wasn't great and there didn't seem to be much cold water to the bathroom basin so you were cleaning your teeth with warm water! The other niggle was the small handles on the wardrobe doors making them difficult to open. Other than that everything was spot on and I would certainly recommend the hotel and stay again if I was in KL. </DOC> The Hotel is undergoing a renovation and we were originally in the wing being renovated. The staff graciously upgraded our room and moved us into a new suite. The amenities in the renovated room and club access were amazing. </DOC> The hotel is strategically located 5 walking min away from the Petronas towers. Room are spacious and clean. The gym and the pool area are really nice. Fantastic the private breakfast room on the top floor. It will definitely be my busisess trip hotel in KL. </DOC> A great hotel, this Renaissance its conveniently located just a few blocks away from the KLLC and around the corner of a train station. Rooms are very nice and spacious, with lovely views of the KL Tower and the rest of the city. Bathroom its also very spacious and the water pressure its great. The only downsize might the breakfast that its located in a rather small area compared to the amount of people that its served but I liked a lot the options that it offer with both asian and western dishes. Staff were very nice and helpful all the time and we kind enough to help with any request. The pool and the pool bar were great and after it was refurbish recently it was even better. A nice place to stay for sure.",

The best thing I can say is that the staff is great, going out of their way to deliver good service and really trying. The hotel, though, is a dump in need over a refresh. The elevators are slow, and extremely loud (don't pick a room by the elevator bank). The restaurant is mediocre, except for the breakfast buffet which is a total rip-off (BRL75 for a meager buffet with few options). The downstairs bar has poor service, forgetting our table multiple times. Bathroom amenities are so pedestrian, I didn't take any for my home! And the bathroom water smells bad. Best thing I could say is that the hotel location is pretty good, in a nice safe area with good jogging areas around it. But I won't stay here again. </DOC> Stayed for a weekend in Sao Paolo, as MR Plat got upgraded room (1 level up) and free breakfast and lounge. Breakfast is with great variety of food. Lounge is huge and full of food and drinks. Hotel has a pool If will come back to Sao Paolo will come back again to Renaissance. </DOC> We enjoyed our quick stay at the Renaissance. We were upgraded to a suite which was large and comfortable with a sitting room and a separate bedroom. The bed was comfortable and the room was very clean. The AC worked well.

After staying there over 15 times the hotels has a great location. Not sure why I always get a lousy room at this hotel. As a Marriott elite reward member I wasn\u2019t greet as repeat and loyal member. Not a nice room. My shower was broken and the faucet couldn\u2019t be adjusted. Not comfortable. Rooms are getting very tired and elevators cards malfunction. All the time. Service was fair in general. Breakfast was fine very hard to find a waiter for coffee. Lobby bar waiters needs a little more training. Our group always waiving in order to get waiter service. Just not to a Marriott Renaissance Standards. </DOC> Just spent one night at the Renaissance but found the service to be excellent as well as the accommodation in the Madison Suite. The check in/check out process was very smooth helped by the great service offered by Luigi at the front desk. The breakfast buffet offered a huge selection of items in the restaurant while the club lounge was very relaxing and offered nice snacks and free drinks at happy hour.

Would definitely stay here again on a future visit to Sao Paulo. </DOC> This is a good hotel, mind you, but not worth US$300 per night. Rooms are small, the personnel bureaucratic and the hotel has petty charges for internet use, mineral water (US$5 per bottle), etc. Don't expect a view. Room had a faint smell of mildew. Location is excellent for those doing business in this part of town, also close to good restaurants, etc. An expensive dress shirt was forgotten in the room, but \"not found\" by the cleaning staff. </DOC> I stayed in this hotel recently. I travel all over the world very frequently. This hotel is so old and ordinary. I am perplexed to pay 300 usd/ night for it. The Good :- 1. front desk was super polite and helpful. 2. Free internet in room ( unlike some other fancy SP hotels) 3. complimentary water bottle available. The bad :- 1. Old building 2. Old looking room and bathroom 3. the elevators take for ever to arrive and are packed in peak hours. Will i return? No..not for 300 usd/night! Do i recommend? Only if you have money to burn!

We love this hotel as we got married there last year but we keep on coming back as it never fails us! </DOC> For us a very convenient location with just about everything you need nearby. Lots of bars and restaurants down the hill - but they are a long walk back up. The pronunciation of the hotels name is tricky and taxi drivers seemed particulalry dim at catching it. However that is not the hotel's fault! Had a room with access to the \"lounge\" on the 23rd floor. This was valuable for quick breakfast and a catch up drink with colleagues at the end of the working day. The rooms were decent in size and comfortable,and everything was well maintained although I think getting a little dated. Friendly and helpful staff and sensible value for money. Will return happily. </DOC> Great location, lovely staff, complementary caiparinha always welcome and delicious breakfast. BUT during the night there was a big storm. The power kept going out and coming back and every time it came back on - the TV would turn on. We had one night between overnight flights - it was not restful. But, I'm not sure if we wouldn't have the same problem at the other high end hotels... </DOC> Very standard Renaissance. Staff where excellent and efficient. I loved the pool area which was a real sun trap and the food and drink was brilliant. I do wish they would consider placing more coffee in the rooms however. All in all a pleasant stay and I hope to return again some day. </DOC> We chose tis hotel at random after a delayed flight provided the opportunity for a night in Sao Paulo. The hotel is quality with very attentive staff. We were treated to a glass of champagne while checking in. The hotel has a theatre and night club. We had a good night in the latter.

You can reach Golden Temple in 20 minutes and Wagah Border in 45 minutes. This is a huge property with all luxurious amenities. Rooms are very spacious and nicely done. Toiletries are of premium quality. Bed is very comfortable. There is a minibar in the room. They have fitness centre and wonderful swimming pool. Food quality is exceptional. Overall highly recommended for families and business travelers. Pls like if you found this useful. </DOC> The hotel is well out of the centre. It\u2019s a nice size and the attention you get from all the staff is first class. They are all smartly dressed and go out of their way to help you. A very good start to our tour. </DOC> Quite different from the last Taj hotel I stayed in but the constant is the level of service. Reception staff in particular were incredibly helpful in assisting with our onward travel plans. Rooms spacious with all the amenities one would expect in a high end city hotel. Nice bar area with attentive staff and excellent cocktails. Breakfast was good. This hotel made an excellent base for our two days in Amritsar. My only slight criticism is that at breakfast the serving of hot drinks took too long. This, however, didn\u2019t detract rom a very enjoyable stay. </DOC> This may not be as lavish as the other Taj properties but everything else is very \u201cTaj\u201d... Great service from the people , good rooms , good location etc... All the boxes ticked for a very comfortable stay.... </DOC> We had a wonderful stay at the Taj Swarna. It was perfect and I must say that it was mainly due to the care and attention of the front office manager Akashdeep Mathur. You have in him a person who embodies hospitality. He was at the front always ensuring all his guests were being looked after. An amazing hotelier. Apart from him the conceirge was superb. The food at the restaurant was delightful. The chef must be commended. And the staff at the restaurant were very good. </DOC> Stayed overnight in April17. The Hotel is set behind a mall and has an impressive structure. The lobby is impressive with many staff fawning over few guests. The room is tastefully done but strangely with just one hard back chair to the work desk (and this was in the club floor leaving one to wonder what would it be in other floors). They have two restaurants and the mall that is behind this has no great eating place. Overall a good place if one were to splurge but regulars in Amritsar or those with a certain level of patience can locate better options at half this price. </DOC> Excellent hotel in a convenient location. The staff were absolutely fantastic and provided great attention to detail. The breakfast buffet was sumptuous and they definitely made the best dosas out of all the hotels we stayed in on this trip.",

        "docs": "An excellent hotel that has very good facilities. Nice rooms, very spacious and well furnished, comfortable bed and pillows. The facilities were very good. The best part was the people at the hotel. One of the most friendliest and helpful team that we have seen in our travels and they were always there to help. They went above and beyond to help and address any questions we had. They were very knowledgeable about the city and were very helpful with their recommendations. The duty manager, the chef and their drinks manager were always around to follow up after their team. A very pleasant experience and made our short trip to Amritsar a pleasure. Last but not least the food in their restaurant was amazing. Highly recommend for you to stay here if your travels bring you to Amritsar. </DOC> We stayed at this property 8,9th of Nov. Check in was comfortable. Buffet layout presentation good.Services at restaurant excellent.Special thanks to Mr Rajan for booking and concern. Look forward for another stay at this place again. </DOC> We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Taj Swarna, from the moment we arrived to our departure, the service was excellent and our requests were dealt with swiftly. We enjoyed breakfasts in the main restaurant, they were excellent with a good range of options. We dined in the evening in the Chinese Room, again this was excellent. The level of personal service was true to Taj form and we would not hesitate in staying here again. The spa offers a luxurious range of treatments, we sampled the 2 hour treatment - super relaxing! </DOC> Yes another perfect Taj Prooerty . Nice hospitality , great food and very we located. Not in a bustling street but still only about 15/20 minutes away from the Golden Temple. Do stop by at their Bar on the ground floor. It's a happening place and well done. </DOC> The Taj Swarna is a lovey modern hotel. We arrived to a lovely surprise of a cake and flowers congratulating us on our recent engagement. They were very thoughtful. We had room service at the hotel the first night. It was good and lots of options. </DOC> We spend two lovely days in this hotel. The staff could not have been friendlier. The room was beautiful and very big. The restaurant food was superb better than any other restaurants in Amritsar. The only slight disappointment was that we could not use the fantastic looking swimming pool. This was not the fault of the hotel but due to the bad smog.. </DOC> Taj is one of the finest in the hospitality business. The property is quite new, the check in was extremely smooth and the rooms are spacious and well decorated. The property has nice lawns and a lovely restaurant and a bar. The breakfast spread is huge and quality of service and food is par excellence. The best part of this property is that it is in the city and at the same time little further away from hustle and bustle of the town. </DOC> This hotel is amazing - the ambience, the service, the bar and the food are all outstanding. The service is better than the usually exceptional Taj service. Special mention for Vipin at \u2018 The Peg\u2019 which is the bar - super service and recommendations. The buffet breakfast is the best ever with so much variety and tasty stuff. The staff who manage the buffets are very friendly and courteous and specially Prem who ensures you are served well.",

        "docs": "This is our third Cinnamon hotel we have stayed at in Sri Lanka. Each has had fabulous rooms, good service and excellent food. We have come to look forward to the next hotel, which is certainly not something we normally do when traveling! </DOC> Good hotel at a scenic location. We got a room on the second floor with a great view of the lawns and the river. The poolside bar ambience was also great. Good variety in the breakfast buffet. Since it was off season it was not too crowded either. Only downside is that the hotel is not located in the city so there is nothing within walking distance. However this was not a problem for us as we had rented a cab. </DOC> This is definitely within the upper category in Kandy but no uniqueness to this hotel compare to the others. Everything is nice and within my expectations except the billing and directions within. My checkout took more than 30 min and I am still not happy with the process and the way it was handled. I never expect such a sloppy billing system jn a star class hotel. This hotel must have additional directional guidance within the hotel as the current guidance is confusing. </DOC> We stayed two nights here while visiting Kandy. The hotel was just perfect, great chalet style room on the top floor with a close up balcony view of the beautiful river and its birdlife, helpful and attentive staff, a good buffet and lovely pool area. The best hotel of our Sri Lankan tour! </DOC> Stayed there just for one night, but had a very pleasant stay. The location of the hotel on the river is nice; on the outskirts of town so nice and quiet but it will take you 10-15 minutes by tuk-tuk to get into town. The pool is very nice, as is the bar with a view over of the river. </DOC> The hotel is situated in a quiet location a short tuk tuk ride outside the center of Kandy. The rooms have been updated and we enjoyed a very nice bathroom a kind of retro colorful bedroom and a beautiful space outside with table and chairs facing the river. Lots of pretty birds to watch and a nice garden. We had dinner at the a la carte restaurant and experienced excellent service and very good food. The breakfast buffet was wonderful. As individual travelers we enjoyed good help from the entire staff while making preparations for going to our next destination. </DOC> Located by the river with lots of bird activity. Comfortable rooms with Wi if throughout the hotel Very good buffet for breakfast and dinner, with plenty of choice. Easy drive to the Temple of the Tooth and the Botanical Gardens </DOC> As ever in my experience of this hotel chain the outstanding feature is the staff - whoever is responsible for the staff training programme deserves a huge bonus. The hotel is modern with great views across the river. We only ate at the buffet which was good and varied both for breakfast and dinner. We stayed in a de luxe room over the restaurant with a small balcony overlooking the river. The room was of good size and the wifi worked in the room. I gave great views of a thunderstorm one evening.",

        "docs": "Stayed one night with a tour group. That seems to be the bulk of the clientele. This would be a place to stay if you had a tour guide to pick you up daily, but I wouldn't recommend if you were driving yourself. Too far to walk into Kandy! Room was attractive and comfortable. The decor is retro but did not feel tired or old. Full board meals are all buffet; nothing much to write home about. Lobby is beautiful. Nice place to sit and chat; overlooks pool and lake. </DOC> This hotel in the hills outside of Kandy is a major overnight destination for tourists (there were many buses parked outside and the hotel was full of people on package tours (other than our small group). The lobby has a lovely bar facing a large swimming pool (great for laps) and the river. There is a large dining room upstairs that served excellent Sri Lankan food and, unlike many locations in the country, had a decent wine list and super friendly, efficient service. The rooms were spacious and clean, and there was free wireless throughout the premises. Plus the hallways where the rooms were located had a faint aroma of cinnamon. A lovely place for a visit! </DOC> The hotel has everything that you expect from a luxury hotel except maybe the elevators. However, one experience that I highly recommend is a boat ride on Mahaweli River & float in the middle of greenery & watch birds and water monitors. </DOC> This is our 3rd Cinnamon Hotel while on tour and is enjoyable as the others. A warm towel and refreshing drink provided at each stop at check in. Attentive and mindful employee's such as Sudarshan and Ranil to help with your needs. As usual at a Cinnamon Hotel a nice and Large buffet of food choices. Clean and spacious rooms. Outdoor pool to relax in or outside of. If any complaints they would be so minor to the overnight stay. </DOC> This was our favourite hotel during our 2 week tour. It is in a stunning setting just outside Kandy with its traffic and crowds. The view of the gardens and the river from our room was amazing. We enjoyed walking around the gardens before and after our daily excursions. This is a welcome haven of tranquillity after Kandy. There are hammocks in the gardens and lots of birds that will come up really close. The pool was lovely and I was the only person using it one afternoon between heavy showers. The staff are friendly and very helpful. The food was the usual buffet but all very fresh and plenty to eat. If I came back to Kandy I would definitely stay here again and for longer than our 2 night stay. </DOC> Through its location on the shore of a river and surrounded by a lush green vegetation this hotel gives a real tropical feel. From the lofty colonial styled lobby you have a nice view over the pool area down to the riverside. The hotel is a perfect place to relax as it is a bit outside of the main town center - however only a stone throw away from all the major sites of Kandy. Rooms are cosy and clean - maybe the corridors give some older impressions, but everything is well maintained. Food was also super delicious and can be enjoyed on the terrace overlooking the beautiful surroundings. See more info on the hotel and activities on traveltreasuresbymarion - my favorite place in the hotel was in the hammock down at the river. </DOC> One of the highlights of our Sri Lanka Trip was staying here in absolute luxury. A slight mix up led to our kids getting up a bit cramped, but it was still worth the experience. Absolute amazing view of the river, and very good amenities like swimming pool. Located a little away from the city but the view was certainly worth it. Breakfast was superb, so also overall service. </DOC> Superb quality hotel, rooms spacious and clean, internet included. Bar area overlooking pool and river. Look out for the fruit bats flying up river early evening. Food excellent quality and varied dishes to suit the many internationals on tours that use the hotel.",

        "docs": "Nice and clean hotel facing the big river. Open swimming pool works till 10pm. The room was very big and the terrasse, too. The breakfast was big enough. Thanx to God the local music band stopped playing at lobby at 11pm. </DOC> Of all the places we stayed in Sri Lanka, this was the least good (I won't say 'worst' because it wasn't that bad). It has a lovely location and really nice rooms. But, you can tell it's a chain hotel because the staff just don't seem to have any particular care. The meals we had here were okay (buffet was provided for breakfast and dinner) but was pretty bland. Restaurant service, apart from one very junior waiter who was friendly and tried to be helpful, was abysmal. Unless you were in one of the big tour groups (or a male - more than once the waiters stopped serving us to serve a man at a nearby table instead) it was nearly impossible to get coffee or tea at breakfast, or a drink at dinner. The same applied to service around the pool area which was extremely slow. </DOC> This is an outstanding property and we had a wonderful stay here. Wish we could have stayed longer. Our room was large and spacious with a balcony overlooking the garden and the river. The hotel has a beautiful pool and a restaurant. They served a delicious buffet dinner and a large wholesome spread for breakfast. The staff is warm and welcoming and service excellent. I would recommend this hotel to anyone holidaying in Kandy. I would love to return here. </DOC> As a previous reviewer said this is an ok hotel, nothing special but large clean rooms, friendly staff and reasonable buffet food served in a large un-inspiring restaurant. Food is also served in the bar. We were in a room numbered on what we thought was on the 3rd floor but we had to pass rooms numbered in the 200's before going down stairs to our level!! The room was a fair distance from reception and close to the road. </DOC> We loved this hotel. The room was very comfortable and the whole hotel is lovely. We ate in the upmarket restaurant in the evening and the food was very good. Breakfast also had a good selection. The pool was open late which we appreciated having arrived late and only having a one night stay. Good wifi. Expensive for Sri Lanka but we had a very comfortable stay. </DOC> We arrived late in the evening and left after breakfast, but we would for sure have loved to stay longer to really take in the scenery. Rooms are spacious with a fabulous view. The hotel is rather large so you might risk walking a bit to find your room. We had dinner in the restaurant, which is a buffet. It seems as if a lot of larger tour groups visit the place, so it's very loud and impossible to have a conversation. I would recommend to eat elsewhere. At breakfast everything was calm and quiet so I guess the groups had left early. </DOC> A wonderful hotel in a great setting. We were fortunate enough to have a garden room with terrace although it was far too hot to sit out there whilst we were there. The breakfast/lunch/dinner restaurant was very good, but we enjoyed the cafe by the swimming pool for 2 evening meals as it was much quieter. Staff were helpful and very friendly. </DOC> The Citadel is perched on a hillside, accessible along a long, winding road several km away from the city. It feels secluded and quiet, as you're overlooking the river below the hotel. But the hotel feels old to me. The rooms, while a good size, appear dated, with dark wooden ceilings and tiled floors. The beds were comfortable (we asked for King, got twins almost pushed together), and the bathroom was good. The outdoor pool was nice, but filled with kids (the hotel attracts a lot of families). The food in the cafes and the bars were pretty good, and the service was also attentive and friendly. Overall, a good stay. Great staff, great food. Just needs a big makeover.",

Breakfast is good and served with smile . Top floor rooms have better views . Thanks to all . </DOC> Big, beautiful located and decorated hotel. Good size rooms with large balcony facing the river as well as jungle. Large pool with sufficient beds and umbrellas. Staff alert and kind. Comfortable beds in a spotless hotel room. WiFi functioned well all over the hotel. Check-in and check-out service could be somewhat quicker, but we more or less experienced this all over Sri Lanka. Hotel offers free accommodation for a driver, but his meals are not included (not expensive though) </DOC> In a good location outside Kandy with riverside and jungle views. Good balcony, although too hot to use. The accommodation lacks character but was very comfortable and had everything you could need. As with the other Cinnamon hotels we have stayed in the food was very good and there was an abundance of choice. Overall an excellent two night stay. </DOC> There were no major problems with this hotel but a series of minor issues that whilst trivial on their own, when taken together mean I could not describe it as very good. When we arrived our room had a broken chair, a broken plug in the wash hand basin, and a broken toilet seat. When we complained these were dealt with expeditiously, but these should have been corrected earlier. Other irritations were the fact that we could not sleep until after 11:00 on our first night because of loud music emanating from the bar, and the air conditioning system being so noisy as to prevent sleep. Finally we were disappointed with the meal service in the bar area which was somewhat lackadaisical. As I said all trivial irritations on their own but taken together suggest there is room for improvement. </DOC> The rooms were spacious but were on ground floor with no elevator service. We had to walk 2 stories up to reach the reception and dining area. If climbing stairs is an issue, insist on having at least the first floor. The dining area was crowded but below an excellent level. the food quality can be improved. Overall, the staff people were helpful. </DOC> We stayed here two nights as part of our tour. We stayed at three Cinnamon hotels and they were all really good and this one was no exception. Fantastic staff, food and in an excellent location with excellent views over the river. The restaurant was great and again the views during the day and night from the bar and restaurant were stunning. Excellent group of hotels. </DOC> Great location, lovely property with nice layout and the service was good. Wasn\u2019t to impressed by the food, don\u2019t get me wrong it wasn\u2019t poor, just not as good as I expected. Nevertheless, a really nice stay and I would return. </DOC> It\u2019s more than amazing. Firstly I would like to thank the hotel for the my birthday surprise for decorating my room and the view they choosing for me. I\u2019m super happy for the 3 nights I spend it. Staff is helpful and professional . They made everything for us with happiness.breakfast buffet, pool bar and caf\u00e9 C all there food is yummy and delicious. Location for the hotel wonderful .

I loved being in the centre of town but cocooned in a lovely estate. My only complaint is that the beds are too hard. Otherwise a stunning hotel that won't disappoint. </DOC> Every detail and sober at the Imperial. It has so much history!! It has all these pictures of the most important maharajas meetings at it. Rooms are big and every restaurant worth de visit. Very good pool and spa, complimentary yoga lessons, adaptors etc. </DOC> Right in the middle of everything, shopping at Janpath , Pallika bazar , Connaught Place , all at walking distance .Plenty of restaurants n street food options available around the hotel .Rooms were good , had colonial feel to it , good size , have been modernised too according to time. Their south Asian restaurant serves awesome Chinese , really finger licking good , but everything comes with a price -Awseome but expensive. </DOC> This is the most beautiful hotel you could possibly stay in. Lovely rooms, delicious food, friendly and helpful staff etc.etc. I particularly enjoyed the swimming pool (which is huge). I also very much enjoyed the free morning swimming aerobic class - the teacher was excellent!! </DOC> Stayed one night in this place whilst on business in Delhi. I did like everything. The room was big, and well decorated, with very comfortable bed. The bathroom was wide, with all amenities needed. Breakfast is royal, with full range of recipes, and drinks. The staff are very nice, and so prompt to meet any need you may have. This is a really imperial hotel. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who can afford the price. </DOC> My second visit to The Imperial and I appreciate absolutely everything about it. Service is second to none and for the first time I used the Spa. I had an Ayurvedic massage (oil drips on your forehead at the end of the massage) by Dolma from Tibet. I have experienced many massages and this was exemplary. Do treat yourself to this SPA as it definitely enhances a wonderful visit. The SPA management is very kind and it was a pleasure speaking to the Manageress. I will be sad to leave my cocoon of pleasantness...... thanks Imperial, you get it right..... </DOC> After the chaos of India the tranquility of New Delhi is made even better when you enter the grounds of the Imperial. From the tall turbaned doormen to the lovely nostalgic decor of a grand hotel, it is absolutely enchanting. So much so that we paid the equivalent of Aus$240 for a bottle of Moet after being unable to find any decent wines prior so far on our trip. It was worth it as was the opportunity to soak up the atmosphere in the bar. Breakfast was abundant and varied and a delightful start to the day. Our room was very comfortable. </DOC> We were having a hard time deciding where to stay since the Oberoi was undergoing refurbishment. So we finally picked the Imperial and what a good choice that was. Public areas were spotless. Breakfast in the Wintergarden was a treat every morning. Spicy route was very good and service in general was very good. Also, grounds were beautiful and pool area very nice. And a sense of history pervades the whole property. Only the standard rooms felt a little tired and in need of some update. However in general a very nice hotel and certainly more authentic than the other modern palaces of Delhi.",

A good thing about this hotel was that we had an early departure and they would deliver an early breakfast to our room, at no extra cost, so long as it was before 6am. This was a big help to us. The dining service at breakfast on our first day was very ordinary, compared to others we have had at five star hotels in India. It was hard to get the attention of staff. We ate at two of the restaurants and the food and service were excellent. Staying here was like staying in an art gallery - there were corridors of lithographs, we couldn't see them all. It was also like staying in a time capsule, in an India that doesn't exist any more, so if thats your thing, you are right at home here! </DOC> This is a very high quality restaurant, but this makes it rather stuffy and pretentious (especially some of the guests). Everything you should expect from a 5 start hotel - great pool, great rooms, enormous breakfast etc. </DOC> India is an extraordinarily complex country in which multiple languages and multiple religions can overwhelm the western visitor. The Imperial Hotel remembers through art and artefacts the difficult past and drives forward into a confident future. The highest standards are applied to every single aspect of their work and I felt it a privilege to spend three short nights there. I hope to return before too long. </DOC> Stylishly elegant old world hotel Beautifuly kept ,and sumptuosly furnished I paid 200 aud per night. Three nice restaurants but expensive Drinks over the top really the only downside Tip...stock the pool bar .....palin silly staff wandering to inside bar to get a bourbon and coke </DOC> We had been out with business lunch with associates from abroad. Hotel sports a beautiful Indian legacy pictorially. Staff is courteous and attentive. Indian food was very delicious and sumptuous. Ambience, the air quality, the greens all had very salubrious effect. It was my second visit and excellent as usual. </DOC> Our first visit to India, and after the initial shock of traffic chaos from the airport, beeping horns, dreadful driving etc, we were whisked into the lovely gardens of this impressive hotel. We were warmly received, and after tea and home baked cookies, were given a full tour of the hotel's facilities, before being shown to our comfortable room. The hotel evokes the era of the Raj, and the walls are festooned with interesting old photos. Excellent restaurants, catering for all tastes, and a lovely bakery/ patisserie. Can highly recommend the Spice Route restaurant, great atmosphere and food. A memorable stay, and highly recommended. </DOC> Pretty much everything that needs to be said has been said in other reviews. Lovely property. Faultless service. Excellent food. Convenient for Connaught Place. Pricey (very,by local standards) but worth it. </DOC> This is one of the 3 hotels (Leela Palace, Imperial and Shangri-la) I stay in Delhi. I have written many positive and negative comments about Imperial in the past. This time I was very impressed by the overall stay here. The room and food quality was excellent. The entire team of staff were courteous and very cooperative. I would like to make a special mention of Mr. Mukesh, the chauffeur who received me at the airport.

We discovered four inhouse restaurants, but failed to find number five....breakfast was too little honour for what we experienced....what a beautiful place! </DOC> Beautiful building. Excellent service. Lovely leisure facilities. However, I felt the pictures on walls and decor in public areas a little too much - perhaps just reduce ? In comparison, the Taj Palace Mumbai gets things better. But overall wonderful stay. </DOC> It certainly ranks in Conde Naste top ten and I certainly would not disagree. every aspect of the hotel oozes luxury, nothing is left undone. The building is one of Lutyens many master pieces. it also houses the Restaurant \" the spice Route\" again rated among the worlds best and I would again be slow to disagree. However we equally found that food elsewhere in the hotel was also extremely good so you really cannot go wrong. From your very first minute of arriving you know you are in the very best of hands and it continues to the minute you leave. The rooms were superb with masses of space good air con and lovely bathrooms. I cannot recommend it too highly! Criticisms, if luxury and faultless service can be too much, then you will find it here. this is a jest of course </DOC> We stayed here twice, the first time for two nights in a suite, the second for one night in a heritage room. Both rooms were excellent well maintained and with everything we needed. Loved the location near Janpath metro which made exploring a breeze. Only criticism was breakfast which was the worse selection of anywhere in our trip and the breakfast room was not being well cleared or maintained to cope with the breakfast visitors on the days we ate there.",

It's very grand and palatial like many hotels in India.the service was excellent and in the foyer it has a huge Chanel shop if you like those sort of things.like most of the large chains in India you have to pay for the wi fi which is annying. We purchased a 10gb data card for a spare phone at the airport and it worked fine and we used it as a hotspot for all our devices which is worth doing. We dined at the Thi restaurant which is billed as one of the worlds best restaurants and we were not disappointed. I would certainly recommend this hotel. </DOC> We very much enjoyed our stay in this very beautiful hotel. The room was lovely with fine furnishings and the entire hotel is interesting with art and history throughout. The staff was very accommodating. </DOC> from the place itself to the decor, to the service, a real fabulous experience. could not recommend enough , a real treat ! thank you . not to mention the spice route restaurant! if back in dehli, no doubt where to stay </DOC> A wonderfully preserved colonial property in the heart of Delhi. Service is excellent, as is the decor and food. Their bar, the patiala 69 has some wonderful cocktails, especially their signature cocktail section. The hotel has a large collection of colonial medals and other memorabilia like a signed photograph of King George V and queen Mary, a pair of mirrors gifted by them on their india visit, photographs etc. Rooms are nice. </DOC> we stayed here for a couple of nights in February 2018. We loved it. The atmosphere is akin the days of the Raj, presumably deliberately. The architecture echoes the 1930s. the food is great. the service is impeccable. </DOC> Our first visit to New Delhi and our Agent recommended the Imperial. Very pleased she did. A hotel of historical importance, with much evidence on display. A standard room at the rear overlooking the gardens. A good size room and bathroom. The buffet breakfast, spoilt for choice. The Italian restaurant ideal for a non Indian meal for those of us who do not eat Indian! Some may find it a little too formal. My one grip about many of the hotels in India is charging for the internet. Needs to provide at least one hour free access.",

This is a beautiful luxury hotel. The lobby and entrance are fabulous and elegantly decorated and the staff is outfitted in traditional dress. We enjoyed our best meal in New Delhi at the fantastic Bukhara restaurant, bought lovely cashmere scarves and chocolate at the lobby boutiques, and browsed the other boutiques including clothing and fine jewellery. Our room was huge and very modern with lovely amenities, and room service was efficient and served with a smile. The hotel is located in the Diplomatic Enclave where most Embassies are located, and the area is green and well kept and seemed very safe to walk around. </DOC> Stayed at this prestigious hotel almost after 2 decades and the experience is a bit of a let down ! Even more so as i my family joined me and we stayed here immediately after a week'a stay at Ritz Carlton Bangalore which perhaps is one of the best hotels in the country ! So the contrast between these two hotel hits you immediately !! The infra structure is a bit run down ! Service is a bit lethargic ! You have to call the concierge for to get the newspaper of your choice ! Even after registering your favourite newspaper they give you a different paper every day ! Though I stayed in a superior / executive room the bathroom was disproportionately small ! Taking bath was a real struggle ! Food was Nair about ok ! We are only at the coffee shop ! I think the hotel needs a major revamp it wants to live upto its </DOC> Still the best. Great staff and great care of each guest. Polite crisp and made to order. Luxury Collection at its best. The place to stay in delhi. World best restaurants add another feather to the already crowded crown. </DOC> I always enjoy coming to this property - firstly because of the warm welcome - their customer recognition is just amazing.The rooms are spacious and the staff are extremely courteous and helpful -- it really is service at its best.- food is outstanding. </DOC> I stayed here during a business visit recently. as all ITC hotels, an excellent place to stay with with some signature outlets to down your hunger. The bar has happy hours with some nice music - hence can unwind. the rooms are spacious and so is the bath. food is excellent as usual....the service is excellent. the only let down was the Spa...not managed by professionals always...and the service quality can improve a bit. I have visited many of their Spas (Kaya Kalp), found all to be excellent so why not this? </DOC> I stayed at the ITC for approximately one week. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and encourage you to consider this for your visit too. I especially enjoyed: + helpfulness of the staff, especially to help us prepare for an Indian wedding + Bukhara restaurant was amazing + Pool area was fun and great for the hot heat + location is a short walk around from some nice places and other hotels </DOC> I stayed for a night on May 26th , 2017. The Front office person was not knowing about the room's view! He consulted his senior and replied that it was facing the city side. He did not explain what were the facilities and benefits ( about happy hours, discounts in spa coffee lounge etc., ) given to the Executive Club room guests. I found the service not up to mark and definitely not expected from ITCs flagship hotel!",

Great architecture, many great options for food and shopping, rooms that are very appealing. The location also is a big plus in one of the best neighborhoods of New Delhi. The staff is also very friendly and helpful. </DOC> Well appointed room if a little on the small side. Comfortable bed. Charming attentive staff who are a credit to the hotel. Room service was excellent, tasty food served quickly. Breakfast was delicious. Will definitely stay here again. </DOC> I used to travel extesively in India and stayed at this hotel a lot in the eighties and nineties. Returned in november 2017 and found it excellent ! I had a club room which was spacious and worked absolutely to expectations, and the happy hour concept, which worked in two dedicated lounges and a public bar, was marvellous. The catering was a bit skimpy, maybe, but drinks were plentiful. The public bar alternative was especially fine. Great place and no qualms about returning another time. </DOC> Heavy security on arrival is reassuring. Very slow check in process. Staff all very helpful and friendly. Upgraded which is a great start. Room is great, spacious comfortable and spotlessly clean. Plenty of free water. Restaurant choices on site are good and pretty reasonable in price. Breakfast has good choices and good food. This is a good hotel. The check out process is as slow as the check in and this is the only thing that stops me rating it a five. I would recommend this hotel. </DOC> ITC hotel is a bit far from Indra Gandi internarional airport.I find the hotel pretty much artistic unlike any other hotels I been too.I love the colourful paint on the cielling at the reception.I find my room clean and nit.I find the hotel personnel profesional and honest.I gave my clothes to laudry personnels.I was given the money I foget on my pocket.I was so impressed by the Laundry man NAV KUMAR for his professionalism.I remeber back in the days when in Milano Sheraton hotel at MXP airport.Me and my friends used to loss money from our room mysteriously.And yet the hotel manegers and police refuse to tell us why its disappear just like that. </DOC> Itc Maurya is the magnificent property with grand interiors. Excellent food and taste the signature dishes like dumpukht biryani and dal bhukara. Lovely staff and always humble. Itc one category rooms are excellent. Stay here for lovely food. Godspeed.",

We walked around before dinner and there are many places to shop, eat, or drink. We didn\u2019t stay there but I\u2019m sure it would have been excellent. </DOC> It cannot get better than this. ITC Maurya is the epitome of luxury and excellence. Everything is so perfect here. The care and attention extended by the hotel staff is truly exemplary. Highly recommended for those who are looking for the \"best\" !!! </DOC> Though the rooms may be a bit dated or worn, the service is spectacular! We were traveling with small children and had adjoining rooms. They didn\u2019t realize this and couldn\u2019t accommodate us initially but by the second night they switched us to beautiful adjoining rooms in the residential tower and provided us with a complimentary massage for our troubles (Tanya was a lovely masseuse). A big thank you to Ms Mani Raheja at the front desk. She also endured that our future ITC hotels on this trip would have adjoining suites. </DOC> This was a beautiful hotel....we went to the rooftop...and I was expecting a \"typical hotel brunch\" with all that food that has been sitting on the buffet forever. THIS WAS NOT THE CASE. This brunch was the best. Lamb chops....pizzas....prawns....mozarella bar....champagne....maybe because it was Easter...not sure...but it was absolutely delightful! </DOC> A hotel with a reputation as the preferred residence for many heads of state, ITC Maurya offers you the standard trappings - nice location, greenery, excellent restaurants, warm hospitality et al. Nevertheless, for a hotel of its stature, a couple of fixes (ensuring the room is less \u201ccrowded\u201d and a relook at its upgrade policy, given the offerings from its peers) can round off the wow factor. </DOC> Stayed here for one night on business. I was told the room would be available at 12pm. However when I went to check in at 3:30 pm, after 20min with the receptionist running all over, I was told that the room is not ready. When I told him that I have arrived post hotel check in time, the room was given within a minute. Can't understand why you wouldn't give a room when it's available! The rooms are nice and well appointed. Decent gym. Room service was prompt and delicious. Breakfast spread is really good and so is the quality. Check out was slow too. </DOC> Self contained hotel with large garden at rear. Pool is nice as are the restaurants located within the hotel. Rooms are large and comfortable with our case a view of the front of the hotel. Staff helpful and looking to please. </DOC> I arrived in India and check into the Maurya Hotel for the beginning of a week long trip with the amazing non profit group PATH based in Seattle. This hotel was in the diplomatic area so not easy to wander outside the gates. The hotel has wonderful restaurants and was willing to help with a local guide for a half day tour.

We were served with first class attention wherever we went in the hotel. In the Pavilion is 24 hour restaurant we were served by Sharad Amit and Charan who were excellent. ITC rarely lets you down! </DOC> Our experience with ITC brand hotels have been very good and ITC Maury\u2019s is no exception. Very courteous staff and management. My wife had fever and was not feeling well and the staff took great care. </DOC> Happened to have some business colleagues staying in the Maurya so I went over and the wanted to eat in the worlds number one restaurant Bukhara, booked weeks in advance. Luckily an old friend Mr Arun Kaul who moved to the hotel recently took my call and low and behold a table for 5 magically appeared. Thank you ARIN, thank you Maurya but most of all Thankyou the amazing stall of Bukhara. </DOC> Everything on the hotel site - room, lobby, restaurants, decorations - are up to five star standards but I found the service a bit poor for the surroundings. Check in was very complicated and took long time, same with the check out. Also it took a long time to get the luggage down to my car when leaving. Front desk service was also impersonal and I did not feel welcome. I know this might be just incidental but when I compare to my great and friendly experience at Oberoi it makes a difference. On the positive side Bukahara was a great experience and excellent food, try the lamb. </DOC> We stayed 2 nights at the ITC Maurya at the start and end of our trip in India. The hotel is a piece of quiet in a busy city. The room was very comfortable. The breakfast was excellent. The only downside is that they forgot to offer the platinum benefits during our visit and we were not in a position to enjoy the free drinks. They should be really more careful when hosting premium Marriott club members. Otherwise an excellent hotel </DOC> This is my favorite luxury hotel in India. On arrival I was met by Arun Kaul the front desk manager who one day will surely have a luxury hotel under his management. He seamlessly registered me escorted me to my room and ensured that I was happy. I have watched his career progress and trust me he will be a super star in the ITC system. He ensured that I was well looked after and arranged a car for me, my airline tickets and dinner reservations, this is service. So if you are coming to the Maurya please remember service is their hallmark. </DOC> This hotel is an old favourite and has been maintained immaculately despite its age. Superb service by all staff, especially from the very efficient guest relations executives. Great rooms. I requested a change from a smoking room and I was immediately upgraded to a junior suite. Fantastic breakfast. Keep up the good work! </DOC> I stayed here for 1 night, got a bigger room as ITC member. Room had study, and sofa sit out other than bed. The ipad controls all lights. Toiletries were rich esp. shampoo, conditioner. Had 3 fruits and brownie as welcome. Rich coffee and tea for us. The room also had tips on ensuring refreshing sleep and some perfumes to help that. Best part was dlecta milke sachets; tea tastes best with milk (instead of powder). Thank you, ITC! The hotel offers paid wi-fi; only breakfast is included.",

        "docs": "Located in the Diplomatic enclave of New Delhi, you get green verdant views of the city when you look out of the windows of the hotel. 30 odd minutes from the airport and the city centre, with five star facilities, this place lives to the mark of Taj group of Hotel's standards. I have seen a few reviews of this hotel which say the rooms and the property being jaded. Let me tell you the truth. Yes this is a very old hotel. But they are constantly renovating and have renovated and up-kept the hotel to good standards. The service is excellent, so is the food. The ambiance is five star and the pricing reasonable. For around 180 USD if you get a double accommodation in a capital city of India, your dollar is fetching you far. I would recommend this hotel to everyone who needs to stay. </DOC> This hotel must be one of the best in the world. It is the only time when I did not even have to check in, but was brought to the room immediately, where check-in was conducted. The room was invitingly decorated, had a spotless bathroom and solid wifi. The lounge is very pleasant and breakfast, top notch. The real astonishing characteristic was the service, which was world class. The hotel also houses a few excellent restaurants. Very much recommended and I'd myself return anytime. </DOC> We stayed 3 times during our visit to New Delhi here, and weren't disappointed at all. The restaurant buffet is excellent with a choice of Indian and European foods. In fact the chef specailly prepared meal for me each time, as I cannot tolerate spices. The rooms are very comfortable with memory mattresses and pillows. The room was quiet and spacious also. The staff were attentive and very helpful. I would highly recomment this hotel. </DOC> Our excellent stay started with the superb welcome and continued throughput. Lovely spacious room although the bathroom was the standard \u201cold\u201d 6 sqm. It was well appointed though with good amenities. A hand held shower and separate shower stall would be expected in a hotel of this class but difficult to do that now. The mattress in our room needed turning but none of this spoiled a great stay. The wonderful staff are the greatest attribute of this impressive hotel. Highly recommended! </DOC> As the name suggests, its purely Taj. Staff is awesome, Rooms are nice, the entire hotel is neat & clean. One thing the manager has to see that the mini bar has to b checked in the presence of the guest as I was being charged for 2 beers i never took from the bar and had brought my own. </DOC> We stayed here for two nights in March. We were upgraded to a suite that was luxurious. The bathroom was spectacular, having a rainforest shower as well as a two person marble tub. The king bed was very comfortable. The staff from the front desk to the waiters were to a person professional but also genuinely warm. The facilities such as the fitness room were spacious and well-furnished. We had drinks outside on the terrace of the Blue Bar, which was very relaxing. The drink and wine list was extensive. We ate dinner in the Indian restaurant on the premises one evening and the food was enjoyable. The buffet breakfast had everything one could ask for; the selections were mind-boggling actually. This is a true 5-star hotel. We would return. </DOC> We arrived early for checking in and were given a room straight away on the top floor over looking the pool and gardens which was appreciated. The staff throughout our stay from the driver at the airport to the check in staff, the porters, waiters ,bar staff, cleaners and poolside attendant are all extremely friendly and attentive which made our stay so enjoyable. The Blue Bar does really nice cocktails and has a happy hour which is great value. The lunchtime buffet in what doubles as the breakfast room is exceptional in terms of the range of choice and presentation again complimented by friendly and attentive staff. The breakfast choice and service is comparable. There is no need uncatered for here in beautiful surroundings that are maintained by a large team of employees all with an aim to please. Excellent all round indulgence! </DOC> It is not the first time I stay at this excellent hotel. A resort of sanity in hectic New Delhi. Simply, this is one of the best hotels I\u2019ve ever visited, and definitely the best I stayed in at Delhi. The staff is great, polite and welcoming, truly trying to assist, help and guide.

After many years I stayed here and it kind of takes you back to the old world charm of Delhi both with its Decor and with its hospitality. The staff is extremely professional. The checking in was personalized with a host receiving me at the car and escorting me to the room and taking all the details at the room, saving some precious time. Had dinner at Spicy duck which was nice. Really enjoyed the breakfast that was made fresh in the open kitchen. Would go back any day as and when Delhi calls back. </DOC> I had booked the Taj Luxury Room as it comes with one-way complimentary airport transfer. However I was surprised that I was upgraded to their Suite - it was my first time staying at Taj Delhi. The room was great, very spacious with a comfortable bed and faces the pool. The bathroom is very spacious too with 2 wash up area. Breakfast was great - love their Masala Thosai. Similarly, the butter chicken that I had for lunch was awesome as well! Unfortunately I was there for meetings and thus did not get to spend some time at their Club Floor. The hotel is rather near to the airport, around 20mins in the early morning before the traffic kicks in. Otherwise do plan at least an hour of travel time to the airport. </DOC> Your stay will never go wrong when you stay at the Taj. Right from check in you can realise the professional service they have. They were very kind enough to upgrade me to the next level. The room service was quick even during peak hours. the breakfast had a large variety and excellent staff to take care. Special thanks to Mr. Karan Maini for making my stay even more special. </DOC> I have stayed at all of the top New Delhi hotels at one time or another. The Taj Palace is the best. This is a true five star hotel. The rooms are fine (not as large as what one finds in top American and Asian hotels, but plenty good enough). What I like best about the Taj Palace is the restaurant selection and quality. Breakfast is outstanding -- great selection, top level service. I just wish the restaurant opened a bit earlier (hot food not available until 7am, cold food 30 minutes earlier). For dinner, one has a selection of Indian, Chinese and European cuisines -- all three truly five star. The Orient Express (European food) is as good as one will find anywhere in the world -- six stars! </DOC> Good service. Decent enough rooms. Comfy beds. Good showers. Breakfast spread had a good selection. I had a good comfortable business trip stay here for one night. Nothing to complain about, nothing to write home about. </DOC> This is no doubt one of the best hotels in New Delhi's Diplomatic Enclave that apparently attracts politicians, officials and 'so-called' celebrities . Everything is luxurious and it is good to find very well controlled air conditioning. They hotel grounds and pool are most attractive and the staff are obviously well trained. They do need proper towel rails in the bathroom. Breakfasts and buffet dinners were very good. They are rather paranoid regarding photography, not permitting photography in the foyer/reception area or of the hotel entrance. </DOC> I've stayed in quite a few of the Taj hotels in India, from Srinagar to Cochin. They're all great but this is my favourite. Perhaps it's the slightly newer property, still combined with the grand decor and faultless service. Checking in was a breeze, they had all my details while still queuing. Room was superb, nice view and along with the Taj styling, lots of thoughtful touches, especially on lighting. Breakfast is in a great room overlooking the garden. Huge spread covering all types of cuisine. Gym is good, decent range of up to date equipment. The service always makes the difference for me - cleaning some mucky running shoes overnight and also some pressing, all delivered on the dot. I'll certainly be back. </DOC> Stayed here for the third or fourth time now. Excellent service and very comfortable rooms. No complaints whatsoever. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The Blue Bar is a must visit Bar / Lounge especially on the weekends. Highly recommended.",

Thoroughly recommended, would return here without hesitation. </DOC> Pros - Pay US$10 extra for an upgrade - Experience the Orient Express- its a MUST!! One of the best restaurant in terms of food and service. - Hiring a hotel car with driver to visit the shops was reasonably priced for the high quality of service it was offering. - Beautiful hotel and excellent service Cons: - Got the concierge to order us an air-conditioned radio taxi. Ended up being a disguising stinking yellow taxi from outside the hotel. Lucky the airport is only a short ride way. - Trainee staff are very amateur. They need more training and probably don't put them in front line of service until they are more trained. - Aging pool </DOC> Whilst travelling around the Indian Golden Trangle we stayed at Taj three times and each time excellent rooms, service, meals and facilities. Unfortunately nor enough to enjoy the swimming pool. Lots of staff and tough security for this excellent hotel. Most enjoyable </DOC> Normally one does not stay in a Hotel in a city of your residence. I spent two nights at the property and found it to be absolutely top class in every which way. The suite was well appointed and every comfort catered for. The breakfast is excellent and so are the other services including housekeeping. </DOC> International standard hotel, excellent service. Our visit coincided with the Coaltrans 2017 conference which meant that we couldn't get into the Orient Express restaurant. It also meant that the lobby and reception areas were a zoo for a couple of days as lots of guys stood around networking something which I doubt would be allowed in a Western Hotel of this class. The menu at the Spicy Duck Chinese restaurant featured far more dishes with chilli than we encountered in China - obviously an adjustment to local taste. </DOC> Does what it says on the tin- decent service, decent food etc. BUt needs a refurb. Fitness centre and weights room needs work, looking tired. Pool is nice though as is the restaraunt patio area. Its in a posh part of town, but I thought maybe being nearer Saket would have made more sense. Even the spa needs a bit of work- its on the ground floor in a rather dingy bit of the hotel. So overall- ok for a business trip (I was there for a wedding and business trip)- but nothing special. Perhaps the best part was the car and driver I hired from the hotel- driver very pleasant chap and helpful. </DOC> the local food was top notch I had an invitation to come and eat in Taj Palece was an extraordinary experience service highest degree hospitality in capital letters was fantastic was a treat to experience this luxury </DOC> All the Taj properties we have stayed in have been superb and this was no exception. We only stayed one night ahead of our flight home - getting there was pretty horendous due to traffic but transfer to the airport at 7am was no problem. I think it would be a good location if staying in Delhi a few days. Room was terrific and service excellent. Unfortunately we could not get a table in the Indian restaurant so I would suggest booking well ahead. Breakfast was great.",

Food of the hotel is excellent. They have wide range in their buffet breakfast and tastes good. They have a very nice fitness centre and spa. Overall a very nice stay. </DOC> The Taj Palace hotel in the capital of India makes India proud. A beautiful gem right in the heart of the city. The rooms are superbly done and have a sense of luxury, style and comfort. The furnishing and ammenities in the room are beautiful and yet very contemporary. The restaurants are fantastic and the service is extremely efficient. The breakfast spread is vast and the selection is very good and fairly international. Can't wait to go back. </DOC> had stay in this hotel on 1st of may.. Its good hotel... check-in was fast ...Staff is very polite... Breakfast rate is quite high...room was on 4th floor..view from room was good... but not pool view.. over all good </DOC> The hotel is located in the diplomatic and claim off New Delhi. The hotel is a heritage property with a grande Decor Stayed for two nights On a business visit The breakfast was very lavish and had a lot of choices of different cuisines with good service The staff very friendly and courteous Over all A very good hotel in New delhi </DOC> this hotel is amazing, it is beautiful, charming, and incredibly well staffed. I stayed here for 2 nights after a work trip to see more of Delhi and couldn't be happier with my choice. This place is amazing. Pros: Very clean Very wonderful staff, super friendly very gorgeous property, meticulously kept grounds. great food and great selection Cons: The only two I have is the bed was one of the hardest I have ever slept on anywhere. and it still uses old style digital keys, I think they are upgrading, but I had the old one, I hate carrying a physical key around, but really that is just a trivial complaint. Would I stay here again? absolutely. this hotel was in a great area of Delhi to be able to tour around, the staff was great, the food was great, overall a wonderful experience from start to end. </DOC> As a devotee of the Taj Hotels my recent stay at the Taj Palace did not disappoint. I booked into a Club Room and staff from entry to leaving the hotel were immensely helpful. I had a few problems with the key card but these were remedied quickly and efficiently. The room was of a very high standard with all the facilities that you would require. The Club Lounge was busy but a pleasant place to have a drink ion /the evening. The weather was very hot during my stay and hence the swimming pool featured large - here too the pool staff were very helpful and provided chilled bottled water as required. One of the highlights was dining at the Orient Express restaurant - see separate review. </DOC> This is more like a business class hotel but with excellent services. The hotel is too busy but still check in check out did not take much time. We were upgraded to the deluxe room which was nice and comfortable. The breakfast spread is good with lots of variety for all and would be liked by all breakfast lovers. The pool is ok ok. Nothing much fancy. NO kids pool. The Spa looked wonderful although we didnt get a chance to use it. If travelling with kids and looking for hotel that has kids activities too then this should be avoided.",

        "docs": "This was the second time that I stayed at this hotel. I've been here once before for a conference, and now for a business trip. The hotel is convenient for my business. The room was satisfactory, standard Hilton hotel. I had breakfast in the restaurant, and that was fine. If I was here as a tourist, I'm not sure I would pick this hotel - the area didn't have a touristy vibe. Because the hotel hosts conferences, it can feel like a bus station and there wasn't any real ambiance. As a business traveler, I don't really mind, so would return here on a business trip. </DOC> I stayed here on a large group business visit attending a conference. In general I found the staff friendly, although the Concierge needed a bit of a shake up! Rooms and bathrooms are ok, a little bit basic but comfortable bed. Restaurant was better than you would normally expect. It\u2019s not a top hotel in BA but more than satisfying if on a budget Good location !! </DOC> What a fantastic Hotel! We were looked after incredibly well by all the staff but in particular we have to mention florencia on the front desk and Veronica in the executive lounge. The hotel is positioned in an enviable place and the room had a fantastic view over modern Buenos Aires which is Puerto Madero. The gym was exceptional with every machine you could think of and the hotel also has a pool which I believe to be seasonal. Breakfast was a highlight and the attentiveness and service from the staff there was a joy to behold. A very good hotel. </DOC> Came to this hotel for an international congress. It is nicely located in Puerto Madero, the chic neighborhood of Buenos Aires. Good things: Staff is very nice, the room was perfect, clean. Breakfast is good, although they offered a dedicated space for breakfast of the participants of my congress and the offer was different (in the bad sense) than the \"normal\" breakfast. Bad things: Internet is a shame, even with the Hilton Honors access. The air conditioning is quite noisy. In my bathroom (that by the way is great), the floor was uneven so during my showers I was all the time avoiding the flooding. </DOC> Welcoming personal speaking even French and happy to practice. Big clean rooms with huge bathroom. Cleaning personal is friendly. Nice bar with original cocktail ideas. Hotel architecture is original and is worth to watch from the seventh floor. </DOC> I stayed here last year too and would say they have managed to keep up the same high standards of service and quality even now. Although some of the shower fittings are starting to look old, the room itself is very well maintained and the staff are very helpful. When you are in Argentina, language is definitely and issue if you don\u2019t speak Spanish. Compared to last year though, their guest services have improved in their English proficiency. Food is good, however room service is a limited menu and hasn\u2019t changed at all in a year. </DOC> Great Hotel.... As a Gold Hilton member i was put on the top 2 floors, which are just for gold members etc. Great views from here, lovely lounge, which has separate access to the pool area. I think this is a great hotel, lovely food, good service. Rooms are great, comfy beds and good shower facilites etc. The Gym is also very good! Definitely stay here for business or even pleasure. </DOC> We can only corroborate other reviewers who agree that this is a beautiful hotel with a very clean look and large rooms that easily can give you the feeling of being back in the US. Many upscale restaurants and Argentine fast food in the area if you choose not to eat in the hotel. The area is well lit and you can safely walk along the waterway by some great Argentine restaurants that offer a variety of foods. A feeling of home in a foreign country.",

The food was not bad for breakfast and the cocktails and food in the afternoon was also fine. The front desk people are great. The ATM in the lobby was a good way to get local currency. There are chain restaurants near by if you want (Burger King, TGIFridays). We ate at local places away from the hotel to taste the great steaks and other Argentinian foods. You can walk into some of the busy parts of Buenos Aires in about 15 minutes. Had no problem walking around at night near the hotel. Would go back again. </DOC> The hotel is situated in an outstanding location (probably the safest tourist area) within short walk of several nice restaurants and bars. The property has a superior executive lounge offering a very nice breakfast and daily appetizers with cocktails in the evening. Friendly helpful staff throughout the hotel. Overall a great property in a great location!! </DOC> I stayed at this Hilton many times before (there is another evaluation I did dating from 2012). Continue to be excellent in service, cleanness. The food is good, but not great (but there are many many options around). A good place to stay </DOC> had the pleasure to experience the executive 9th floor during construction! thank you for that. the difference is the lounge and the peace and quite of the 9th floor. i didn't see much difference to the rooms on the 1st floor. maybe the keep-up is a bit better , but the room is as convenient as my latter. beds are very compfy and the bathroom spacious. you need to change the deskchairs in the whole hotel because i had a damaged one once again , which were replaced immediately after i called guestservices. breakfast in the lounge was more than sufficient, cereal, eggs & bacon , coldcuts , cheese and bread plus croissant and toast ! i was quite surprised! ( promised was a \"continental breakfast) all in all a great layover! thank you very much! </DOC> My wife and I stayed for one night on the club floor. All of the people we dealt with from bellman, front desk, housekeeping and restaurant staff were excellent in every way. The check in clerk suggests a better room as my wife wanted some views of the city. The room was spacious, comfortable and clean. There was even an adapter for North American plugs in the room. The food in the club lounge was excellent both in the evening and for breakfast. I highly recommend this hotel. It will be our first choice the next time we are in Buenos Aires. </DOC> We are on the Executive Club level on the 8th floor. Our suite is gorgeous and the club room is large with many windows overlooking the hotel pool. The spread at 6:00 was filling and no need to dine out tonight! Malbec is so good. What a great first impression of the city. Lobby is beautifully decorated for Christmas in an enormous atrium. </DOC> Five of us arrived very early (around 10:30am) from EZE to spend the night before leaving on a cruise, and only one of our rooms was not yet ready. However we had connecting rooms, so this was no problem. The hotel is beautiful! Rooms are large, wonderful amenities and every single one of the hotel personnel we encountered was absolutely excellent. The hotel is located in a lovely area, safe for walking, and close to numerous bars and restaurants. We had booked the hotel's shuttle ahead of time, and our driver waited patiently for us to clear customs and begin his long drive from the airport to the Puerto Madero district. I am only a Gold Hilton member, yet we were treated like royalty. Perfect location for travelers leaving on a cruise, as the taxi fare to the cruise port was only $10. I cannot recommend this beautiful Hilton enough! </DOC> Very modern and stylish with lovely rooms and generally good service. Wi fi is free and fast. The atrium is a great place for a drink or lunch, although when we were there it was too hot. The temperature outside was well over 35C and the sun was shining through the glass roof. There was no shade. There is a delightful self-serve coffee shop (Croutons) selling soft drinks and snacks that you could eat there or take away. The service here was helpful, exceptionally friendly and cheerful. The concierge was exceptionally helpful. We ate breakfast and one dinner in the El Faro restaurant \u2013 see separate review.",

Walking distance to a lot of attractions. The Concierges desk was extremely helpful with directions and tours. They had a Spa, but we didn't check it out. Right outside the hotel in a little park area that was a mini workout area. We enjoyed using that area after a long walk. </DOC> if you want a room that hasn't been cleaned, awful maintenace, staff that ignore your requests, then this is the place for you. Too bad because the location is great and the room sizes are very good and the club lounge staff do a nice job at cocktail time. </DOC> It is always a pleasure to return to this lovely hotel where the staff are so pleasant. I was fortunate to have a very lovely room on the Exec Club floor with a great view of the fireworks--thank you Francisco. I still have issues with the quality and choice of food in the Exec Lounge--it is way below the levels internationally i am used to and F/B Dir should look at this.. In past reviews i have also highlighted this issue. How i wish a proper line system was created outside the hotel for taxis as we are used to in Europe. The hotel truly looks wonderful at lobby level -- next an investment in bed linen--some sheets are very old and grey!! I look forward to returning and strongly recommend. </DOC> Nothing not to like, the hotel is spectacular, one of the nicest Hiltons I have ever stayed in. The location is ideal, 5 minutes walk to the docklands area where they are great walks and heaps of restaurants. The rooms are big and well appointed. I will definitely stay here again if I return to BA. The only issue I had is that the AC sound is quite loud, so I couldn't sleep, but turning it off made the room quite hot. </DOC> We stayed here for two nights on our first visit to Buenos Aires. Right from the welcome when we checked in we felt the staff wanted you to be there. Receptionist, Concierge staff, bar staff, health centre everyone was very friendly and welcoming. We had booked room with breakfast and the breakfast selection was excellent, great range of foods. Rooms were nice and big and clean. We enjoyed the skills of Alex in the bar who mixed me a variation based on The Botanist Gin which was to die for. Shan\u2019t tell you what it was so Alex can keep his secrets. </DOC> This was a great value for a five star hotel. The service and rooms was wonderful and this is located in a new and safe part of the city. Lots of dining and entertainment that you can walk to. We would stay here again. </DOC> We spent one night at this hotel after a long flight and travel delays. While not large, the room was comfortable and the bed inviting. Room service was quite good. The hotel staff was professional, courteous and helpful. The hotel was undergoing renovations at the time and we appreciated being notified a couple weeks before our arrival of this fact and the discount so offered. It is a little difficult to give a more detailed review given our one night there while renovations to the lobby were underway. For a one night stay, we thoroughly enjoyed this hotel. </DOC> After a long international flight, it was nice to stay at this property. I enjoyed the rooftop pool and a massage-both great for getting over jet leg. However, my room was a bit beaten up and worn, although it was spacious. The service was also a bit slow.",

I would say it is understated elegance. The hotel is very proud of their heritage. We enjoyed looking at the historic photos that line the walls of the public areas. The grounds are meticulously maintained and the staff was outstanding. Very nicely equipped gym, lots of free weights. Really comfortable bed. We would certainly stay here again. </DOC> What a wonderful experience. Classic Frank Lloyd Wright style maintained throughout the hotel and the grounds. The rooms were updated and were spacious and comfortable. The service throughout the resort was superior and friendly. Lovely grounds with very nice earring facilities. </DOC> This is one of those very special places, where the service, the location, the architecture, all come together. My experience was memorable and first rate. The room was gorgeous, the bed super-comfortable, the food excellent. I was here for a conference, but I'd be happy to come on my own. Hotels don't get much better. </DOC> PROS: Very nice hotel with a sprawling campus. The brunch was awesome and highly recommended. Terrific service by the hotel staff which were very friendly. CONS: The main pool had blaring music, almost like a club. There are other pools, but in the afternoon the main pool turned into a club with no available chairs. The golf course is not part of the hotel. There was no service to take your golf bags 1000' feet across the street. The staff did not know about the amenities of the golf course. You can walk or drive across the street to play one of the two courses which are very nice. I thought this hotel was going to be relaxing and a golf resort. </DOC> The Arizona Biltmore is truly a unique historical property. It is great to see that property management and ownership is making sure that maintenance is done. In just looking at the place one would never think that it was built such a long time ago. The main buildings and restaurant are beautiful; and the grounds, fruit trees, and gardens are worth the time it would take to walk around the entire property. The only thing that really surprised me was a daily charge for maid and bell boy tipping. I would think those should be part of the daily rate and not forced upon clients. </DOC> I had the opportunity to stay here for a business meeting in January. I was in room 2305 in the Paradise Wing. The room was beautiful, staff was great and good during our stay was outstanding. Be sure to get out and explore the property a bit as the buildings are all unique. We played golf at the attached course and had a nice time. We will definitely consider this property again. </DOC> Had a top floor cottage room which featured a separate sitting area and large bathroom. Room was clean, although one day room was not cleaned by 5 pm. You can hear music if events are on the Squaw Peak Lawn. Fire pits are beautiful. Conference food and snacks were very good. Love the history and the beautiful architecture. </DOC> We recently stayed here for 3 nights. We were in a nice sized room, but it faced the mountains in the back and was always \"dark\". I would ask for a room with a view of the grounds, since the grounds are well maintained and lovely. The room also felt like it should have an update. We had room service one night, and the food was excellent and it came quickly. The bar wine drinks were on the high side. You have to ask for the candied nuts that they serve with the drinks (they were really good). The main pool area was nice and they have a seating area for a light lunch, which was pretty good (service so so). Most of the staff were very friendly and helpful.",

It was a nice event, part of our annual tradition to try new places for tea. It is not cheap -- we had several kinds of tea, many sandwiches and finger foods, many desserts, and champagne. With tax and tip it was $75.00 per person. Christopher Ray was our charming and helpful host. My only complaint is that I felt they should have cleared the plates between courses. </DOC> I stayed here with my wife and grandson for two nights. Our room was not ready when we checked in, so the upgraded us to a much nicer room! Very classy. The place was very well maintained, and the architecture is quite unique. The only thing I did not like is that the self park was very far away, and hard to find. Otherwise, we did not have any complaints. </DOC> While the Arizona Biltmore has become a mainstay for corporate conferences, the hotel remains a relaxing, indulgent location for tourists too. During our recent two-part stay, we particularly enjoyed our king room in the Terrace Wing, where we enjoyed a full suite with two patio areas. The room was spacious, well appointed, and nicely planned, and the resort itself is an pleasure from top to bottom, with Frank Lloyd Wright\u2013inspired architecture and design elements throughout. Our return stay, in the Paradise wing was a standard guest room but again had a lovely view and a comfortable bed. The bellhop and room-service staff were particularly good as well, with extremely kind, helpful service for both us and our parents. We definitely look forward to more visits in the future! </DOC> This was my third stay at this property and I can report that things have improved. The staff was pleasant and helpful, the room was clean and quiet, and the grounds were much better maintained. On my last visit several of the outdoor games (Chess/Bag Toss) were broken or run down. This time everything was fixed and fine. My only caveat is that I was shocked to see that I was charged for maid and other gratuities and ticky-tack services that I either did not receive or had addressed separately. However, the charges totaled less than $20, so I did not complain. Just be sure you check your bill when you check-out. </DOC> From start to finish, great first class experience. Service, rooms and facilities great. The Bar staff including Tatum and her whole crew made me feel like family. Thank you. The valet guys were the nicest, friendliest and most accommodating too.Was there for 8 nights. </DOC> I try to stay at the resort when I am in town for work. Staff is always help and kind. They definitely go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable. Had a room in the paradise wing, which is a great location and right by the main pool. My room was well appointed and recently updated. I also had a nice patio with furniture. I will be back. </DOC> This historic Frank Lloyd Wright designed hotel is an architectural masterpiece that has not only withstood the test of time, but has continued to thrive. Having had Hollywood royalty stay here along with US Presidents, this hotel is fit for anyone who enjoys gorgeous surroundings and first rate amenities/staff. The grounds are immaculately groomed with lovely sprites and the rooms are beautifully appointed. They are spacious, some have a balcony (though may have to be shared with your neighbors) and others with fire pits. Plenty of closet space, outlets, large shower, etc. will make your stay quite enjoyable. </DOC> It seems The Biltmore hasn't had up regular maintenance or upkeep, furnishings are old and dated. This used to be a gem in Scottsdale but no more. Food in restaurant is slowly delivered but tasty. Signage to main lobby is inadequate, be prepared to assist your Uber driver.",

If you are looking for more of a quaint experience, this is the right place, otherwise, a more modernly appointed hotel would be your choice. </DOC> This hotel is truly unique and amazing. Beautiful property and amenities. The restaurants are excellent. Very nice business services and top quality staff. This was my first time here and it was truly great. Architecture is fantastic!!! Golf was also top notch. You can't go wrong. </DOC> On a recent visit to Arizona we had an opportunity to spend time at the Biltmore. The accommodations are lovely but the touches of design by Frank Lloyd Wright are what make this property truly unique. The staff are all gracious and very helpful. Time spent in these surroundings is relaxing and peaceful. </DOC> I booked a stay in February at this resort. Unfortunately the calibre of service provided has been extremely lacking in a hotel of this price point. I received an email from the concierge saying she would assist me in any bookings etc. The few times I emailed her back asking a few questions, I would get a bounceback email. Then no response. I then emailed the general concierge email. Also no response. I emailed them asking to cancel my reservation and rebook the date. No response from anyone. Frustrating and disappointing. If you offer your personal concierge services, I'm expecting a response when I do reach out with a time sensitive request. </DOC> The hotel in general is nice, but everything seems plan around conferences or other types of events. It doesn't feel like a Hilton family hotel. The benefits for Diamond member are weak: $15 credit per day for breakfast where a small pot of coffee costs $9, plus two small bottle of water per stay. The front desk service needs some improvement. Wait time for the checking in is longer than 20 minutes. During the checking out, they do not allow me to have the $15 credit for the day of checking out and suggested I should have used it on the day of checking in (how? I checked in around 9 pm on that day). The person had to check with his manager in the back to make this looks obvious correction. In addition, be careful on you room selection. Some level of noise is almost unavoidable due to the conference activities after hour. </DOC> We\u2019ve only been here for 24 hours of our six day stay, but this hotel clearly deserves five stars. The service is impeccable, the food is delicious and reasonably priced, and the amenities are incredible. I especially have loved the Sunday brunch and pools. Thanks for making this getaway with our family so much fun. </DOC> The Biltmore Hotel is a Frank Lloyd Wright influenced property built by Willam K Wrigley in the 1930's. I is very well done and I love the architecture. Phoenix is hot, but they have managed to beat the heat with covered walkways, pools, and shade. I would rate this very high on my list of places that I have ever stayed. </DOC> I\u2019ve stayed here on numerous occasions, it isn\u2019t cheap but you get what you pay for\u2026beautiful grounds, lovely rooms and more importantly fantastic service. This was the first time eating at one of the resort restaurants and I\u2019m glad we did as my wife and I both loved the food at Frank & Albert\u2019s. I always select one of the Ocatilla rooms as the standard of service from the team in the lounge is above and beyond, Susan especially has been consistently exceptional. No surprise that this is my preferred hotel when in Phoenix.",

The grounds itself are impeccable and rooms are clean. The casita is seriously awesome! Travelers of all ages would love it! </DOC> The Biltmore is a great choice for anyone that appreciates Frank Lloyd Wright architecture, or anyone who just appreciates a hotel with great service. The property is enormous and definiately takes more than a day to get a lay of the land, as all buildings are very similar in color. There are quite a few salt water pools, one with a water slide (that unfortunately closes before 4pm), and an on site gym with much more equipment than your standard hotel. The staff was fantastic in greeting and throughout the stay. I am sure it is even more enjoyable during peak season. </DOC> After a very disappointing stay at a luxury resort in Sedona this place was a very welcome respite and experience. It is immaculate landscaped, maintained and absolutely beautiful. Every single person working there really made me feel like they enjoyed being there, and helping guests. Our ocatilla club room with lounge access was divine, we also had our own concierge which was a nice touch. I will say that I visited a few friends rooms, as I was there for a conference, and the standard rooms were definitely no different then a Hampton Inn equivalent. The ocatilla rooms were well appointed and the soaking tub was awesome. Front desk folks were really great. Parking was not a problem, although the main parking garage is far off the property if you don't find spots elsewhere. Pools were beautiful. Tons of places to sit and relax, fire pits and really nice ambience. Loved it!! </DOC> If you're going to Phoenix you are well advised to stay at the Arizona Biltmore... bask in the historical Frank Lloyd Wright elegance, enjoy the shops and pool, and great food in several restaurants. Play golf at their well kept and challenging golf course or just stroll the magnificent gardens the comprise this resort's grounds. One caveat, the weather was so nice that we booked lunch in the caf\u00e9 with outdoor tables and had to move inside as the aggressive resident crow murder, enticed by the young kids unhindered by the parents engrossed in their cell phones who tossed French fries around to enjoy the otherwise quiet ambience of this great resort. Don't miss the hallway to the rest rooms just off of the main lobby where photos of famous guests are displayed. </DOC> This is, without question, the best hotel I've ever visited. Everything about the Arizona Biltmore was simply perfect during our recent visit. I can't imagine a more beautiful, peaceful setting for a few days of quiet relaxation. It's not a hip and happening urban party spot, but quite the opposite. It has a timeless, elegant, and tranquil atmosphere that just seeps into you despite your best efforts to stay on top of the world outside. The room was beautifully appointed, service staff outstanding, and the food was quite tasty. Pricing is appropriate for a resort of this caliber but worth every penny. Can't wait to return. </DOC> After a week at the Grand Canyon, a couple nights in Vegas for New years and LOTS of cold weather we were looking forward to relaxing at the beautiful accommodations of the Arizona Biltmore. I would highly recommend using the valet as the self-parking options are pretty limited and can be quite frustrating as you may be required to walk a considerable distance to your room depending on what part of the resort you stay. The hotel has a lot of history and beautiful d\u00e9cor, fantastic pools, onsite games inside and out. Some of the residences are in need of remodeling as they are showing their age but really is a great place to stay. Preferred Members: I was informed by the front desk that this property does not participate in extending special amenities to preferred guests to include room upgrades or lounge access...that was very disappointing. </DOC> The buildings are so great and historic it's wonderful to get lost in the history. The rooms are well appointed we stayed in the ocatilla wing. I wish we had stayed in a villa or suite as the bathrooms in this wing are a bit tight. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean but would have enjoyed a patio or balcony to sit out on. The service was wonderful and check in was fast. I enjoyed this hotel and would stay here again for sure. </DOC> Disclosure status with the hotel and usually get upgraded. I stayed again at this property for business for a four day stay. Again the staff are amongst the best in the business - friendly professional and efficient. The rooms are very comfortable and well appointed for work, entertainment and relaxation. The gym is well , spa-worthy. Spacious many machines and even with our big group not full. The pools are great as are the restaurants and bars. Worth a trip and worthy every penny.",

Note upper floor does not have a lift so you are required to walk 1 flight of stairs (possibly with bags unless you use a porter). The gym is adequate, has yoga mats but not much floor space since it is used up by machines. The sauna was also nice and free! Did no try any massage or treatments. </DOC> We spent a night at Arizona Biltmore on our way back from Sedona and it was good for that purpose. As we walked to our room at the back of the property we were blown away by the manicured lawns and beautiful gardens. Getting to the room after that was a bit of a let down. The room itself was nice sized with a balcony and modern furniture but was absolutely soul-less. The decorator definitely struck the jackpot if the goal was lack of character and blah resort rooms! We ate breakfast at Frank & Albert's and that was nice. It is not an expensive property so I would stay again if in transit but for a more luxurious vacation look elsewhere! </DOC> I adored my stay with the Arizona Biltmore! The grounds and the hotel interior are fabulous and luxurious. There are multiple pools and even one with a swim-up bar and they are open year round and the water temp is maintained at 84 degrees! The different hotel restaurants offer a wide variety of choices. The free history tour is a must do during your stay! </DOC> Beautiful grounds with palm trees and swimming pools. Historic hotel, I didn\u2019t get a chance to go on the free history tour. Several dining options. Room was clean. Most of the staff was helpful and friendly. I wish I could have visited the spa. Good place for a conference. </DOC> We are not fans of large resort type hotels but were keen to see the Lloyd Wright architecture and experience the history that is the Arizona Biltmore. From check in to departure we found the staff friendly and helpful even if at times very busy. This place seems to hold a lot of conferences which sometimes detracts from the property. However, this place is so large that accommodating such events seems not to be a problem. The art deco style of the hotel is very appealing as is its rich history and who's who guest list. It was nice to experience this for a few nights. Recommended. </DOC> Absolutely the most comfortable bed and pillows ever! The hotel is laid out a little quirky but you won't care once you step into your room. It was absolutely amazing. I was there for a work meeting and they didn't disappoint when it came to feeding 200+ people either. </DOC> I thought this place was going to be fantastic, based on what I had heard about it. The grounds were beautiful, and the staff was first class. Here are my issues. My first room was dirty, so the staff put me in a different room and sent me an apology. But it still wasn't as clean as I would expect for the Biltmore. For example, I wanted to open the vent in the bathroom, it was closed, and it looked like it had never been cleaned. The sofa has stains on it. Other small things, like hair on the ceiling in the bathroom, which I think is gross. The toilet also wasn't working right, which I would think they would catch for the price of this hotel. The workout room was nice, and again the grounds are beautiful. </DOC> The Biltmore is a fabulous property. The expansive grounds are beautiful and well maintained. The Frank Lloyd wright statuary and stained glass wonderful. The rooms and service great. My wife did not want to check out!",

        "docs": "If I could give this 3.5 I would. The new rooms left me a bit disappointed. I hate the move to a lack of bath tubs and a more dorm look. I also was disappointed by the limited room service menu given the restaurant choice in the hotel. The gym, on the other hand, was top notch. Huge and plenty of machines. Also a lovely pool. </DOC> Stayed at LA airport Marriott on a transit to IOWA. Was upgraded to the 1 bedroom suite. The hotel\u2019s renovation was completed and the new look is fabulous. Suite room is spacious, clean and quiet. Newly renovated restaurants were also opened for use. In all, hotel is highly recommended for transit stay before processing on the next trip. Dr E. Chow </DOC> It has been nearly two years since my last stay in the hotel, Marriott LAX now is my favorite transit hotel in LAX area. The shuttle is shared with Renaissance and Marriott which is very convenient to get from and to airport. The hotel is recently renovated and it's nearly done. My room was very clean and new; nice bright bathroom with a large shower and the desk is easy to work; best thing is now you can easily slide your big luggage under the bench while the carry on bags stay on the bench! Very nice design for travelers with more luggages. Club lounge is indeed a lot better than before, I love how the GM actually came in the morning to check on the operation and even helped his crew to clear a few tables and engaged quick chat with hotel guests. </DOC> Absolute worst Marriott! The shuttle from LAX never stopped at T4, so I took a cab and demanded reimbursement. Upon the cabbie being pissed and dropping my bags on the street and leaving, there was no bellman to assist with luggage. Check in was easy but I made it known it was unacceptable for a Marriott to have such low service standards. I'm a platinum premier with over 300 nights a year at Marriott, I know what to expect and was less than pleased. The hotel is old the rooms are small it's nothing more than a standard hotel. Further the hotel is extremely large so there's loads of people doing the exact same thing as you one night at hotel to access LAX...For one night ok maybe but without reliable transportation to airport and from, I'd stay elsewhere. Plenty of other choices in the area. </DOC> I was pleasantly surprised by the standard, service and cleanliness of this hotel. It\u2019s not often that an airport hotel provides all 3 well, and for a reasonable rate. The bed was very comfortable, it\u2019s insulated from the airport noise, there\u2019s a good gym and pool, the bathroom had just the right level of toiletries, the shower was powerful and there are a good choice of eateries in the hotel. There\u2019s a free LAX courtesy shuttle running 24/7, taking about 15 mins to the terminals. If I had a stopover again, I\u2019d certainly stay here. </DOC> The hotel is very clean. The employees are friendly, professional and helpful. This is a great location when traveling through LAX. The rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable. We were on the 1st floor next to a roadway yet we never heard traffic. We ate at the sports bar located in the hotel. The happy hour was pretty good. The food was very good. We had the nachos and they were good. The wings were coming out in droves and everyone liked them. There is a Starbucks located inside too. We have stayed here several times when traveling and will continue to do so in the future. </DOC> Love the Marriotts and this one is terrific. Beautifully remodeled it is clean, open and modern. Rooms are comfortable and staff very accommodating. We stopped for a late night snack upon arrival and it was delicious and fresh. Very impressive. </DOC> We spent 4 days at this property and found it delightful. The rooms were spacious with full balconies and great bath soaps and shampoo. The concierge lounge on the 18th floor was really nice for breakfast, and evening snacks along with deserts. Staff was delightful and the lobby area had a nice resruarant as well as pool and gym.",

        "docs": "We often do an overnight stay in LA prior to an international flight. After a dismal experience at this hotel many years ago, we always opted for the nearby Renaissance. When I read there had been a renovation, we decided to give it a try The hotel is modern and spacious. The rooms are comfy. The M lounge is huge and best of all monitored most of the day so it does not get overcrowded as a result of crashers. The food is pretty good. Very good service. We would return </DOC> This Marriott is our favorite hotel for a quick overnight between airline flights. Convenient, shuttle to the hotel, nice restaurants and bar, friendly staff. Newly redecorated in relaxing colors. Remodeled lobby area. </DOC> The hotel is going through a refurbishment programme and therefore things may change. Our room was on the 16th (mostly refurbished) floor and although there were things to pick up on - e.g. there is an energy saving sensor that turns off the lights when it detects no movement in the room, unfortunately it also turns off the lights when one is sitting reading in bed leading to exaggerated arm movements to get them to switch on again. Having said that the bed was wonderfully comfortable - one of the best hotel beds I have experienced. Due to the work it was a little noisy and until this is completed it might be advisable to avoid the lift area (colleagues mentioned excessive noise from the lounge area). One final thing, the tea pots in the coffee shop have a mind of their own, Trying to get liquid out of them without spillage 'aint easy! </DOC> The Airport Marriott has recently been remodel and the rooms look fresh and inviting. My husband and I stayed on the concierge floor in a Jr. Suite with a couch and updated bath. Everything appeared fine until I turned up the heat and realized after an hour we were still cold. I called the front desk who sent up an engineer to fix the problem. He said something had been disconnected and he fixed it. It was late and we needed to wake early for a flight so we started to get ready for bed. An hour later we noticed we still had no heat and spent the night cold. This is the first time this has happened but on my next trip I am looking for another hotel. </DOC> They know that almost everyone there is traveling on business. Or having meetings. So they understand. Privacy. Quick service. And quick turn around. The hotel lobby is large. Sports bar. Great eatery and a lot of parking. Highly recommend for overnight while traveling or having meetings or conventions. </DOC> Room was quiet on 18th floor. Bathroom light did not work. Hard to see. Arrived late at night and just wanted to sleep. Club was fine for breakfast, with terrific view of south runways. Staff were exceptionally nice. Alarm went off at 6:00 a.m. unexpectedly. A/c was very noisy. Facilities were not up to Marriott standards. </DOC> We stayed here on an overnight stay on our way back to Australia. The staff are friendly, the bed is comfortable and the shuttle stuff are very helpful in helping us bring our 8 suitcases and baby. The only issue we had was the shuttle took forever, but it's LAX, so traffic isn't exactly the best. We also had our baby and dog with us and their was ample room. </DOC> Very close to the airport with quiet rooms and great shuttle service back and forth between hotel and airport. All of the employees are very friendly, courteous, and helpful. The fitness area is nice and fairly large, with three separate areas for cardio machines, Universal-type equipment, and free weights. The pool looks like a nice area, though it doesn't seem to get much sunshine. There are a couple self-service laundry machines on the lower level that seemed to be in constant use. Even though the hotel is very close to the airport, signs posted in the shuttle bus warn of the possibility of the ride to the airport taking as much as 45 minutes. It didn't take us that long the day we rode, but with all the construction and traffic going on at LAX, it is easy to visualize that possibility. Plan your ride to the airport accordingly.",

Not much to look at from the outside but inside is a great pool scene and a huge workout facility. Quick shuttle service to/from LAX. Highly recommend. </DOC> Pros Great space to hang out after work and relax Lots and lots and lots of plugs Lots of lights Very bright light by one window Spacious bathroom Cons NEED A FULL SIZE MIRROR..every woman wants to look her whole outfit...so I placed a picture on her of the wall it should go on...simply and cheap fix </DOC> I arrived at the hotel after an all night flight at 530 am and was able to get into my comfortable room with the Marriott signature bed. It felt good. The staff went out of their way to accommodate. The room was clean, plenty of ways to charge phones and computers, the internet was fast. Missing was some water and a coffee machine. The swimming pool was nice, slightly heated but still quiet cool and refreshing. The on property Starbucks was a lifesaver when I checked out at 6 am I had a steak at the steakhouse and it was excellent together with great service. Once you step into the hotel you feel you're in a different world and not at an airport hotel. I can surely recommend this property, and I stayed at many other LAX airport hotels before. </DOC> Good one-night stay here and it was my first time here. Room was renovated and modern. A lot of power plugs were between beds.. The lounge was 24 hours and amazing. It was facing the LAX runway so you can see the planes taking off and landing... Parking was really expensive though... </DOC> The newly remodeled lobby areas are great and make the hotel so much nicer and more luxurious and modern. This hotel is always busy but generally the staff is very attentive to customers. Great lobby restaurants and the rooms are great. My fav is the M Lounge in the top floor. I stay at this hotel whenever I can! </DOC> This hotel has been around forever - they seem to continue to update it. Good selections for meals - great rooms. Health club not as extensive as it used to be but still works well. Good for the Marriott crowd near LAX </DOC> The hotel looks very new and trendy. It is also close to the airport. Unfortunately, they do not have a lot of shuttles. While waiting, we saw other shuttles more than once. That is the only criticism I have. We were checked in quickly. Our room had a very comfortable bed and a great shower. After coming home from Bangkok via Hong Kong, we loved it! We had also dinner at the excellent restaurant on the first floor. We took appetizers and the portions were enormous especially after our stay in Asia. Everything was very tasty. Reasonable price also for an airport hotel </DOC> We stayed one night before an early morning flight. The location was great. It was very close to the rental car drop off, so we could return our car early. They have a shuttle that was prompt and convenient. I usually do not eat in the hotel, but the food we saw coming out of the kitchen while we were in the lounge looked great, so we ordered in the lounge. Everything we had was excellent, and the service was very good, too. Rooms were clean, bed was great.",

The hotel has been very comfortable, clean and so convenient to the airport. We have had a great night's sleep on each occasion. Even though our room is looking straight at the runway, there is absolutely no noise and it's fascinating to see two planes either landing or taking off side-by-side on parallel runways. There is a great, free hotel shuttle service that you pick up at the shuttle meeting point at the airport that will take you to and from the hotel in about ten minutes. While the hotel has a great heated pool, we unfortunately did not have time to enjoy it. We would recommend staying on the fourth floor in a king bedroom with a bay view. </DOC> Stayed here for work trip and the accommodations were very nice. Prices were very fair though they do hit you for parking... Rooms were very clean and comfortable and the service was prompt and very helpful. </DOC> In all my years traveling (female) I have never been greeted so well. I walk in the lobby at 5:30...first I am greeted at all..yes and very kindly...offered a glass of wine at check in..yes..free. Jacklyn checked me in. Her service was impeccable! Room was clean and the bed luscious. And... loved the touch of lavender oil they offer to help you relax. Towel quality was great and shower and bath high end regarding the shower and faucets. Keurig coffer. Service was excellent but restaurant service was slow...really slow but food was decent. Highly recommend it over the local Hiltons on service alone. I will be back!! </DOC> The Westin is an all purpose hotel used by a variety of people for all sorts of reasons. Either for business, or use as a long term parking lot or for a holiday headquarters this hotel meets the bill. The spacious rooms are sound proofed by double pane glass which keeps the jet sounds to a minimum, thank god. currently the hotel offers a free happy hour 1700-1800 hours with cheese crackers and beer and wine! The front desk staff are hard working minions with smiles to share. The airport shuttle is a big church truck with seating for about 20 individuals. Not a bad choice in this part of the world. </DOC> Fun to watch the planes land and takeoff from the rooms, and a beautiful bayside park just across the street good for a morning stretch of the legs. Hotel is enormous, as has all the amenities one expects from a Westin. Like most airport hotels, it sees a lot of traffic, so the furniture and bathroom fittings are a bit worn. Be mindful of the shuttle schedule, especially if arriving late in the day. </DOC> We hadn't stayed here in a while and they have renovated the lobby, the bar and restaurant. The rooms are clean, good size and comfortable. Little if any outside noise. The staff is friendly and professional. The bar and restaurant (sports bar type) are fine. The breakfast buffet seemed rather pricey but there are other options. Would definitely stay here again as it is so convenient to airport. Also a nice walkway across the street that gives you a chance to get fresh air and stretch your legs after long flights. </DOC> Booked here because my family and I had an early flight out. Great shuttle service to the airport. Clean, quiet and comfortable rooms. Very friendly and helpful staff. Would stay here again. On site restuarant was very good. </DOC> I had meetings in the city as well as in the Bay Area. Staying at this hotel allowed me access to the Millbrae Caltrain station which I used during my entire stay for travelling throughout the Bay Area (and the city). The hotel has an excellent breakfast and as a Platinum guest I was given a free breakfast voucher.",

        "docs": "Stayed here overnight on our way to a baseball game in Oakland. Arrived around 9:30 PM. Even though it wasn\u2019t that crowded, I still wound up waiting to check in due to the front desk clerk being on the phone. Okay, I understood that. She finally waited on us and we got our room,but then we had to wait for one of the slowest elevators I\u2019ve ever seen. Got to the room, it was fine, typical Westin, although the room felt and looked dated. The hotel has a free shuttle to the airport, which we used the next day, which is great. We had stayed here last year on our way to Hawaii, and I was not too impressed this time. Besides the shuttle, not much to make me want to return. </DOC> This location couldn't be better for early morning flights from SFO. Rooms are clean and comfortable. Staff was outstanding. Happy hour wine/beer reception was fun. Being walking distance from the NE Style Lobster restaurant around the corner makes it a +++!!! </DOC> A typical airport hotel overlooking the bay. Nothing great and nothing bad but definitely overpriced. Rooms are getting a bit tired and bathrooms definitely need updating. Airport shuttle worked well. </DOC> Overall, this property was a great spot to fall asleep before flying the next morning. The property itself is a bit old, but it's clear they've worked hard to keep it modern and updated. Bedrooms were a standard format and very comfortable. Hotel offers a full service suite of offerings, although none of them extensive (nice restaurant but only one, fitness center albeit on the small side, room service, and a shuttle). On the plus side, the property has shared access to the newer Aloft hotel, including their pool. On the downside, they also share an airport shuttle, which can often result in standing room only on the shuttle. I'd definitely stay here again when next flying from SFO. </DOC> Not a bad restaurant for a hotel, the food wasn't great but there isn't much else around there. They had a good wine list and it was mid priced but I wouldn't highly recommend eating here unless you don't want to drive somewhere. It's casual and has a sit down bar in it so it feels like a cross over between a happy hour bar and a restaurant. </DOC> The hotel needs a little TLC as it's a bit tired in places. That said the bed was comfortable and the room and bathroom were very clean. Service in the lobby bar and restaurant was very friendly and the food at supper and breakfast was simple but tasty. For an airport overnight stop it's fine and it has Sixth car rental on-site. </DOC> Ok airport hotel. Good condition. Clean. However, it does NOT have a lounge for Gold/Platinum members. Convenient to SFO and shuttle is convenient. If you get a 'bay view', it is nice to see the airport watching planes take off/land, plus the hotel is insulated pretty well against the noise from the jets. </DOC> Stayed here two nights. Very convenient next to airport. Room was reasonably clean, carpet was a little dirty. Room had a slight odor maybe musty. Lighting was poor, very low overall. Ned was comfortable. Hotel has nice amenities. Staff was very friendly and helpful.",

Hotel offers an early breakfast (with lots of fresh fruit) for the business traveler, shuttle service to the airport, and has a large comfortable lobby for decompressing . It\u2019s the better of the SF airport hotels I\u2019ve experienced. </DOC> Stayed here for 2 nights as part of a business training course. I like the location so close to airport and free shuttles running regularly to and from. Also a $10 can ride or 10 min walk to the nearest BART subway station that will take you right to the waterfront. Also it shares a parking lot with the ALOFT hotel so point collectors can get 2 stays! Hotel itself is very nice. Easy checkin. Great main floor restaurant. Helpful staff. Conference room we had was perfect for training for 15 people with breakout tables at the back. I\u2019ll be back. </DOC> Spent one night in this hotel to board a flight the next morning. Arrived by air, the hotel shuffle arrived in 15 minutes. Fast check in. Our room was on the 6 th floor, spacious and clean. No airport noise whatsoever. Plenty of room for all our luggage. Ate dinner at the Grill in the hotel. Excellent service, food was good but nothing special except the prices. But that is to be expected at a hotel. Checkout the next morning was again fast and easy. Shuttle came quickly. The hotel staff were very friendly and efficient. Would definitely stay here again, a very nice place considering it is an airport hotel. </DOC> Located about 5 minutes from the airport via free shuttle bus. The room was a good size, and very comfortable. The room featured an iron & ironing board, safe, chair, desk, coffee machine, & a large flat screen tv. Wifi was free & fast. Two bottles of free drinking water were provided. The bed was very comfortable and provided a great nights sleep. The bathroom was small and featured a shower / tub combo, which was really the only negative about the hotel. I ordered a steak from room service and it was delicious.' I read quite a few negative reviews of this hotel, but I found it to be very good and would not hesitate to stay here again. </DOC> This is a large airport hotel. It has a great shuttle service. Check in was easy. Room standard - nothing special, view of the car park. The restaurant is small considering the size of the hotel. We had a great pizza and wine for an easy dinner there. SPG plat member. </DOC> Booked via marriott for 115$. Checked in early at 10AM and got an upgraded room. King bed, great big LCD TV with good selection, good bathroom, nice view and good wifi. As a gold member, got offered breakfast but chose points instead (1000 points). They do have a great gym and pool. Shuttle service to and from airport were good and on time. A good stopover hotel. </DOC> Hotel airports are never eye popping when it comes to service or the venue. Westin SF airport is better than most, but I still expected more. I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s so hard to get things \u2018great\u2019. Beds were very clean and comfortable which is all I wanted and expected. I\u2019d stay here again, and to anyone else I\u2019d suggest managing your expectations a little if you want something special.",

You will miss out on the hot tub if you don't ask the front desk where it is since it's not visible when you go to the pool area. The sheets and duvet, and the room had the smell of sweat/persperation so that was not pleasant. Room service food was exceptional. Parking is not free, be ready to pay quite a bit more due to the downtown location. Normal for city centre hotels since land is expensive and scarce. The price of the room being so inexpensive makes up for the cost of parking. </DOC> This Embassy Suites has a great location, right next to the convention center...but it needs work. The main complaint was housekeeping. I traveled with 4 other people and they all experienced the same problem with their rooms not properly cleaned. The coffee was filled with the same hazelnut flavor, or tea, never with regular coffee. My fridge contained a few needles in a bag (maybe insulin...but seriously!). Not a bad place...but needs to shape up. </DOC> Chose this hotel for the location and price and were very happy with our choice. The room was very clean. The hotel staff were very friendly and the breakfast better than average. Would stay here again. </DOC> We stay here when we come to Denver for a performance at the Performing Arts Center, as we can walk to it and also walk to Larimer Square restaurants and elsewhere. We liked the size of the rooms, how the upper floors are shielded from the noise of the lower levels. Also enjoy the sumptuous breakfasts and happy hours. The parking at $44 a night is getting a little expensive. Also our bathroom had some unrepaired drywall issues in the ceiling (#1007), looked like they started something then didn't finish. Overall, still four strong bullets, particularly for the price we got...they do raise their rates during special events, etc, which is not a practice I do not support. </DOC> I checked in to this hotel and had a good stay. We stayed here as it was close to the convention center and we had some things going on there. We were on a motorcycle vacation. The hotel is motorcycle friendly. I parked in the garage and paid the valet fee. The managers reception was packed but we did have free drinks and some snacks provided. Breakfast was included and very good. Omelettes cooked to order as well as all the other expected breakfast items. Special shout to Justin the supervisor of Valet for taking care of me. I also had some help from Alex the hotel supervisor. He was extremely helpful and flexible. People like this make the business what it is. Everyone was great. The staff is wonderful all around. thank you Hilton for a great stay. That\u2019s why I am an honors member and stay Hilton whenever possible </DOC> A typical Embassy Suites. Nothing new under the sun. Front Desk Staff took good care of the travel professionals in town for an event and Housekeeping was good. Bartending staff was hot and cold. One young bartender could not have been ruder; another more experienced one could not have been nicer or more helpful. Most important asset is the proximity to the convention center and all that downtown Denver has to offer. </DOC> Located just a block from the Denver Convention Center is this tall modern hotel with entrance to the registration desk on the fourth floor. All rooms are suites with a couch, small frig, microwave and TVs in the living room and bedroom. Very comfortable with good air condition. WiFi is free and adequate. A breakfast buffet is free and average in the selections offered. The crowds are large in the morning but seating is sufficient. Staff are friendly and professional. Seating in the living room is good. Parking is available for a daily fee. A large workout room is available. The bathroom is a good size but no bathtub shower slip pad is available. </DOC> Stayed at this hotel for a conference. Location is GREAT! Right across the street. Nice room, typical of Embassy.

Literally across the street from the convention center- huge breakfast (including made to order omelette a, if you have time to wait in line) and really nice staff. Starbucks right next to entrance to hotel. Managers reception is nothing to get excited about, though.

Fitness center seemed slightly on the small side, but had a good variety of cardio and resistance equipment. Breakfast buffet and cooked to order eggs and omelets were also a huge plus. They did have a managers reception, but with only one bartender, the lines tended to be at least 15 minutes to get a drink. Other than that, this place was very solid and highly recommended. </DOC> Nice comfortable room just right for the three of us, good bathtub, air conditioning worked well. BUT there aren\u2019t enough functioning elevators so we spent way too much time waiting. Getting our car out of valet took way too long and we were told that we were lucky \u201cfive more minutes\u201d wasn\u2019t 15 or 20. </DOC> I can\u2019t say enough great things about this hotel. Great location 2 blocks from 16th st mall, easy check in and friendly staff. Room set up is perfect. Living room opens to kitchen area and bathroom then another door to bedroom. The bed is like a cloud. Black out shades that worked and great ac. There were 3 sinks total in the room, mini fridge and microwave. Lots of outlets and plenty of lighting. Our room was by elevator and we never heard a thing. Elevators were pretty quick never waited more than a few minutes. Ordered room service one night and the build your own chicken sandwiches were perfectly prepared. Garlic and sweet potatoes fries were equally delicious. Had flourless chocolate cake cake for dessert. Very reasonably priced. This is my new go to when staying in Denver. </DOC> I recently spent a night at this Downtown Denver property and was very happy with the hotel and service. First the pros: very friendly clerks who went out of their way to provide great recommendations and directions. The rooms was a great size and clean. The bathroom was newer and spotless. The location is terrific, two blocks from 16th Street, which is close enough, but just far enough away to be quiet. The breakfast was MUCH better than other Embassy Suites I have visited, and everything was delicious. The cons: the only parking option is very expensive valet. There was also a slight odor in the hallway in the morning (before and after breakfast), but that very well could have just been a guest or misplaced room service trays. Overall, this hotel is a great choice if you need a place in downtown Denver. I will certainly return if business brings me back into town. </DOC> I've got nothing substantial to criticise about this place, and much to appreciate. Friendly, helpful check-in staff, good room, brilliant bed. Good breakfast. Rather odd arrangement at the entrance - reception on the 4th floor! Highly recommended - go.",

        "docs": "The hotel is in a good location for business. Staff were friendly and helpful to resolve issues quickly. Room was updated and quiet and had nice city/mountain views, but was not exactly clean. As a Diamond, I generally know what to expect and I got the impression that this hotel lacks the staff to handle the high turnover for a convention type hotel. Upon arrival, dirty plates from previous guest were outside of the room and stayed there until the next day, food pieces were on the couch, there was no soap in the bathroom, lotion was used and not replaced fresh, and no fitted sheets were on the bed. While all minor issues that were easily fixed, collectively they do not provide a good impression and improvements are needed to make this hotel worth the price. </DOC> This is a lovely downtown hotel. The rooms are spacious, modern and well lit, the beds are super comfortable, the breakfast is plentiful and delicious, the amenities are great and the location is perfect - close to all of the downtown action, especially the 16th Street Mall. The internet works well here. The rooms were sparkling clean. It's set up like every Embassy Suites, with a pantry (mini-store), nice pool (no hot tub unfortunately) but unlike most Embassy Suites, this one has a nice restaurant & bar. Super handy! It's a good-looking place, too. We enjoyed our stay here and the staff was friendly. Thanks Embassy Suites! </DOC> When I have the occasion to visit donwtown Denver I enjoy returning to the Embassy. Its location in the center of it all is quite convenient. The rooms are very comfortable and clean. The parking is quite expensive but hey you are in the center of town. We will return. </DOC> This place is in an ideal location for conventioneers, business folk and tourists alike. So, it IS a busy place. The room was fine. Nice view of the mountains. The parking seems kind of expensive. You might have better luck at nearby lots. The room service cheeseburger was good. Breakfast was a mob scene. But with a little reconnaissance I was able to feed myself without waiting too long. It's a two block walk to the 16th Street Mall. Some of the furnishings are a little dinged up. I might return. I might not. </DOC> The wife and I stayed here one night before moving the the Curtis. The location is great, right next to the convention center. The hotel is modern and decorated beautifully and the room was great. The breakfast and managers cocktail hour was one of the best. The breakfast and drinks are a huge savings even if you pay a little more for the room. I highly recommend this hotel and hope to come back for a longer stay. </DOC> Our flight to SF via Denver was late due to weather and we had to stay over a night in Denver with our kids. We all fit comfortably in one suite at this Embassy Suites. The breakfast was average but quite a bonus considering it was included in the room rate. We loved the location and we were able to visit the Denver mint while there. If this was helpful please let me know by checking that box. Thank you. </DOC> We stayed in the hotel during the Thanksgiving holiday. For what we paid just over $100 a night, I found the hotel a great value. The hotel is well maintained, at a convenient location, and offers free breakfast and evening reception. The hotel is close to the 16th street, and within walking distance to many places in downtown. The room is a suite, and has a separate living room, although the bedroom is quite crowded. The manager's reception in the evening includes wine and beer, although the refreshments were limited and the line was sometime long and slow to get food. The selection for breakfast included omelets made to order, but again the line was often long and slow. In any event, I do not think one should complain about the long lines for free stuff. </DOC> We booked a room around the holidays to spend time downtown before Christmas. The Embassy Suites was a beautiful find. The tall glass atrium and expansive lobby gave the hotel an elegant feel. The rooms are nicely appointed and spacious. Good wifi, attentive front desk staff. Perfect location, central to all the restaurants and features near the convention center and 16th Street. Breakfast was more substantial than I expected and the service was very good.",

        "docs": "This is our third or fourth time staying here. We are happy with the location because it is near many restaurants and shops. The hotel also has a restaurant and jet ski tours available. The beds are still comfortable and the room was clean. The room has a washer and dryer. There was a washer issue but did not notice until morning of check out. Good WiFi connection in room and around pool. We have only stayed in the waterfront rooms overlooking pier and beach area. The pool bar closes at 7pm. The pool area was fairly clean. Overall, a great stay most likely to stay a fifth and sixth time. </DOC> We stayed here for a wedding and had a 2 bedroom suite. We have 2 small children and brought my parents along to watch them while we attended a wedding. The hotel was able to provide a crib for my baby and we had plenty of room. There was also a full kitchen and living room. We did rent a car since we did not want to wait for the shuttle with small children. The room was very clean and modern. We would stay again if with the family. </DOC> Loved it. Upgrade to the presidential suite is absolutely worth it. Beautiful view and lovely balcony. I can't say enough about the staff, Olivier made check in a breeze, Alex is a wonderful bartender, speedy and delicious drinks. Great experience all around, can't wait to come back </DOC> First time in Key West, delighted with our choice. As a platinum guest, my family of 4 were upgraded to a 3-bed presidential suite. It is huge, we were truly spoiled. We had a warm welcome and were offered complimentary breakfasts throughout by the nice lady who checked us in. (Apologies for not taking the name). Three bedrooms, three bathrooms, a large living room and a fully equipped kitchen, and it was absolutely lovely. Boys loved the pool, we equally enjoyed the breakfasts. Joe from concierge was knowledgable in recommending the activities for our family. More bottled water were delivered after requesting them. The gym is a bit small, but it is reasonable for a good work out. Walking along the waterfront is a true joy and we loved our stay overall and will be back with more family stays! </DOC> Although this is on the bay side, it was a great view. It didn't have the type of beach you may have envisioned in your head, but it is a small beach area. It is very small and a little rocky. The room was awesome though! </DOC> Let's see, one tiny window, barely any light, overpriced property that doesn't compare to equivalent ones on the west coast, not even close. Upon not being more than an hour in the room, we asked for a full cancellation. Sorry cannot do that was the response. Reduced three night stay to a one night. I'm sure the other rooms may be great here, but the ones with smaller windows, not worth even $100/night, if that. Sorry, would strongly suggest taking your business elsewhere if you get one of these. Or better yet, you'd have a more enjoyable stay pitching a tent on a beach. </DOC> I love this Marriott. It is just at the beginning as you enter Key West so its just far enough fro the madness to paint the picture of a tropical setting, yet close enough to go out and party as you should in KW. Service is wonderful from the champagne check in to the happy hour specials pool side. Rooms are well maintained and are nothing less than what is expected of a Marriott property. </DOC> The Marriott Key West is one of the best properties on the Keys. Its a premium place at a premium cost. We stayed here for a couple of days and enjoyed breakfast each morning downstairs. The restaurant is pricey but excellent. The pool area is very nice with plenty of places to work on your tan. We enjoyed a presentation by Marine Scientist on the beach and this hotel gave us a nice opportunity to relax and clear our heads! Nice vacation.",

There is kitchen inside and we can cook food ourselves! There is supermarkets nearby and the hotel offer free shuttle to the city centre and airport. It is so convenient even though you dont drive. They also have a private beach but it seems it is not well maintained so i suggest you leave the beach itinerary back to miami. Staff here is also friendly and helpful! The only downside is that it is really an old hotel/resort but it is still very nice to stay here for a retreat! A wonderful stay, no complaint! </DOC> Chose this hotel because it's location, reviews and it's brand and we are glad we did. Great suite, friendly efficient service. The shuttle ran on time and made getting to Duval Street was easy. Would definitely stay here again. </DOC> This is one of the finest properties that Marriott operates. The dinner and happy hour specials were great. One of the best breakfast buffets I have every had. The transportation system to downtown was a big help. The staff members were very helpful but it was somewhat strange to see so many from another country. Not sure why and it is not a complaint but more of an observation. </DOC> We stayed four nights at the Marriott beachside hotel which is on the outskirts of Key West. We booked the Presidential suite and were not disappointed. There are 2 bathrooms, a separate shower room, a huge bedroom, kitchen and large living room and two balconies - one of which can be found up a flight of stairs to the rooftop. There was a decent enough breakfast which was included in the rate and staff were friendly. The hotel is a few miles from the tourist spots so a free shuttle bus is provided and runs every hour. Highly recommended hotel. </DOC> Just outstanding. Great hotel. Get the suite. Well worth the upgrade. Clean rooms. Great front desk staff. Shout out to Inkar, she was fantastic. Awesome pool. I think this is one of the best properties in Key West. Can\u2019t say enough good things about the place. It\u2019s awesome. </DOC> This is a pretty good property as far as Marriiott's go. You should know that the small room is essentially a \"lock off\" which is part of the larger suite and can be separated off. I really liked the service and the staff were pretty good. The pool/spa is open 24 hours which is amazing. There is a small section of beach if you want to experience sand. They are not even close to the tourist section (Duval St) but they do run a free shuttle bus to the area. Just as easy to Uber there. </DOC> Great trip to key west got their early room not ready so did tour of city. After checking in we headed back to down town Duval st for supper and drinks and entertainments. Their is a bus from hotel to the stop till 11 believe they are on time so don\u2019t miss time. Nice two bedroom suit. Lots of room done up very nice. It\u2019s pricy but nice. </DOC> I knew this would be a great stay when my wife and I received a complimentary flute of champagne at check-in. I thought this was a great touch and really made me realize paradise had arrived. I highly recommend this property! The restaurant was awesome, breakfast was delicious and the shuttle service to and from Duval St. was convenient.",

The views were outstanding, the room was very clean, the staff was very accommodating and the food on site was wonderful. The beach is great and very large. Two pools and plenty of bars, it does not get any better. </DOC> We visited in the 90's for a large family reunion before it was renovated. At that time, we loved the beach but, the hotel needed work. We returned last year (2016) and this time took our daugher, son in law and 4 year old grandtwins and we were in for a great time. The hotel is beautiful and the restaurants offer an excellent variety for adults and children. The fire dancer on the beach was a hit with the kids and the beach is pristine, clean and calm. The pools and the slide were awesome and the friendly and generous attitude of the staff and the guests is hard to beat. We are returning this summer for another vacation in June. </DOC> This is a fantastic luxury hotel. From the moment you pull up everyone on the staff is very friendly and helpful. Check in is easy and quick. Rooms have been remodeled and are very nice and clean. Great pool and the white sand beach is amazing. We will be back. </DOC> Wife and I went for a 5 night vacation. Room was nice, the facilities were great and the overall staff was outstanding. Fitness Center was very good. Resort Fee of $25/day was reasonable, especially since it got you a \"buy one, get one free\" buffet breakfast, and also got you two beach chairs and umbrella each day. Wife got a message at the Spa, which she said was great! Breakfast each day at Maia was great, with our hostess Katherine being wonderful. Lunch most days at Quinn's was fantastic. Dinner ranged from in town (10 minute walk) to the Pizza/pasta restaurant in the hotel which was very good. One of my wife's favorite Marriott Resorts! We definitely plan to come back!! </DOC> This was our first stay here and we were attracted to the JWM brand......but experienced a very large, crowded family resort. We enjoyed our stay and actually felt very pleased with the resort fee addon especially when we saw the wonderful breakfast buffet. Yes the rooms are updated with the bath in particular being very nice. The construction is ongoing but did not bother us. I would say expect more of a Marriott brand resort and you will be pleased. Also we had booked a terrific rate and resisted the checkin attempt to get us to pay more for an upgrade......which should have been included for Platinum members!? </DOC> Spent four nights at the JW Marriott Marco Island. Very clean. Caters to large groups as there were several meetings and conventions going on while we were there. Landscaping and grounds are lush and beautiful. Not sure why all the Hawaiian touches like the guy with fire at the nightly sunset ceremony. Prices are VERY expensive for food and drink. Enjoyed the beach and the multitude of shells. </DOC> I have been at the JW in Marco Island before. But they have now new buildings, more restaurants, the beach is awesome and after the refurbishing the rooms are great. It is a first class resort now. Been there three days, never getting out. Pools are outstanding, and breakfast is excellent. </DOC> Always such a pleasure staying here right on the beach... And as before the upgrade of the property to a JW has so many added benefits first of which is the staff!!! Such a great team working at the hotel from the valets taking your car to the pool staff to the team out at Quinn's... This is a must stay hotel in Southwest Florida!!!",

Our room overlooked a pool and we could also see the beach...sitting out on the balcony provided a great view! Our bathroom was huge! We want to have a home shower that resembled the shower we had in our room. The conference facilities were first rate. No complaints from anyone on that score. Self parking was across the road and a little bit of a walk, but not bad. We did not use the spa facilities or work-out room, so cannot comment on those. It is a resort with all the fees that go along with it, but it was a lovely place for a few days. We would love to stay in this resort again! </DOC> Looking for a place to stay or just a place to spend the day or relax at the spa than the JW Marriott at Marco Island is the best choice. The newly renovated addition is nearly complete. The restaurant are must try and there are several including Quinn's on the Beach. </DOC> We got the terrace suite, top floor and it and the hotel itself is awesome. Held a surprise birthday party for my wife and this hotel seriously blew us away. Room was one of the best we\u2019ve ever stayed in and beach and pool area are awesome. </DOC> The wifey an I stayed here for four nights during the NAHAD conference. This hotel is pricey but worth every penny. The staff, restaurants, pools, rooms common areas and grounds were all beautiful and top notch. The views and sunsets rivals my favorite spot in Maui. Great beach, white sand, blue water and shelling. I was fine never leaving the property. This was a dream working vacation. Hats off to the JW Marriott Marco Island. </DOC> Excellent resort located on the Gulf of Mexico. Full amenities. Uncharge resort fee includes hi speed wifi, a couple bottles of water daily, beach chairs and umbrella, spa workout and golf driving range privilege (balls and clubs). Friendly and helpful staff. Nice, newly remodeled rooms that are spacious and comfortable. Will return. </DOC> We usually stay at the Hilton, but it was closed for renovation, so we chose the Marriott. We love this place. From the time you enter the spacious lobby looking out onto the beach you will not want to leave. The entire staff is outstanding,but Joanne at the reception deck was super outstanding. She made every effort to accommodate our requests and made our two visits even more enjoyable. There are seven places to eat, two pools, beautiful beach..you never have to leave the hotel! There are several nice shops and even a real estate office so you can buy your own little piece of paradise! We have already made reservations to return in September. </DOC> The property is perfectly located in front of the beach, it has been recently been renovated and it looks fresh and nice. The rooms are big, all of them have a balcony. Comportable beds, plenty of towels and amenities! Flat screen TV, fridge! Many restaurants in the property and they serve breakfast until 11:00 which is perfect! Recommend! </DOC> This is probably our third business trip and this year we had a corner room, which I highly recommend. The accommodations and view were wonderful. The staff went the extra mile. There is so much to do including the beach, yoga on the beach, the spa, and the pools. There is also tours, too.",

Housekeeping also hit or miss but call to front desk resolved issues. SeaWorld right down the road so we made a visit. Also many restaurants within an easy drive. Wanted to golf...course looked awesome ... but we got time constrained. </DOC> This was our second visit. Our college age son was with us on spring break and there were a few other groups his age to hang with and play beach vball with. This resort feels too notch in all aspects, it doesn\u2019t feel like corners were cut anywhere. We stayed in a two bedroom setup which comes with a large living room and kitchen combo plus a screened in balcony and non-screened in balcony. We stayed 5 nights and visited disney and universal on a couple of the days. Both parks are within 20ish minutes of the parks and the airport. Staff was very friendly and accommodating and the gym was awesome with all Matrix equipment-a very high-end brand. See pics </DOC> Our daughter and grandson joined us From Scotland, and we had a two bed villa in block 93 overlooking golf course. Went three days to Disney parks and rested in between in the resort. Great staff, wonderful relaxing holiday. This location never disappoints and we have already booked a vacation for the same time in March 2019.

Our room was large and nicely decorated. A full kitchen and daily cleaning service. Loved the screened in veranda. We participated in the presentation for the time share. Others described it as high pressure but we found it quite pleasant and informative. No we did not buy one and that was ok with them.

We had stayed a few years back but we with this experience we will definitely stay again in the future. </DOC> This is the second time my family and I stayed at Grande Vista. Another great experience! Friend staff from check in to the grounds crew Everyone said hello and good morning, a very pleasant experience. There are a ton of activities for the whole family and they switch them up daily so not much repeats. It's good family fun! The resort is close to so much and is a great place to come back to after a fun day! We would for sure come a 3rd time! </DOC> An other great 10 days at Grande Vista- Amazing to say the least- our stand by in orlando for years now- The villas are well taken care of, staff is great and the property, pools, landscape and everything else is well done- Its a pleasure to return \"home\" to grande vista every day since it does feel like your home- Again a special thanks to Ethan the manager and the staff at the Grille, our go to breakfast place each day- wonderful food and staff! If you are looking for a family friendly home away from home- go to the grande vista- its the best! </DOC> We visit here almost annually. This may be our last. The front desk was as pleasant as ever no complaints. The room is great no complaints. The pools on the other hand; out of control. Absolutely not a single chair available. 25% of the chairs with towels but no people for hours on end. No Marriott personnel in the pool area to enforce 30 minutes rule on saving seats. Person passing out towels said she is instructed to not get involved with pool area. Food at the main pool could not be lower quality. The Grill restaurant was a dirty sports bar with kids running all over. Empty tables were covered with dirty plates and food from toddlers was all over the floor. Hope Marriott can turn this around. </DOC> Have not stayed here for a few years as during our last couple of visits the units were looking a little tired. We booked on the day and were sceptical as we knew it would be whatever was left - I was so happy the apartments have returned to their former glory. The lifts have been refurbished making entrance to the apartments so much more appealing. Our apartment was immaculately clean with modern furnishing. Staff were friendly and extremely helpful , we will definitely return Thank you to the staff here as after 2 bad experiences at JW Marriott Orlando and Sawgrass Marriott during this trip - you have restored my faith in the Marriott brand </DOC> Been visiting grande vista for years- at least three or four times a year- marriott platinum member- this resort is fantastic- updated review shows that the maintenance is still very well done compared to others I have read here- villas are great- location is amazing- pools are wonderful- home away from home- its just fantastic - cheers and enjoy- </DOC> This is a very large but still very nice resort, not far from Orlando Airport. Large, modern, clean room. Staff is friendly. Beautifully located around a small lake. Golf course directly adjacent. Had a standard room but still with lake view and balcony. </DOC> First of all, its in a very central location. It also has a team of professionals that makes you feel very welcome and are always approachable. We had a one-bedroom suite that was superb. Very comfortable bed and with ALL the amenities you would want in a quality resort. It was raining for three days, so we spent more time than expected in our room, so it was good to have all of the space and comfort we needed.

Usual Embassy Suites product with decent breakfast buffet but its gets crazy busy at this hotel the weekend we were there. Hotels rooms are on upper floor of building so didn't notice any road noise even though its busy on the streets. </DOC> I often select an Embassy Suites location because they are always good quality hotels. This one however is exceptionally nice. It is in a great location right on the lake front and it has a great glass wall providing great views of the downtown area. I will definitely stay here next time I'm in town. </DOC> I'm upgrading my review to a 5! I liked this hotel more this time around. My room was very quiet as I up higher on the 16th floor. The made to order breakfast station is a nice touch at this level of a hotel. the evening reception \"wine time\", was impressive with beer, wine, & mixed drinks. Plus you could upgrade to top shelf liquour or craft beers at the bar for an additional charge. I would give a shout out to Enrique at the bar for friendly service with a smile! My coffee maker broke and I texted the hotel at 530 in the morning and they brought one right up to me. That's service! I would definitely return to this hotel! </DOC> For 25 years (with a couple exceptions) I've stayed at the Hilton on S. Michigan during the same annual trade show. Kudos to them for making arrangements allegedly due to overbooking from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. This however is not a substitute full service hotel; it's substitute accommodations or lodging. Meh. However, if you are on a budget or per diem, you'll do well here with the complimentary breakfast and the booze and appetizers during early evening managers' reception. The third party restaurant on the ground floor is equally underwhelming. Meh, Meh. Is there really a market demand for \"all suites\" in Chicago? For what it is, it's nice, but not what I was looking for. </DOC> Great location, Whole Goods and Target literally across the street! Plus within walking distance to the Navy Pier and Michigan Ave. Free made to order breakfast. Friendly staff and great room layout selection. Pool was pretty small and the house keeping barely cleaned, more just straightened up. But overall can't complain, we got the Winter rate!! Woohoo! </DOC> For the outrageous price this inn charges for valet parking, they should at least honor specific guest requests. While checking out, we requested the car be spotted close to an entryway, and in a lighted area, because we were loading both luggage and a small child. Between trips to load the vehicle, someone took it upon themselves to move it to a remote, dark, secluded area. No apologies offered: \"Hey, we got cars to move!\" Typical Chicago!",

        "docs": "Embassy Suites Mag Mile is in a great location for all that there is to see and do in Chicago. It is a big, noisy place, built around an open center like most Embassy Suites. This trip was during the break between Christmas and New Years so it was bustling with families. No problem, because a trip to Chicago means getting out and about, not hanging around in your hotel. Be warned, at busy times, the breakfast area is complete chaos with long wait times. The breakfast room has all the elegance of a high school cafeteria. The rooms are nicely appointed, not luxurious, but well above basic. Get a corner room on a high floor and you will be treated to a beautiful, lighted city view. </DOC> This place is great, we stay here every year because we know what to expect. We have two kids, and there is no better place to stay than here with children. The kids LOVE the glass elevator views of the city. The free breakfast is better than most places you pay for breakfast. The pool is not huge, but large enough to not get crowded. The views from the bedrooms are all great. In recap, this place is a wonderful place to stay with kids. The location cannot be beat. Service and staff is all top notch! Thanks Embassy! </DOC> 20 minute wait for check-in. No complimentary offer of upgrade, despite diamond status. Digital key - could use to skip line - but need vouchers from front desk for both breakfast and evening reception. Breakfast vouchers were not in room as told by front desk lady. Room temperature had a humid feel, with lack of good AC/Heat - lot of warm air. Numerous other better options in area - Hyatt Place, Homewood Suites, Westin, Courtyards etc. in my opinion. </DOC> Located in the Magnificent Mile area. Nice facility. Good service. Standard ES breakfast offering (better variety of cut fruit like pineapple would be welcomed). Easy parking available. Evening reception was better than many ESs. Overall a good location. </DOC> We arrived very late our first night, and we were given a room with a King instead of 2 Queens. There was nothing anyone could do at the time, but the staff was very helpful to remedy this the next day. They moved all of our luggage for us into a room with 2 Queens and called to make sure everything was ok. You can\u2019t beat the free breakfast and happy hour, and this location was within walking distance to the Miracle Mile and the John Hancock building. Plenty of room in our room for a family of 5. Highly recommend! </DOC> Location and breakfast are what sets this hotel apart from others. It's 4 blocks from the Navy Pier, 2 blocks from the Magnificent Mile, and 3 blocks from the Riverwalk. Breakfast is a full buffet with made to order eggs. Beds and pillows are very comfortable. Customer service is excellent. </DOC> Large E.S. centrally located. Excellent front desk folks that were very helpful. the bar is adequate and serves food. the room was clean, had a nice view, and roomy. I was there for a large convention, but the staff handled the crowd with ease. one of my pet peeves is a multi floor hotel with too few elevators, the ones they have are snail pace slow. however, this hotel has several elevators and they are screaming fast. I wish all hotels would take this approach. I'll stay here again when in Chicago. </DOC> In all the many times I have been to Chicago I never was in this part of the area. Lots of apartments, a Target store, several hotels - $15 all day parking close by - all in all a great part of the city. Convenient to pretty much everything. Walking distance to what seems like a thousand restaurants too. This embassy suites is very good. Clean, comfortable. High speed elevators.",

My room was ready VERY early, and I was impressed with the responsiveness of the staff to my needs. Gym here is a little small for the size of the hotel, so pack a little extra time in the mornings. Room was well maintained, bed was comfortable and bathroom was spotless. Price point was good, and I'll definitely keep this high on my list. </DOC> The Embassy Suites Downtown is a great place. It is one block off of the Chicago river and one block from N. Michigan Avenue. The rooms are typical Embassy Suites. The breakfast is good, and the happy hour is one of the best in Embassy Suites. food is upgraded, and plentiful. At the start of the 2 hours you can expect a long line for drinks, but it clears out with a half hour or so. A great place for families. And, with the Whole Foods across the street, you can really make the stay easy and affordable. We always stay here, and although we had not been there in 7 months, staff actually recognized us! (and, we are not that distinctive or memorable!) Highly recommended!! </DOC> We were there with four grandchildren. The room was great for all of us. The hotel was well maintained and was very clean. The room overlooked the water and we saw fireworks one night from Navy Pier. The breakfast was good with selections for all. </DOC> Above average place to stay . . . enjoyed the breakfast & evening reception . . . helpful doorman with taxis . . . desk personnel very helpful . . . room thermostat would not go above 75, but room was cooler than that and put on jacket or sweater . . .nice to have Bellwether Restaurant on ground floor . . . would return </DOC> Visiting Chicago there are a number of hotels to stay at. I have stayed at this Embassy Suites a few times now and feel that you get good value for your money. The hotel is in good shape. Excellent breakfast included with your nightly stay (get there early as it can be crowded). Hotel is near the Pier so a good location for touring. Internet was fine for my business needs. Staff in all areas were friendly and paid attention to details. Will say here again. </DOC> I've stayed at a number of Embassy Suites, but this one was especially nice. Very spacious, room was clean and neat, and the evening beverages/morning breakfast were better than other Embassy Suites. The location is also very good both for shopping on the Magnificent Mile or enjoying the lake! </DOC> The Embassy Suites is ideally situated 1 block off of Michigan avenue and walking distance to the art museum and Navy Pier, plus many other sites. The Embassy Suites has excellent employees that really take care of you plus great spacious suites that has everything you need for a 1 night or weekend stay. </DOC> Can't go wrong with the included manager's reception each night and the cooked to order breakfast each morning. The rooms are spacious and the lobby area is beautiful. Lots of great restaurants in the area and a close walk to Navy Pier and Michigan Avenue. Not terribly close to the \"L\" but still walkable.",

The thing that I like is that there are a lot of convenient restaurants close by and only a five minute shuttle to the airport </DOC> What we enjoyed most about this hotel was the feeling of spaciousness. So used to city hotels that have that very cramped feeing. The standard room with a king bed had plenty of extra square footage to move around in easily. The floor to ceiling windows helped also. Great comfy bed and really nice linens. It probably helps that this is a fairly new building, but there was really good lighting in the room, hallways and common areas. Loved the very open lobby area. </DOC> My mother and I stayed in this hotel for one night in November 2017. Excellent service and a beautiful hotel. No complaints from us. We had breakfast twice at ETA in the hotel and also ordered room service several times. I would definitely stay here again. The rooms are spacious and luxurious. The only noise I could hear was the other doors closing in the hallway. No street noise. A very central location as well. </DOC> The hotel is fresh and well maintained. Good location a block or so off of Michigan Ave. a block from Whole Foods. Ask for a lake view room. The views are beautiful. Reasonable rates. Attentive service. </DOC> A good hotel, but nothing out of the ordinary really. Drinks were expensive, food in the restaurant ridiculously expensive, terrace bar never opened for many excuses they gave us.....room was normal, mattress sank too much. Try another hotel for less it will be as good. </DOC> Hotel is just north of river, just east of park along Columbus, so-so limited menu lunch place-ETA, but has a Starbucks and many restaurants close by. Nice large meeting rooms with coffee and cold drinks. Seems fairly new, good cleaning staff and bellmen for taxis. Only go to info booth when someone there, front desk people are not crossed trained and could not find maps or info. On/off bus stops in front of small park on Columbus. </DOC> I have stayed here for Chicago marathon for past few years and it\u2019s a perfect location. For the race and runners - 1. Starbucks in house, 2. Whole Foods across the street, 3. About 1-1.5 miles from start depending on where you start and need to go. 4. Comfy beds! 5. Gym is really nice, 6. You can run right to navy pier and go left or right on lake shore path to run/bike etc, and 7. Michigan Avenue is 0.1 miles away. Luxury and convenience!!! Staff is great also. So many great places to eat in Chicago don\u2019t eat here. </DOC> Loews Chicago is in a great location. Walking distance to Navy Pier, Magnificent Mile, shopping and restaurants. Checking in was quick and easy. Concierge was very friendly and helpful. The room was a great size. Bed was very comfortable. Large walk-in shower. Lots of shelf space in the bathroom. Room appeared to be very clean until I saw dust all over on the art piece above the bed. Then upon closer inspection of the room, the top of light fixtures were dusty as well. Looked like dusting only took place at eye level and not above. Very disappointing for a hotel the caliber of Loews.",

We had several challenges while on property which were addressed very professionally by Koba & David, on-site managers. We used Travelzoo coupons for massages. Everyone was very happy with their massages! The food in the breakfast area & bar was delicious! The bartenders and servers were wonderful!! We look forward to returning to this hotel soon. I am very impressed with the hotel's management to uphold the highest standards of customer service & would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a hotel in Chicago near Michigan Ave. </DOC> Stayed here with my husband on business. Was pleasantly surprised. Room was bigger than most and with a modern twist. No problem with elevators which is a plus even though we were in 14 floor. Ate at the ETA restaurant extremely pleased. Food was fresh and from local farms. Bar is fantastic too. Location is great and close to a lot of things. Try out core power yoga just steps away. Another great fine. Overall a great visit and wouldn\u2019t hesitate coming back to this hotel. </DOC> Arrived for a weekend and were treated amazingly. The hotel is close to the lake and overlooks Navy Pier on one side and the river on the other. Room was very comfortable and well appointed in a modern style. Full length window treatments with motorized open/close allowed us to \"fine tune\" the ambiance in the room. Free wi-fi is always a plus but the fine details of the service and room made this one of the best places I have stayed in Chicago. </DOC> I highly recommend this hotel if you\u2019re visiting Chicago for a few days. I booked a premium room and was upgraded to a corner room, which had great views of the lake and city. The hotel is two blocks from Whole Foods and a short walk to miracle mile, theatre, and all Chicago has to offer. They have a lobby bar happy hour from 8 to 9 that I highly recommend. </DOC> My husband and I just stayed overnight at the Loews Chicago Hotel. The location was perfect for our evening out at the Shakespeare Theater on Navy Pier. We were extremely lucky to be upgraded to a Chicago Suite. It really is exactly like the photos on the website. First, the suite was HUGE with an entry hall, powder room, living/dining room, kitchen with a full size refrigerator, bedroom and a master bath. The room was spotless. The view of the lake was wonderful. The bed was comfy. And, the people at the front desk were great. We just bought a condo very near the hotel so we will absolutely recommend our guests stay at the Loews. </DOC> Clean and convenient location. Loved the quick check in and out - use of technology is excellent. Staff all very good. Added a couple business meetings , lunches and breakfast - food was very good for a hotel . Meeting rooms fine etc..... Bed was fine, nicely laid out room and bath - walk in shower perfect. However- no turn down service or bottled water provided, Would I stay again - absolutely </DOC> Location is a little funky and confusing to some. The rooms were nice but the temperature control with the bedding was difficult to balance. The group food - breakfast and a banquet - was poor. The meeting area in the lobby was a nice size and the conference rooms were conveniently located. </DOC> This hotel is well located and within walking distance to navy pier and the magnificent mile. The staff were lovely and very obliging. It was spotless. I will certainly be back. Great breakfast in the restaurant too",

        "docs": "Hosted a large multi-day business conference here this week. The service was spectacular! But the check-in process was a bit clunky. The suite I had was nice but the AC unit in the living area was loud with metal vibrating noises and did not keep the room cool (assume the AC has been turned off for the year?). The first day our meeting room was disrupted by faulty projection equipment (PSAV not Loews), adjacent drilling noises (very problematic), and the room set up was wrong. From there, the conference really went pretty well, and our group of over 300 attendees liked the venue, F&B, service and location. Not sure about going back again next year without thoroughly first addressing the nickel-and-dime extra charges and the 34% upcharge on everything. </DOC> I stayed for 3 nights on business. This is a beautiful hotel and the rooms are fresh, bright and new. The style, colors and finish are all first rate. The bathroom and bed are great and the work desk had two chairs that allowed for different types of comfort for prolonged in-room work. The catering for the meeting was also great. </DOC> From the minute you walk in to the inviting lobby, you know you are going to have a great experience. Stayed in a lakeview suite which had floor to ceiling windows showing a lovely view of the lake. Decor was modern and appealing. Room was huge with a long hallway so you have wrap around views on both corners. King bed was very comfortable. Pull out sofa, could have been a little nicer, but was fine for my son. Rooftop restaurant is a lovely space in nice weather - but it is not really rooftop since it's on the 3rd floor - more like terrace top. Service was excellent. Location is nicely centered so you can walk to the navy pier or Millennium park (15 minutes). Was here for a conference and added vacation days and would note the conference space was very nice. </DOC> The hotel is beautiful and the staff was spectacular. However, the toilet seat in my room definitely needed replaced and the makeup mirror\u2019s (thank you for having one!) light did not work. It was bright enough in the bathroom that I could still do my makeup though. There is no floor length mirror which I thought was odd. I ordered room service and although the experience was great, the food was actually awful. I ended up paying $30 for a plate of French fries and a weird tasting hummus with pita wedges that were rock hard and inedible. DEFINITELY not worth the cost. </DOC> This was my third visit to the Loews in Chicago. Another great visit. This was for a conference at the hotel. The staff does a wonderful job supporting meetings. The staff is extremely friendly and help. Everyone speaks and asks if they can assist you. Catherine at the Concierge Desk is extremely help. She is full of helpful suggestions. The rooms are great. Plenty of electrical outlets. The river with a number of activities is one block away. Looking forward to visit #4. </DOC> I stayed here for 3 nights while attending a conference. Check-in was quick and friendly and service was excellent throughout the stay. The hotel and rooms are a little old. Conference facilities were quite good. The hotel is within a short walk of many good restaurants and popular Chicago spots. I would recommend and stay here again. </DOC> I have been to Chicago many times and stayed in many hotels. My stay at Loews was overall a very pleasant experience while here for a conference. The hotel is close to The Navy Pier, within walking distance (2 mi) of Shedd Acquarium and Field Museum of Natural History as well as the shops along Michigan Avenue. Perfect location! My room was comfortable, very clean and aesthetically pleasing. Towels were wonderfully plush, robes provided were amazingly soft and cozy. Room service was prompt and rooms were cleaned thoroughly. I like the fact that the remote control seemed to be cleaned daily and put into a protective case. My room had a beautiful view of the lake and Navy Pier. Even though this hotel is in a great location in one of America's largest cities, once inside the atmosphere seemed like a hotel in a much smaller city....a most welcoming atmosphere. </DOC> My wife and I stayed at the Loews for 3 great nights during May and we were thoroughly pleased with our pick. The hotel is in a great location - a short walk to the Navy Pier, the Old Street beach area, walking trails and to the main streets for shopping and restaurants. The rooms are fairly spacious, the bed is very comfortable and the bathroom was very nice. The hotel is very clean and all the staff were extremely helpful and pleasant, particularly the concierge desk who were more than helpful in helping us design out days out. I would certainly recommend staying here when in Chicago.",

        "docs": "The staff at this hotel couldn't be nicer or more helpful. When we asked for directions to the nearest train station (Hatton Cross) the gal at the front desk actually led us through the hotel grounds and out to the street to point out the building two blocks away. That is service above and beyond expectations! A very fine midlevel hotel that we enjoyed for two relaxing nights. </DOC> Our connecting flights from Edinburgh required an overnight stay and so we picked the Garden Inn for the convenience to the airport as well as London. We got the Hotel Hoppa bus (\u00a35pp) which was straightforward (if a little circuitous). The room itself was clean and fairly standard for a Garden Inn room. Wifi worked well in the room and it was surprisingly quiet with no plane noise at all. Hatton Cross tube station was only a 5minute walk away which took us to Leicester Square in about 45mins which was great. Overall, it was an ok stay, nothing flash, but comfortable enough. </DOC> We stayed here before an early morning flight. It was within walking distance of the tube station and worked perfectly for that purpose. While it seemed reasonably safe, it does feel isolated and not everyone would be comfortable walking alone in the dark to the hotel. The room was a touch small but well-appointed and comfortable. I couldn't imagine staying here for any reason other than getting close to the airport, but I'm fairly certain that's its primary purpose. </DOC> Arrived at midnight and I knew we were close to the airport but we never heard a plane. Was totally amazed when I looked out of the window the next morning and we seemed to be at the end of the runway with the planes just approaching the hotel - you absolutely cannot hear them at this hotel. The accomodations are very comfortable. You also don't hear noise in the halls or neighboring rooms. Very nice rest after traveling 7 hours on a plane. </DOC> We had a 26 hour layover so chose this hotel for the price and location. Room was comfortable and spacious. Couldn't hear outside but the hallway was a bit noisy. Breakfast was good but a bit pricey. Tube close by. Shuttle was $4.50pp and took forever to get to terminal 2. I would stay again but I'd use a cab to the airport </DOC> I stayed one night, arriving late, before an early domestic flight the following day. The hotel is easy to find from Hatton Cross tube station and is welcoming. Reception / Check-in was fine; the receptionist was a trainee so it took a little longer than usual but not uncomfortably so. The room was fine - comfortable bed, lovely sheets and a fluffy duvet. It's a pity that for an hotel so close to the airport they don't offer breakfast earlier than 6am though, meaning if you're setting of before then your compelled to breakfast at the airport. But a good nights rest and a quick and easy journey to T5 in the morning. </DOC> I think it's perfect for late night arrivals to Heathrow. Just take the Picadilly line for one stop to Hatton Cross. Rooms are nice, beds are good and breakfast is really great. The gym is also very good with free weights, machines, etc. I've stayed here a couple of times, and i will be back for sure. </DOC> This hotel is our regular resting place the night before our flight. The reception team was up to their usual very high standard, then we ate dinner in the hotel and were served by Ruth, what a delightful young lady. The food was delicious as well. One minor comment, room not the usual standard we had come to expect based on our last several visits. Also no face cloths available, however we found the room to be clean and comfortable. See you on the next trip",

        "docs": "This is an OK place to stay for an early departure from T4, much cheaper than the Hilton adjacent to T4. Decent bar, open pretty late. Room fine, but nothing in the room fridge. No robes. Be aware that there are no staff to assist with luggage, no bell boys, you have to get all your luggage to/from your room on your own. Note Uber cars won't/don't come right to the front of the hotel, (they don't want to pay the ticket barrier charge), you have to drag your stuff out to the road. So I ordered an independent taxi for an early morning journey to T4 which turned out to be \u00a320, pretty expensive for a 5 minute ride, </DOC> This hotel is very hit and miss. Sometimes you will have a great stay and everything is perfect. Sometimes it\u2019s not so good. Reception staff on the whole are good, especially Maya who is very friendly and helpful. Some of the receptionists just want to do the bare minimum and don\u2019t like putting in any effort. Rooms are clean, tidy and modern. Breakfast is sometimes good, sometimes bad. Definitely wouldn\u2019t pay the \u00a314 charge for it. Even with a late check out arranged, and a do not disturb sign on your door, housekeeping always just let themselves in shortly after 12noon. Clearly just really bad organisation. </DOC> Stayed one night. Took the free public bus here from the airport if you can manage your own luggage. Otherwise there is the airport Hoppa bus for GBP5 and a lot more for the taxi for such a short distance. The room was a reasonable enough size, clean and the beds comfortable. Staff were pleasant and friendly. </DOC> We spent two nights at this hotel after a holiday abroad. It is in a great location close to Heathrow and Hatton Cross station as we travelled in to London during our stay. We had stayed here before and the hotel looked after my triple room request again very well. The breakfast is very good and the egg station is an excellent idea. We had drinks in the bar every night and the prices are very reasonable. An excellent airport hotel and we will be back. </DOC> We booked a family room for my husband and I and my mother after flying in on a long haul flight, before connecting to a flight to Belfast the next day. The room had 2 double beds and was very spacious and had a well equipped bathroom. The buffet breakfast was excellent with a good variety of hot and cold food and compliments to the chef for the omelettes that he personally cooked for us to our individual requirements. The bar area was lovely with a good selection of bar meals on offer. The hotel is in an excellent location and has a tube station - Hatton Cross - close by for anyone who wanted to go into Central London. The hotel was very quiet, excellent sound proofing and you would not have known that the busy Heathrow airport was so close by, if it was not for the planes flying overhead. An excellent airport hotel, and one that we intend to use again. </DOC> We are regulars at this hotel and appreciate the clean functional rooms, the convenient location for the airport and the facilities (laundry etc). However the food was horrid today. My chicken wings must have been cooked days before and soaked in spicy sauce. Hope I can digest it... </DOC> Easy to find, great standards, nice rooms with a nice bar, breakfast and cafe area - nothing more you could want in an Airport hotel..... Parking is a little tight if you arrive late - but I've never failed to squeeze it in..... Lush breakfast too - and even nicer pint of Stella Artois at the bar!! </DOC> This hotel is very convenient to Heathrow. Service was very good and breakfast was of a high standard with a very god choice available. A shuttle bus connects to the various airport terminals for \u00a34.80 approx.",

        "docs": "Nice hotel very close to Hatton Cross tube station (less than 5 min walk). Ideal stay if your morning flight isn't too early (ours was 10am) and the onsite hotels are pricey. We had two rooms - twin and king = and both were nice and clean with good quality fixtures/fittings. We had snacks in the bar and some drinks, which was a nice sociable area. Breakfast in the morning was plentiful. We had a taxi in the morning booked by hotel (had a lovely car with friendly driver cost \u00a316). Would gladly stay here again when on site hilton is too pricey. </DOC> Second time here previously stayed when it was Jury's Inn. Decent sized room with safe and tea making facs and free wifi. I had a restful sleep and it is so well glazed there is no sound from aircraft overhead, even with a good view down runway 27L. Bit of a mix up at breakfast as the table I was allocated was pinched by someone else whilst I collected my buffet breakfast. Then when I went to get more tea the table was cleared before I had finished, such is the turn round of customers. When I explained this to the maitre D he waived my \u00a315 charge, so a good result really. Handy also for shuttle bus to T5. </DOC> You can reach this hotel from LHR by taking tube to Hatton Cross station, just 1-2 stops depending on terminal. From Hatton Cross hotel is about 5-10 min walk away. Also Hatton Cross station has stairs only so not a great option if you have heavy luggage. Another option is the LHR Hoppa bus, but service is not that frequent and long wait time not necessarily justified. Hotel itself is very busy, catering many airlines as well. All rooms are standard size, and in general ok. Elevators seem to be a bottle neck during morning rush hours. Hotel has nothing exciting around the surroundings. Some good 20 min walk away there is a Tesco Superstore. Otherwise the best option is to jump into Piccadilly tube and ride towards the London city. </DOC> I travel every week across the UK and this is one of my top 5 favourite hotels - why you may ask ... because the brand always delivers a consistent standard - pleasant reception area, welcome greeting, efficient check-in and clean, well appointed rooms with a safe communal area - even for lone travellers. The restaurant is of a good standard and the breakfast is the best on offer in my opinion. So what could be improved? Sound insulation if you have an adjoining room - you can hear everything going on in the next room so be warned! Bring ear-plugs if you are a light sleeper like me. However, I always thoroughly enjoy my stay and feel the other areas make up for the small design fault of the building. </DOC> A very pleasant and efficient stay. Comfortable room, breakfast and dinner were fine. Good internet connection. Hopper bus ok for arrival but full on departure so had to legit to the tube. Not the hotels problem but do keep this in mind if you have baggage. No lifts st Hatton Cross Station </DOC> This was a great hotel, it suited all my needs while in London for two nights in May. The primary reason I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn was the close proximity of Heathrow Airport and the Underground. The beds were comfortable, the bathroom clean and modern, the Wi-Fi was fast, and the price was reasonable. I paid for the breakfast buffet which I felt was expensive, however the food choices were plentiful and of high quality, and I was impressed with the omelette to order. The Underground Hatton Cross Station is a five minute walk from the hotel and one station away from Heathrow on the Piccadilly line. Although the hotel is close to Heathrow, I didn\u2019t hear any air traffic noise. I would have no problem recommending the Hilton Garden Inn to family and friends. </DOC> I attended a client meeting, attended by around 30 people. The meeting room was in a building that was seperate from the main hotel, located behind it. The room was a good size, there was tea and coffee on tap all day and the room was perfect. </DOC> Liked the Hilton Garden Inn we stayed in st Heathrow. It was modern, well appointed, great service and well taken care of. If anything the guest rooms were a little small. They had two doubles which is better than most Uk hotels but not the US where there is often a King bed choice.",

Staff at this property are geared toward group guests and requests. It's a s </DOC> First timer. Separate rooms for friend and I. Excellent sound proofing with a spotless room. Upgraded as a lowly silver to a king bed. A very firm mattress suited me. An informal restaurant serving solid mains at circa \u00a315. A little sting in the tale...A cab that the hotel called to get us to Terminal 3 charged us \u00a322...Maybe an exec company.. but left a bad taste for what was a maybe 10 minute drive. </DOC> Stay at this hotel for early morning flight. It was great hotel. The staff was well trained so check in was easy. The room was spacious and clean. Enjoyed our stay. The breakfast was very good and worth my stay before my flight </DOC> yes, this is the place to stay when you need to leave from the Heathrow Airport the next morning. they do have a bus (you buy the ticket at the hotel) that will take you to the airport. the breakfast area was very clean and hot food. the rooms were comfortable and clean. very simple rooms. it has a bar/restaurant open until late at night, so it was good to get a drink, burger and fries. the windows are double glass ,so you really don't hear the noise from the airplanes at the airport. the bus do stop in other hotels, so it does not go directly to the airport from there. so make sure that you let yourself enough time to get to the airport. the front desk staff are very professional and very friendly. </DOC> We stayed here for one night for the rugby at Twickenham. From start to finish the staff at this hotel were superb and everyone in our party commented on the customer service and the number of staff on duty. The hotel was well equipped to deal with a busy level of guests - plenty of people on the bar, in the restaurant and on reception. We opted for \u00a312 breakfast and \u00a319.95 3 course dinner - amazing amazing amazing - very good value for money. Parking is also good value for money \u00a312 for a day as a guest but if you want to travel into London or anywhere there is a tube station just 2 minutes walk away - Hatton Cross. We travelled to the hotel from central London without an issue. Excellent hotel - one of the best in the area. </DOC> Great comfortable lobby with lots of seating areas. Super staff; knowledgeable & friendly. Clean, efficient rooms. 7 minute walk to Greenman Pub. 10 minute walk to subway station. Took hoppa bus to airport - 5 pounds. </DOC> I don't know why I continue to stay in Hiltons when it seems every review I do for them is not good. I stayed in this one as it was by the hotel and we had a morning flight and the room had space for 2 adults and a 4 year old. You have to pay 9 pounds to park. We booked a room for 2 adults and a 4 year old and the bathroom had one towel. (seriously). They were prompt about bringing more when I called down. There were no carts to carry luggage. Room was small but most in Europe seem to be. We had to rush grabbing breakfast so I cannot really comment on it. One room key given did not initially work. Please try harder Hilton or I will just use only IHG. I'm tired of writing bad reviews on these Hilton hotels. </DOC> A really good airport hotel. Seems to have been completely refurbed following its conversion from Jury's. Front desk staff were very friendly and helpful, bar and waiting staff the same. Room was immaculate. There is a Hoppa bus service from the front door to the airport so very convenient.",

Staff attentive and food was luscious. Will visit again. </DOC> Stayed here for one night before flying out early the next morning. The hotel itself was great, with good clean rooms and comfortable beds. The only issue was getting to and from the hotel. The hoppa bus only runs for a few hours in the morning and the afternoon and goes once an hour. I ended up in a taxi costing \u00a310. </DOC> Stayed here for an extended layover so that I could explore the city a bit. The airport is very large so the hotel is unlikely to be within walking distance of your terminal if you are hoping for that. My taxi fare from the terminal to the hotel was 20\u00a3 but only took 10 minutes or so. The location is wonderfully close to the tube and for 5\u00a3 you can very easily get to Piccadilly Circus. That came in very handy. The staff was helpful in checking me in early but I did have to pay for a room upgrade to do so. There is a restaurant and coffee shop on site. The room is clean and fresh in appearance. However the towels are falling apart and there was no extra blanket for the bed. </DOC> Close to Heathrow. Comfortable room - great place to stay when you're flying out in the morning. Restaurant staff needs some work - for example - when two people are dining together, you don't deliver meals 30 minutes apart. But they did do it over and didn't charge since they got it so very wrong. </DOC> Used hotel as a base to attend football at nearby Brentford. As ever Hotel was clean, warm and staff friendly. Cannot fault the location or hotel. C u again soon. Nothing is too much for the staff at this hotel. It\u2019s our first choice when visiting London. </DOC> Although very close to London Heathrow Airport, the sleeping room, which faced the runways was very quiet so sleeping was no problem. The room itself was very clean, comfortable with all necessary features. Check-in and the main dining room left nothing to be desired. There was just one slight niggle and that was the casual and indifferent service in the bar area during the afternoon. I had to seek staff help from another part of their operation to initiate service. Getting to the hotel from LHR was easy by taking the tube one stop except for one thing, there is no lift(elevator) at Hatton Cross' tube station which is needed if one has heavy luggage. But I would certainly stay at this hotel again. </DOC> Outstanding Hilton property extremely close (convenient) to LHR and very convenient to Underground station (5 minute walk). Extremely clean, safe feeling and each guest treated as a Diamond member. Rooms were quiet and provided superior double pane windows for noise supression and good nights sleep. Every Staff member, including front desk supervisor from Napal, all the Romanians in dining and our housekeeping staff were professional, attentive and a joy to work with. </DOC> We stayed here because we were flying back from the U.K. to the U.S. and had a morning flight. Rather than have an hour trek from Central London, we booked 2 rooms for our family of 5. The shuttle is 5 pounds per person for the 5 minute conveyance across the freeway. A taxi was cheaper, so we ended up going that route and then could go when we wanted. (The shuttle only ran at 6 am and 7 am, sort of a gap.). Our rooms were fine, and bigger than a regular central London room, but our drains in the bathroom made this horrible gurgling noise that lasted about 60 seconds after using the tap or flushing. The restaurant was pretty good, though, surprisingly.",

Very comfy king size bed and Incredibly little aircraft noise given how close we were to the runways! You can hear sounds from adjacent rooms, however, but nothing particularly disturbed us. It is a 5 minute walk to Hatton Cross station and one stop to T3 but we got a taxi for \u00a312 ( for the 10-15 minute journey). </DOC> A good spot for our overnight given its location one tube stop from the airport along the main Piccadilly line. We\u2019ve stayed here several times previously, and they\u2019ve renovated since our previous visit. This time we were assigned a king room on the 7th floor. As usual, the windows are great at keeping sound out, and the room is comfortablefor an overnight. This time we tried the breakfast buffet, and it was quite good with a range of hot and cold items. Overall a nice stay, and we'd return. </DOC> Very grateful to find this hotel just one stop from Terminal 3 on the Piccadilly Line to Hatton Cross, which took all of 3 minutes on the Tube. The room was spotless, the bathroom glistened cleaner that mine at home. Fara at Reception was fast, efficient and above all, welcoming. For 69 pounds you can't go wrong. For 14 pounds you get a slamming buffet breakfast before your flight. Could not here the planes overhead. </DOC> I really liked this hotel. It was clean, modern and comfortable. Rooms were very quiet despite being super close to the airport. The gym is good - had sufficient treadmills, free weights and a machine and water/towels freely provided. Room was comfortable. Note that there are free local buses running around Heathrow Airport - use google to check the numbers. These buses serve all airport terminals, are very frequent (maybe every 10 mins depending on day and time) and stop right outside the hotel. Don't be a sucker for the Heathrow Hopper bus service!! </DOC> It was my second stay at this hotel within a year. I needed a place close to Heathrow for a night as I was flying out early. I also like the hotel because it's walking distance from the the Hatton Cross station (service to Heathrow and London on the Piccadilly line). Not much around so grab food from elsewhere otherwise you're stuck with the hotel restaurant. I had to change my flight home due to weather so I went to the front desk to extend my stay by one night. Done. I would stay here again if I have to fly out of Heathrow in the early morning. </DOC> Stayed at the hotel recently before an mid morning flight the next day. Great value - well priced as it was a Saturday night. Not much around the hotel but there are plenty of bars / restaurants in Hounslow - a few stops on the tube away. Hatton Cross is 5 mins away and great for the airport. You can walk to the bus station there and get a FREE bus to the airport as within the free zone. Very comfortable double bed. Highly recommend and will use again if I have an early flight. </DOC> We stayed here for a night since we had early flights out of Heathrow, which is one stop off the Piccadilly line. It's clean and staff seem nice. Free WIFI is appreciated. The hotel isn't near other restaurants so we had dinner at the hotel restaurant but service was slow. </DOC> A very enjoyable stay before a flight from terminal 3. Only a short walk from Hatton Cross Underground station. Clean, tidy rooms, obviously not as plush as a standard Hilton hotel but very good for the price. The breakfast was also well varied and hot \ud83d\ude03 would return",

We had dinner and breakfast at the Hotel and we found the dinner uninspiring however the breakfast was spot on given there was no table service . There was a reasonable selection of hot and cold dishes. Lets not forget that this is a 3 star hotel so our expectations were more than met . The location was superb. We used SIXT rental cars right next door to the Tube station. It's not a Sofitel or Marriott but more than adequate for the moment. </DOC> Came here by tube to Hatton Cross underground. The hotel is about five minute away on foot. The downside is crossing a footbridge. However there is a bus (\u00a34.50) to the airport from the hotel every hour. Rooms were nice, the restaurant on site was good and relatively inexpensive. The staff were helpful with photocopying a document for me, and printing my boarding pass. Availability of the 'Daily Telegraph' was a nice additional perk. This is a cheaper version to staying on the airport concourse itself. Warmly recommend it. </DOC> This hotel is not as convenient to LHR as some of the other airport hotels, but at half the price, it was worth the distance. Hotel can be accessed by means of the hotel hoppa bus or the tube to Hatten Cross station, either is less than 5 pounds. Reception was friendly and helpful. Lobby/Pub/coffee area were welcoming. Food service continues in the pub for an hour or so after the restaurant closes. Small shop has some food/drinks, including some microwavable food (and there is a microwave). Room was decent sized and clean. Bathtub was very shallow. </DOC> This s a nice hotel, contemporary decorations, Easy free bus ride to and from the airport, Shuttle available as well for a fee, note that the bus stop is a 4 minute walk from the front door, Good breakfast - Nice choices </DOC> The aim was to avoid driving through the night; stresses of rushing to make check-in; and get some sleep ahead of a long days travel. HGI is fantastically quiet despite being next to one of the worlds busiest runways & delivered a calming 7 hours sleep and a superbly quick transfer to T2 for 0530. I would recommend the hotel every time - comfortable, superb, quiet, close. </DOC> I chose this hotel because it was close to terminal 4. When I checked on I booked the taxi for the following morning, which was on time and the driver was great. Check in was quick and pleasant at the hotel. The staff are very courteous. We had a meal in the restaurant and it was good and the waitress was very helpful. The room was comfortable and we woke refreshed ready for our flight. Overall it was a very good experience and we will not hesitate to return to this hotel. </DOC> Stayed for 2 nights on business in the Slough area - so decided to stay at Heathrow. I've stayed before when this hotel was Jury's Inn & the makeover is a definite improvement. Location is good for access to M4, A4 etc and enough parking at a reasonable price \u00a38 overnight. Rooms are good quality, quiet and comfortable beds and decent air con. Breakfast was reasonable enough for what I required. Evening meals in the bar were limited but ok for money paid. Reception were the poorest part of the hotel very little interaction and I didn't get any welcome as hhonors member either at check in or check out - which Hilton family hotels are usually pretty good at. Would still return again if require that location at a good price. </DOC> Very close to Heathrow yet we did not hear the planes passing overhead. Room clean and comfortable. Good quality bedlinen. We did not take breakfast as we had an early departure. Our room (252) was partially disabled friendly but oddly the shower was over the bath. Free WiFi.",

A covered way would be nice, it is Ireland. Room as expected , nice touch is the blue light for night time bathroom visits.The breakfast is complementary, charge and make it better. It is not a good start for our friends making long haul flights across the Atlantic. Poor little choice fried breakfast. The evening meal next door in the Crown restaurant though was wonderful. We had many excellent meals in Ireland this was one of the best. </DOC> I picked the location based on proximity to the airport and price. The rooms themselves are very basic, but are comfortable and provide everything you need. There is a bar/lounge area where you can order food, drinks and watch telly. Breakfast is free and DELICOUS, be still my heart Irish sausage. There is plenty of info on nearby transportation in and around Dublin and local attractions. The airport shuttle is free and gets you there within 10 minutes and runs on a regular basis. Bus stops to Dublin are nearby and you can be in the city center within 20 minutes. I must give a shout-out to Colin at the front desk, who was very helpful and charming. </DOC> We choose this hotel purely based on the location to Dublin airport and because they had a free shuttle. Our room was nice, clean and the bed was very comfortable.The breakfast which is included in the price was excellent. The hotel doesn't really have a lot around it so there is not much selection in terms of food options. Staff were pleasant and professional. </DOC> This was our last stop on a 2 week tour of Ireland. It was far from the best lodging we had, but it was perfect for us to spend the night before our flight home. The decor is spartan, but adequate for a good night's sleep. The bed was comfortable and it had a nice workdesk. It helps that they have a large parking garage next door and a Crown Plaza on the other side which brings a nice Asian restaurant into the deal. I'd certainly consider staying here again. </DOC> It is located nearby the Dublin airport so it is suitable for travelers who need to just spend a night. The advertised airport shuttle is not clearly described as it is run by the adjacent crown plaza with no clear description of how to get it. I had to take a taxi in both ways as it was not reliable. The staff re very friendly and helpful. </DOC> Nice basic hotel with a shuttle bus to take you to the airport. There is a convenient bus stop around the corner to take you into town- the 33 is the quickest. Everything was great and would've given a higher review if the bed was more comfortable. Other than that is was perfect for our stay! I will stay there again! </DOC> The holiday inn express is next door to the crowne plaza at Dublin airport. Indeed it is possible to charge items to your room at the CP when staying at the HIX. The hotel was cleAn and comfortable and the staff friendly and efficient. My main complaint is simply that Dublin Hotels are ridiculously over priced and that was before the devaluation of the pound which now makes them unaffordable. That however is not the fault of hotels but will make visiting more difficult. </DOC> I should have known, I've never gotten a good night's sleep at a holiday inn and this one is no different. The floor was softer than the so-called mattress. The sink promised good water pressure and the shower failed to deliver. I won't make this mistake again.",

Hotel needs a major investment in updating and modernizing. Its age shows - ice machines that don't work, staff that don't seem to care. I'll find another hotel next time round! </DOC> Most probably the better choice than one of the airport hotels and travel time is really negligible. The nearby park allows to go for a decent run as the hotel lacks, the only reason why I would think twice in the future of staying again there, a gym. Breakfast, limited choice, is good. Some of the personnel in the morning was, on the morning of my stay, really busy filling up coffee cups and more or less monopolising the coffe makers. Maybe management should provide them with an own coffee maker......it is something marginal but nevertheless.... Transfer from the APT to the hotel by shuttle works well and is frequent. A shopping center is located within a 30 minutes walk. </DOC> Modern and clean with a breakfast buffet. They also have a bar, unusual compared to the Holiday Inn Express properties I have frequented in the USA. The breakfast buffet is very good. The airport shuttle is convenient. </DOC> Great hotel. Definitely worth a stay. Extending being built and refurb due soon to make it even better. Great staff that make every aspect of what you need easy to achieve. Colm runs a good ship with some great check in staff. </DOC> 137 euro one night B&B + 6 parking. Best value we could get at this peak time. Our previous usual airport hotel wanted more. Quiet sleep, good breakfast, pricey but still less expensive than competitors at peak season. No restaurant; there is one in the sister hotel next door. Pity there is no covered walkway to get next door but the reception kindly provided an umbrella. </DOC> Was impressed with the hotel and staff on my first visit and they did not disappoint this time. Very friendly and fast check-in. Good breakfast and smiles all round. We had issues with our in-room hair dryer and was resolved in minutes. My wife had a cold on our last day and a quick request was all that it took to receive an especially late check-out, and word to the staff not to disturb her all day. Was a huge help to us. Considering the location and price, is a top value in Dublin. See you again! </DOC> The Premium Inn is a typical airport hotel. Most guests stay one night between flights, meaning that there is a rapid turnover of people using its rooms. The rooms are adequate and given most guests are staying only one night, they are fit for purpose. The staff are very helpful. The Premium Inn is close to Dublin Airport, but there is no way you could get there without a shuttle or a taxi. The hotel has a bar and a restaurant. Guests can choose an optional continental breakfast or a traditional Irish cooked breakfast. </DOC> Stayed here as it was at the tail end of our trip and we had an early flight home, the next morning. Got there later, as we had spent the day walking Dublin. Dog tired and hungry, the staff was pleasant and efficient. On asking about food, was told could eat at Crowne Plaza next door and charge to room. That was fine as easy was all we wanted. Bed was comfortable enough and the room cool enough for a decent night sleep. Breakfast was sufficient if not interesting and the rate was fair.",

The weather was cold and the waiting area for the shuttle bus at the airport is exposed, but can't argue with free. Staff was cordial and professional and the room was clean. I would stay here again and recommend to a friend. </DOC> The hotel has a very convenient complimentary shuttle bus to the airport which is very frequent and convenient and takes about 10mins. The walk from T2 to the shuttle is fairly long but covered. The hotel is a typical holiday inn standard with comfortable rooms and breakfast included. The crown plaza hotel shares the same site and has a nice bar and good restaurant. We stayed two nights on a flight stopover and the local buses stop near the hotel and takes about 35mins to get into the city Center but is frequent and only 3 Euro. A good stopover if using the airport. </DOC> Like most people who stay here, we simply needed a clean, decent place to stay near the airport with a shuttle and access to a restaurant. This Holiday Inn Exprss met all of the qualifications. The hotel is a modern one. The Rome are basic, nothing fancy, but clean and modern with modern bathroom fixtures. The shower we had was larger than some others hours we used over the three weeks we were in Ireland. Our room had twin beds, and one of them was pretty close to the desk, but still workable. We used the free airport shuttle twice, and it was punctual both times. There is a restaurant a pub and a bar next door at the Crowne Plaza, and a bar off the lobby in the Holiday Inn Express. If I were passing through again, I would stay here again. </DOC> With a free shuttle from the airport and about 20 minutes from the heart of Dublin, this is a terrific option for many reasons. Admittedly, I was ready to dislike the hotel based on first impression as the common areas were packed as we arrived and the in-room amenities are sparse even by 'express' standards. HOWEVER, the walls are plenty thick enough to limit the noise, the staff was hugely helpful and friendly, the breakfast was fresh and plentiful and (this turned out to be a big deal) the rooms have aircon. Friends on the same trip but at a much pricier and upscale location roasted all week as aircon is fairly rare in Dublin we were told. All this for about half of the price of similar downtown hotels or AirBnB. Hard to imagine a better value. </DOC> If you are transferring to airport for the next day, maybe you can put up with the size and facilities of the property. Otherwise, skip this. The shuttle is working timely every 30 mins, and it is free. The room and bathroom is small, with no place to open the luggage. (well, if you open the bag, you won't be able to walk.) We stayed in the larger size room. Our other room was smaller, and it is cramp if you have 3 persons in there. The price isn't too cheap compares to the Hilton. But it provides the breakfast, and wifi isn't too slow. So good for one night before the departure. </DOC> Friendly staff at checkin, comfy bed, wake up call & free shuttle to & from the airport. Can't comment on price as I normally wouldn't stay near an airport, but they & next door have a captive audience. Also offer a breakfast pack if leaving early. </DOC> This hotel has a shuttle from the airport. After a good breakfast (included in price) you can walk down the street to the bus stop that takes you to the center of town. Three euros Do not need to rent a car. Plus parking downtown and driving is difficult. A short free trip back to the airport when it is time to go home. Room large, crown plaza hotel with restaurant next door.",

Rooms were clean, quiet with great service. Self Park $10 per night Valet $20+ per night </DOC> Stayed here recently prior to a cruise.

Bar and dinner staff were pleasant and accommodating. Food was a little better than average and certainly better than a lot of airport food. Hotel is very convenient for airport travel with the tram stop off the main lobby. Would highly recommend. </DOC> Easily accessed from the various terminals at Houston airport by a small monorail system you arrive at the centre of the web of concentric circles of rooms that comprise this low storey modern purpose built airport hotel. Once you work out how to get to your part of the web I found the well appointed room to be both spacious and functional; the bathroom had large walk in shower, white towels and double ply toilet paper! Stayed 2 nights here for client meetings with participants flying in from three other cities; the large public spaces around the central lobby, and the large bar and restaurant area (with vast number of TVs on dozens of different channels!) enabled us to easily host both meetings and meals with clients. Pleased to say my faith in North American hotel chains was restored with this positive experience with Marriott. </DOC> This is a great option for anyone needing a hotel convenient to IAH. It is just a short (albeit strange) underground train ride away. The lobby is spacious and friendly. Service was excellent- especially in the bar/restaurant. Rooms and updated and modern.

The room was very nice, even if I just passed out upon arrival. This had the best concierge breakfast out of all of the Marriott hotels that I have stayed. I would try to stay here more often. </DOC> I spent two nights at this hotel to make airport transfers simple. It certainly achieved that goal. Uber to had from Houston was easy and economical. The subway to and from the terminal is quick and easy. Signs for the subway said it did not run from 12:30-3:30 but others have mentioned that it stops much earlier than that. It is easily doable to walk but I would not recommend that late at night. I found the hotel common areas to be quite dark, the room was good, hallways a bit dated. The pool area looked nice. The best part of the hotel was the M lounge. Definitely the best breakfast I have had at a Marriott. The food was fresh and the chef offered to make omelets to order. If traveling through IAH this hotel is a great choice. </DOC> We choose this hotel because of the location. We turned the car in and stayed the night before our flight. I think there is parking but for a fee. Great sized rooms and very clean. Quick check-in. Tram to all airport terminals. Enjoyed our stay </DOC> Nice assortment of immendites.

Was warmly greeted. Quick check in process. Clean, comfortable, cold AC and quite. Perfect for a long layover. If you are wavering between a cheaper choice I would recommend the hotel, you get what you pay for and I was happy I choose this Marriott. </DOC> The hotel is inside the hotel between terminals. Note however if you arrive past 12:30am at night, the tram is not running and you have to walk the 1/2 mile inside the airport to the hotel entrance. Nice rooms. Maybe a little more expensive than outside the hotels but super convenient. </DOC> Overnight stay after missing a flight. Helpful and friendly front desk staff. Comfortable room, clean, quiet, usual amenities for a business traveler except for no desk. The bed was comfortable but the pillows were small. The lobby area was spacious and the M2 lounge was excellent. </DOC> We stayed here for one night as we had an early flight out of IAH in the morning. It's a huge hotel, and very busy, but the staff were friendly and welcoming. My room was a good size, and comfortable. There's a little underground train that takes you straight into the terminal building so it's very easy to get in/out. And, despite being so close to the airport that i could see two terminals from my window, it was very quiet. I'd happily stay here again. </DOC> We had an overnight layover and stayed here one night before heading on. The people mover is convenient and easy. Just down the stairs on to the tram/train and a minute later your at the hotel. Up the stairs to the front desk where we were greeted warmly and efficiently. Received our key, cold drink and a bottle of water. Our room was clean and bed comfy. In the morning reverse trip and in a few minutes at the gate. Couldn't have asked for more! </DOC> When I heard that I was booked at a hotel between terminals at IAH I was not thrilled. When I saw the circular 1970 era building I was even less hopeful that I would get a good nights rest. Wow, was I ever wrong. This place is lovely, wonderfully remodeled. Clean, modern, amazing customer service. The restaurant thriving and a great meeting place. Very comfortable. Tip the north, round part of the hotel has four spokes. They are color coded to help you get oriented and of course the room numbers are posted. Enjoy! I look forward to returning.",

You just take the train The hotel is between terminal C and D Easy access We had a lot of luggage. So we just brought the luggage carts all the way to room. It was not crowded on train so made it easy. However if it is crowded day then i recommend walking between terminals. It is a little longer. But will still work. </DOC> If you are stuck at the Houston Intercontinental airport this is the place to stay. Also fi you have an early morning departure - you never have to leave the airport building . Yu are inside the entire commute to the gate with the tram system </DOC> I stay in a LOT of hotels, mostly Marriott brand, so I know whats average and what exceeds. This property was completely redone last year. Not a partial redo where they put in new carpet and beds, this looks to be a nearly total gut job. Everything is new. The room was the new Marriott layout / colors without a desk which leaves it feeling very open and airy. The bed was very comfortable though the pillows were a bit thick for my linking. The windows were quite soundproof despite the fact I can see airplanes about 100 yards away. The bathroom was small but functional. The bar / restaurant in the lobby was exceptional. The staff were awesome even though it was crazy busy. The food (I had a Cobb salad) was very fresh and inexpensive. Overall a real gem here. I'd stay again! </DOC> Hotel is in a great location for everything at IAH airport, there's a small train that will take you to your ticket counter. The hotel has a great bar and restaurant in the lobby.. Handicapped rooms are large and easy to get from bed to bathroom. The one downside to the rooms are the long hallways that you must use to get to all the rooms. </DOC> If you're don't need to travel too far from the airport, this is a great location, only a few minutes walking to the terminal or by the tram. Upon entering, I thought this would be an overused airport location but it turns out the rooms were modern, fresh and spacious with a corner couch. The gym was nice, spacious and had a lot of equipment and space which is always appreciated. The M club is standard like many others around the country. Food in the restaurant had a good selection and because there's not much around, this was a good option for dinner. </DOC> I stayed prior to an early flight the next day. Found the rooms to be nice size, clean and modern. Wi-fi worked well. Barbeque meal at the restaurant was excellent; well above what I expected from a hotel restaurant. </DOC> Very comfortable room, well maintained & updated! Beds were great, sheets brand new! Shower was great too!! Only drawback for me was the absence of a mini fridge, which is huge for me as I carry lots of travel snacks, etc. highly recommend this hotel!! </DOC> I stayed twice during a recent trip to the States first after a transatlantic flight and then before the return flight. I made a great break before a second onward domestic flight. Directly linked to the airport by an underground transit system, the hotel is super easy to get to. The welcome was great and I quickly in my room. The part of the hotel I was in was circular and finding the room was interesting - a case of walking in a circle , needless to say i went the long way around. Rooms were spacious and had the usual comfortable Marriott bed. On both occasions I slept extremely well which is exactly what you want from a hotel.",

Just tired -could use painting,etc to keep it updated Friendly people The onerous Historic tax on EVERYTHING ( 6 1/2 percent plus 22 percent service charge. I hate to be nickel and dimes anywhere anytime. At Yarid\u2019s shoe store( which is my favorite all time)? Really Nice breakfast They did a nice job with a huge banquet Full house so hard to get a seat at the pool I was just back with friends for lunch\u2014Sam Snead\u2019s Friendly people very limited menu took forever( and I like to take time over meals) Was told down town that shops have limited inventory because bills aren\u2019t paid That said, it is a special place but my overall feeling is that they need some cash </DOC> This place is famous for a reason, it is simply amazing in every way. The accommodations are wonderful, service is impeccable, and food is outstanding. Be prepared to pay as everything is expensive, but you have to know that going in. On site there is bowling, hiking, golfing, a casino, riding and lots of other options. But its natural beauty is enough to simply enjoy without having to stay busy. </DOC> The best mattress we\u2019ve ever had in a hotel. The linens were luxe. It was a huge corner room with lots of light and pretty wallpaper. The dressing room was fully equipped with clothes brush, shoe horn, etc. The food and service at the meals was excellent. </DOC> First of all this the best resort in the World. Their is no other resort like this one. Second the rooms are lovely. Third there is. Zero entry infinity pool. Which has breathtaking views of the mountains. Third they make a fuss over their guest. Fourth this a very charming place. Last I would love to go back. </DOC> My wife and I along with 3 other couples in our 20 year travel org., stayed 4 nights recently at the Greenbrier and loved it! There are so many reasons why the Greenbrier is a 5 star resort so here are a few of those best reasons: Superb service. Varied and excellent dining options - 44 West, The Forum, Main dining room for buffet breakfast, Drapers & Sam Sneads for lunch. The Bunker Tour - amazing. Don't miss it! Beautiful historical and spacious spaces throughout the property. Gorgeous grounds and landscaping. Numerous hiking trails - the Valley View trail is quite pleasant, easy and close to the hotel. Rooms- quite spacious, well equipped with comfortable beds and numerous choices. The Greenbrier is truly a 5 Star Golden Gem you should definitely visit. It is very much worth every very expensive minute you will spend there. Enjoy! </DOC> Always a pleasure to stay here. The rooms are well-appointed and comfortable. Being at the Greenbrier is a traditional luxury experience. A highlight is the fantastic buffet breakfast in the main dining room. The staff are always so accommodating. </DOC> A visit here is always a unique experience, save for the last visit. It's all about color. Only the other Dorothy Draper-Carlton Varney grand hotel, the Grand on Mackinac Island in Michigan have as much color. It's all around, the flowers inside and other, the public spaces, the eateries and last but not least the guest rooms. Color, especially vibrant colors like those at the GB lift the soul, wake up the brain and warm the heart. The grounds are lush and spectacular. The rooms are so beautiful one might want to spend their entire stay in the guest room, if not there was so much else to enjoy. </DOC> Fantastic historic tour of the basement US Govt. bunker intended to house the Congress if needed during the Cold War. Very interesting however leave your camera and cell phone behind for this declassified location. Well worth the visit.",

        "docs": "One of the most beautiful luxury hotels in the U.S. Lots of history too and a hidden bunker that is worth visiting. This is a very large property that will take several days to see everything the Green brian has to offer. Of course, there is golf for which the Greenbrier is famous. the hotel is handi-friendly in every way. </DOC> We haven't been to the resort in several years. That is a mistake. We travel all over the world and this is one of my favorite resorts anywhere. The grand decor, the service, the amenities, and the beautiful setting is perfect. We were only here one night, but I wish it had been longer. We did enjoy walking the grounds, playing shuffle board, playing pool, and having good meals. I highly recommend this resort. We will be back. </DOC> We enjoyed our two nights at the Greenbrier. This is a large (i think 700 rooms) historic hotel. It has 7-8 restaurants, indoor pool, outdoor pool, gym, casino, and a bunch of shops. The decor is really colorful and flowery. We reserved a Paradise cottage which are some of the oldest rooms left. Our cottage was a den and bedroom and offered plenty of room. The room was quiet with a comfortable bed.... and offered great sleeping. The staff is processional and helpful. Some of the facilities are spread out but if you do not want to walk they have vans to transport you. They have a large amount of activities to enjoy while you are staying. We enjoyed the outdoor pool and also a bunker tour. </DOC> The Greenbrier is unique. Stepping back into more formal times, the resort offers refined dining and good entertainment. The dress code is strict by today's standards, but it is entirely consistent with the resort's focus on elegance. There are plenty of activities for everyone and beautiful grounds to stroll. The staff is friendly and professional. The only improvement we would suggest is a lower calorie dining option. </DOC> We spend time at both the Greenbrier and Homestead Resorts. We found the staff at the Greenbrier friendlier than usual and the resort was very well maintained. You did not have the feeling of faded elegance or that it\u2019s better days were behind them. We were there on a Holiday weekend and there were many children which we had not seen before. We enjoyed having them around, but it did change the atmosphere a little - especially at tea time which became a little bit of a free for all. But, that would be the only negative thing to say and we decided to leave because a cookie was not that important. I would certainly stay again - and I will. </DOC> My wife and I went with our dinner-dance group, Pavane, for our annual out-of-town event. We have been to The Greenbrier before but it had been several years since we had the pleasure to enjoy this classic resort. It gets better and better every time. The decor had been updated and spiffed-up and was very nice. The staff was superb and the epitome of hospitality. We had banquet food served for our dinner and the tenderloin and shrimp were very good. We were just sorry we did not have more time to enjoy more of the various activities and options. We had a very good time and are already talking about a return visit soon. </DOC> We did not have time to spend the night but spent the day walking around the property and having lunch at Drapers in the hotel. I had always wanted to see the interior design of the hotel by Dorothy Draper which is unique. I would like to return and spend a few days; the resort area dates from the late 1700s when historic people visited the area for the cool weather in the summer; there is a 1940's underground bunker built to house Congress and other government officials in the case of emergency during war time; you can take a tour of the bunker whose existence was unknown until the 1990s. </DOC> We had a late lunch here and it was a fun atmosphere and good food. It also a fun ice cream bar. Would recommend with children.",

The room looked like they were recently refurbished....very clean...sparkling shower....comfortable bed. They also had several USB ports for charging electronics....usually it is a hunt to find an outlet....here there were a few conveniently placed and a Keurig coffee maker. The hotel is also within walking distance to shops and restaurants. Lots to do in the area...don't miss the Buffalo Bill Center ! </DOC> We spent one night here and experienced no problems. The rooms were clean, wifi was not fast but acceptable for a hotel. The wait staff at the restaurant was friendly and the food was good. The layout of the hotel was such that it was a long walk from the room to the restaurant. </DOC> We have stayed at hundreds of hotels over the last few years. This hotel is a good place to stay but nothing special. The positives: clean property and room, good room lighting, guest laundry, close to town, large room, quiet room, large HDTV with HD signal, good wifi, quick elevator. The negatives: weak water pressure in shower, large property in busy part of town, gets a lot of tour busses( there were 3 the night we stayed), poor parking with little space for getting around, especially with the large vehicles everyone seems to drive nowadays( and I watched the very large tour busses whip through the parking lot squeezing by the parked cars nearly sideswiping them-not good...), breakfast not included, room overpriced at $217 for a night's stay but all these average hotels are charging these inflated prices. </DOC> We stayed here one night on a Gate 1 National Parks tour. Our room was fairly large with two comfortable beds. It is a short walk to downtown Cody where there are lots of interesting restaurants and clubs. The bathroom was 3 star but clean. Restaurant had a nice buffet breakfast. </DOC> Remember where you are when considering all the reviews for this hotel. Its Cody, WY not NYC, LA, Boston or Miami. The rooms were adequate, spacious and clean. The noise level is a bit high because there are a lot of motorcycles in the area. The stop served its purpose. </DOC> A sprawling modern complex located at one end of Cody's main street (Wendy's opposite !), it isn't really the most inspiring accommodation. Finding our room was quite tricky, involving what seemed a never-ending drive around the block. Finding one's way on foot to the front entrance was like navigating a maze ! Rooms are good motel standard, there is a small but reasonably maintained outdoor pool in the centre of the complex, the one saving grace is the hotel bar, which stayed quite busy until late. Staff were also helpful and knowledgable. The shuttle bus to the rodeo left outside the hotel in the evening. A tad overpriced, but the management do a decent job with what they're given. </DOC> This is a very large spread out facility and our room was about 4 long hallways from the front desk. There are 2 floors and there is an elevator. When we arrived late in the evening there was a long line because a flight had just arrived. I found it comforting to see that the pilots and flight attendant had chosen to stay at this hotel. Anyway, the sweet girl at the front desk was very efficient, polite and apologetic for the wait. We had a very nice room - # 172. Our bed was comfy and we slept well. We did have an issue there but the hotel staff were quick to address it and made us feel very welcome and appreciated! I recommend this hotel and would stay here again! </DOC> Our suite was excellent - spacious - clean - well appointed - comfortable. Front desk staff at C/I + C/O were professional, helpful & friendly. Location is an easy walk into town to shop, enjoy the \"Gun-Fight\" & dine. We did not dine at this property. Definitely would again stay at this property.",

Bed was comfy and everything clean and updated. I liked that the a/c was quieter than most so you can hear the t.v. Front desk nice and efficient. I would stay again if the price was right. </DOC> We stayed at this hotel a few days before the eclipse so we paid top dollar. The hotel is stunning being completely renovated. Unfortunately, our room was right next to the ice machine. At 5:30 AM the rumble began and did not ever end. I did speak with the manager because I felt there was a simple solution to making the hotel better because there were other rooms connected to the area that also must have lost sleep. A glass door enclosing the area or sound proof doors on the rooms located closest to the ice machine would truly help buffer the sound This is one of those penny wise pound foolish construction choices. The manager did refund part of our stay, but the damage was done. There was no going back to sleep. </DOC> Was in town for business and stayed 3 nights here. Check-in was fairly easy, my room was nice, two double beds. The room including the bathroom appeared clean. Was at the end of the hallway second floor, pretty quite. The internet connection was ok not overly fast but at least it worked. We did not eat at the hotel restaurant or bar. Plenty of options available within easy walking distance. Express check out! I would stay here again. </DOC> Nice welcome. Good room at the back of the building. 2 double beds in the room, which were quite narrow. Air con was very loud though. Hotel is part of a complex, but is very close to the Main Street and all the main attractions. Overall pretty good. </DOC> My wife and I stayed 2 nights while visiting the Buffalo Bill Museum. This hotel is a great place to stay in Cody. Our room was great. Comfortable bed. Pretty good breakfast buffet. Very friendly, helpful staff. About 3/4 miles to the Museum. Easy, pleasant walk. I would definitely stay here again. </DOC> My wife and I stayed here once on the road trip going east and again coming back west. Both stays were excellent. Nice, clean, quiet hotel with excellent staff. Easily within walking distance to restaurants and shopping, there were many choices. Parking was plentiful and off of the street. Although we didn't use them, the on-site restaurant and swimming pool looked inviting. I did stop in at the bar in the hotel and service was great. Staff at the front desk were very pleasant and helpful. I was very pleased with both stays and would go back again without question. </DOC> We stayed here 2 nights while traveling on Chief Joseph and Beartooth Scenic Highways. This HI had strange layout with 2 buildings that are not connected. Parking lot shares space with a cabin rental/gift shop making it difficult to find space and navigate with cars parked every which way. Tour buses had to park behind our building and at 6 AM were very noisy. No complimentary breakfast or 24/7 coffee \u2014 MAJOR miss on coffee!!! There is an on-site restaurant, which we did not try. Upon arrival we noticed trash cans at elevator (both floors) overflowing and giving off odors. Mentioned to front desk both days before they were emptied. The room was clean and double size beds comfortable. Sadly based on negatives, would not stay again.",

Nice staff-even the 2,000 waiters at breakfast were nice. My room was immaculate, clean, everything worked-even the TV for those who read my yuck Viceroy review. Elevator was quick and OMG I was able to speak in the elevator on a call-ok that's a but rude but it worked. Definitely would stay here again. </DOC> I've been to SF four times, but always in a different hotel. This time was for family vacation, so I chose this hotel based primarily on location but found that it is so much more. Every staff member we encountered was absolutely wonderful - always a kind word and politeness. We booked two adjoining rooms and they were both very clean and fantastic. The view of the city was tremendous and the location convenient to everything we wanted to do. The cable car and shopping were a short walk (5 minutes) and the self-park across the street was affordable and convenient. My wife and both teenage sons loved it and it really made our vacation that much more memorable. We're already planning a return visit and will definitely be staying here again! </DOC> We stayed five nights recently and really enjoyed our time there. Not overly in love with the lobby. It is a little sterile and not very welcoming. But the rooms are good and the Club and its staff are great. </DOC> Typical Hyatt and nothing wrong with it. We got our rooms on time though the check-in process was a bit slow. We had a very noisy room the first night and heard all the elevator movement. After we told them in the morning, we got moved during the day and they took care of everything while we were touring the city. Very good handling and customer service. Hint: order a quite room upfront The location is great for everybody who likes to discover a city on foot. You can walk everywhere from China Town, downtown, the cable car stations and even all the way to the Golden Gate bridge. </DOC> I often come and stay at Grand Hyatt in San Francisco for my business trips cause Its one of my fav place in town. The staff is super professional and kind, rooms are large, clean and the position is strategic. The breakfast is amazing with fresh fruits, pastries and the food in general is really really good. The bar is cool as well and there is also a fitness center with a stunning view on San Francisco. The wifi connection is powerful and its free. The concierge service is one of the best in town. I cant wait to be back at the Grand Hyatt. AD </DOC> fast checkin. great location. great views (we were facing Union Square). The rooms don:t have a lot of room for luggage, and the double beds are doubles, not queens, so small. The bar is nice, but pricey, as is valet parking. But you are right in San Francisco so we expected that. No in room coffee, you will have to venture downstairs for morning coffee. </DOC> PROS: -Easy 12 minute walk to Moscone Centre -Friendly staff -Easy walking distance to food/beverage options of all types and price ranges (i.e. 11 minutes to delicious budget Chisme Cantina or 10 minutes to high-end Moroccan Mourad) -comfortable King bed -bath as well as shower -our room had nice view of Union Square CONS -wish room had a rain-type shower head -room is pretty plainly decorated considering the nightly cost -centre of the city means convention shuttles can take longer to get to Moscone than walking </DOC> Stayed in room 2411 and it was noisy, was next to the room where the staff kept supplies and it was very noticeable. Room service was good, except there was not much room left when he brought the table in. Staff was friendly. I thought it was a horrible bed as it was so hard and that is personal preference but if you like a softer mattress this wasn't it. Granddaughter tried to take a pic out the window and it was filthy.

We ate breakfast each morning. Although the restaurant is not large we were always seated promptly. Very good service and a good selection of hot and cold foods to start the day. We had a couple of drinks in the bar and the service again was excellent. The location is good for Union Square, although there is large amount of redevelopment going on around this area so it is a bit of a building site. Easy access either via walking or short Uber to all the sites. From the back entrance of the hotel you can walk straight into the Apple Store. Would stay again. </DOC> It's been said before - but one of the best things about this hotel is the location - it is really central and convenient to many places. Easy walk to the BART (train/subway), close to many shops, Union Square (obviously), and not a difficult walk to either the Ferry terminal or Fisherman's Wharf and Pier 39. The hotel is good - good views and well-appointed room - very comfortable. I would stay again. </DOC> Good workout facility and small plates in the restaurant are stellar. A co-worker wanted grilled cheese and tomato soup and those were on the menu! The choose 3-4-5 is a great idea. Service was excellent. </DOC> This Grand Hyatt hotel was clearly just refurbished!

It's an efficient hotel and breakfast was good. </DOC> Stayed for three days and the location is superb.

Not for the price and the extra paid by us </DOC> We stayed at quite a few Hyatt poperties back in the 90s then went to Sofitel, Intercontinental, Westin & Marriott. We decided to stay at the Park Hyatt Dubai and Hyatt Regency London - the best stays ever - both pretty amazing! We decided to use the accrued points for a stay at the Grand Hyatt SF - no comparision to the other hotels. No soul, no personality, the room was on the 24th floor and very minimalistic and dusty. When we got the bill under the door it also included another bill for the room next door - when I brough ti to reception - no apology - gave the impression this is a common occurence! Thanks goodness it was free! We are going back to Intercontinental San Francisco - much higher class hotel in SF! </DOC> Would I stay here again? Only if I have business in downtown San Francisco. It is a nice modern hotel with all amenities. However, there are just too many tourists, i.e., chaos. Probably one of the smaller more exclusive houses might be a better place to stay around Union Square. </DOC> Perfect location for a break in the city, rooms were spotless, beds comfy and loved the coffee machine in the room . Had snacks and cocktails in the bar both were good. All the staff very friendly and helpful especially the concierge nothing is too much trouble for them helped us every day with our planned itinerary. The Bart train from the airport stops within walking distance of the hotel. </DOC> Have stayed here the last couple years for a business meeting. Everything is well done. Check-in is easy. Rooms are nice and comfortably sized. Beds are good and rooms are moderately quiet, but could hear folks having a gathering in room next to mine. Meeting rooms are spacious and nice, but in basement so unfortunately lacking any view of daylight. Food service to meetings is great. Buffet service is well done. Bar service is well done, but at big city pricing.",

Since it does not move up or down, the only way to sit at your desk - even if you are 6 foot 3 like me - is to put pillows on the chair. Even then it is unworthy. This fact alone is enough for me to switch hotels. Is it to much to ask for a $100 adjustable walmart chair when paying $350 for a room? </DOC> The location is good and the staff was great. Check-In went fast and easy. Our room was perfect size and clean. The food was good maybe a bit overpriced, but very good. The hotel itself could use some updating as the rooms are starting to show their age. </DOC> This hotel is perfectly situated for the business traveler or for vacation. It's close to BART and the cable car line. Right in Union Square for shopping. Hotel is very clean and recently updated rooms. The lobby and lounge areas are open and modern. Food and beverage at the lounge are very good. Note if you are driving and need parking,use the off site option-it's $39/night vs $60 for valet and is literally across the street! </DOC> Stayed there for two nights over July 4th weekend. I'm a diamond, so my review might be skewed in that regard. Used a suite upgrade for the two night stay and loved the room. The only complaint we had was the bed was too soft. It was a pillowtop that had seen it's better days. Don't like a soft bed at all. Otherwise the room was fantastic. Regency Club was staffed with excellent help; very friendly, too. Would most definitely recommend on our experience. Will return. </DOC> My wife and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 6 nights whilst on a recent business trip. For my wife, it was a marvellous location as it is near to all the major shops and boutiques around Union Square. For me it was quite convenient for business meetings in and around the CBD. Getting out from there to the Silicon Valley for meetings was not that difficult depending on the time of day. The hotel room on the 25th level was modern with a very comfortable double bed, has a coffee machine, and a safe deposit box. The bathroom has a shower. We did not take breakfast at the hotel as there are many restaurants, whuch opens early and close late around the area to choose from. Staff was friendly and helpful. </DOC> All OK here, room was cold though even with the heating on. Chambermaid upgraded my duvet with an internal blanket so all was good! Breakfast staff very efficient and food was great. Guys on the front door very helpful. </DOC> This is a solid hotel, befitting of the Hyatt brand. Beware there is a bunch of construction around Union square, but still it's a great location for eating, drinking, shopping and anything else you'd want to do in SF. Pros: Nice, modern hotel. Typical of Hyatt Great service from front desk and bell desk Good location, minus the construction Cons: Restaurant is too small for the size of the hotel San Francisco was dirtier, smellier, full of homeless people than ever. I love going here for 24-72 hours, but this city is going down hill </DOC> What a location on Union square.Very cooperative & efficient staff.Conceirge service is very helpful.All major stops for hopon hopoff & cable cars very close.Shopping areas,Restaurants,Pubs are in close proximity",

Beds are comfortable and overall the hotel is quiet </DOC> Very nice property in the heart of Fisherman's Wharf. The only issue I had while there is parents bring their infants into the Hot Tub. It is not good for the child's health and it is certainly not good to anyone in the Hottub. Everyone knows exactly what a child does when immersed in hot water. </DOC> We stayed here in a \"Family Room\" which had a King and a Full bed. This is a great option for families. The room was clean and looks relatively new or at least updated. We had plenty of room. The tub was a bit stained, but water pressure was good. The location is great! It's an easy walk to Fisherman's wharf, Alcatraz pier, streetcar, and Ghirardelli Square. There is a Safeway nearby for groceries. My 4 year old got sick and there is a Walgreen's walking distance and also a washing machine and dryer I believe on every floor (there was one on our floor at least). Parking is expensive, but we just waited to rent a car on the day before we left, so only had to pay one night. I would stay here again. </DOC> Enjoyed our stay here. Rooms are large, king bed and and generally quite. Air conditioning struggled but we were there during a cold spell so not a major issue. Bed comfortable and facilities at hotel include bar, pool and gym (we were under the gym and had one noisy morning as bar bells were dropped continually (avoid level 3 under the gym). Staff helpful and provided great advice on travel and stored bags until our late flight. Recommend the area over Union Square as not as squalid and easy to get around by trams, buses and cable cars (or walk) </DOC> The hotel location is great, near a cable car/near the wharf etc. The rooms are variable and can be a little tired or odd, but they are clean (aside from the contents of the fridge not being emptied from the previous guests). Service at the front desk can be slow but generally they are helpful and friendly. Food wise I would head out of the hotel to the many places close by (both better and cheaper). Facilities like the pool and parking help a lot with kids. This probably isn't a hotel I would return to but if you want to be in this area it's not a bad choice, especially for short family stays. </DOC> Spent a week here and we enjoyed our stay. As others have mentioned, if you have loud neighbors you\u2019ll be able to here them in your room but that was our only complaint. The lobby level elevator was slow and small but if went down one level there was a bank of elevators that were usually quickly available. They had a huge room with ping pong tables but we didn\u2019t use them. There is a restaurant/bar connected to the hotel and we ended up there multiple times for a beer. The restaurant always seemed busy and understaffed but the staff were usually friendly. I\u2019d stay here again if I could get a good deal, otherwise I\u2019d look for something closer to Union Square. It was convenient to a couple grocery stores, the cable car, and Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. </DOC> Before you check in send e-mail request for room on 4th of 5th floor gracing Coit Tower. Nice and quiet. Upon check in ask nicely if there are any free upgrades available. While there wasn't any, Luz comped us breakfast for our 5 day stay-- a savings of over $200. Just review your final bill as they add in Rio if you don't leave one on bill. We left tips in cash, hotel removed the charges on request. Hotel is short walk to Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39 and Pier 33 where ferry to Alcatraz is located. Only drawback is the highly touted rainshower head has no water pressure. Had to make do using ice bucket to rinse shampoo out of my hair. I highly recommend this hotel. </DOC> There is nothing inherently wrong with this hotel. It is clean and well-maintained, and the staff provides good service. Doug at check did an excellent job. The layout of the rooms, though, is reminiscent of a motel. And the color scheme and atmosphere make it seem rather cold. It seems generally uninviting. I would avoid Brick and Beam, their restaurant. Poor service and mediocre food. Actually, I would recommend against staying in the wharf area at all. It would be better to Stay near Union Square or the Embarcadero and visit the Wharf/Pier 39 for and afternoon.",

The building is very charming with red brick walls and the breakfast and pub areas share similar style. The rooms are comfortable and up to the usual very high Hyatt standard. Only complain is for the queen bed, too soft for us. Maybe needs replacing? We will definitely visit again next time! </DOC> Beautiful Hyatt in a great location to Fishermans Wharf and surrounding piers. The staff is attentive and eager to assist. The rooms and bath were fresh and clean. The beds were very comfy. Parking is valet only. The attached restaurant /bar is a bonus. Enjoy! </DOC> Paid $12.95 per day for high speed internet. 2.6Mbps at 11:37am. Pretty sad. Never got above that. Never fell to pieces either though. Obviously an older hotel mascerading as something new. Paint on the door over the copper surrounding the handle. Weird slow old elevator, etc. The usual obvious signs in the bathroom the place is old. Required $59/night valet but they don't come out to meet you at all. Work bench kinda small. Slightly uncomfortable since you're sitting so low. But workable. Room temp a little uneven but it was cold outside. Room insufficiently lit. Outside view was of the parking area outside the lobby. </DOC> Had pleasure of spending one night here for quick sightseeing stopover. The property is central, very clean, with a nice staff. Really no complaints for what it is...not a place to hang around, but to sleep, exercise if want, and head out to explore. Good value. </DOC> We stayed 1 night at the Hyatt Centric. Our room was dirty--we found large dirt marks on the shower curtain. It also sounded like 10 young men were in the room next to us. Maybe we were just unlucky but it was not for us. </DOC> This is almost a boutique hotel. Exceptionally friendly staff that obviously takes pride in their property. The concierge folks are good. They have a unique elevator system, you will understand when you stay there. </DOC> Stayed 2 nights in December 2016 for work. The hotel is walking distance to work and much better than the others in the immediate area. Rooms are basic and although I had a pool facing room there was continuous noise coming from either the plumbing or the heating which would wake you up at night. The staff service was prompt and efficient and the internet worked well. If you are looking for no frills convenience this is a good choice. </DOC> Great location if you want to be near the water and Fisherman Wharf. Quiet, clean room, and nice staff. We wish they used the Regency model with Club level and food but who\u2019s complaining. $3 bucks for coffee, $5 bucks for bottled water, $60 parking and NO resort fee. Easy walk to North Beach, a bit further to Embarcadero, Marina and GG bridge.",

Steps from the marina...gaslamp district...seaport village and the midway. The hotel itself is very nice and rooms spacious. Service was great in every level...housekeeping..front desk and restaurants. Hotel is a bit pricey but in line with Other hotels in the area. Outdoor space is nice...pool beautiful and all surrounding areas nice. Place is a bit business focused So not a great place for couples Or romance. Overall great Property in heart of downtown and only five minutes from airport. </DOC> Beautiful hotel with two towers of rooms. I was upgraded to a bay view room with a balcony so the view was amazing. I enjoyed the on site Starbucks and a place they called \u201cThe Exchange\u201d where you could grab breakfast or lunch items. Room has small fridge, no microwave. Very clean and comfortable. Cons- there is a $25.00 per night resort fee. They will apply up to $10 for Starbucks or The Exchange. The rest of the fee is for other amenities like rental bike or kayak. I was there on business so no time to do those things. Valet parking is $50/night so they offer self parking $35.00 night which is standard for downtown. </DOC> This mega marina club and hotel provides very well functioned conference rooms/grand ballrooms , sound system here are perfect. Even local and international meetings all year round, the guest areas are well secured for privacy and exclusiveness. </DOC> Thanks to the Marriott for making my birthday special From check in to check out the Marriott made me feel special I am a Platinum Elite member I got an upgrade and made to feel special My Go To Hotel in San Diego with great views of San Diego Bay and a beautiful pool area </DOC> I stay at tons of hotels and I had high expectations for this hotel. Overall, it is a nice hotel with a nice location and if you get a room with a view and balcony, its a great place. Some of the things that I did not like were the long elevator waits...it took us a good 10 minutes to get an elevator... busy night i guess... My biggest complaint was that I had an item shipped there. When I called the front desk, they said they didn't have anything for me and that the UPS center was closed. I went down the next morning and my item did arrive the day before but the clerk said they were too busy to log it and to notify me. Really? On top of that, they had the nerve to charge me a $6 handling fee.... not my idea of service. </DOC> We stayed while visiting colleges and foung the Marriott really nice. It is right on the waterfront. There is a great path along the water for a run, walk, shopping or eating. The hotel was clean and the service good. The self park was $40 per day which I thought was a bit high. </DOC> I stayed at the Marriott during the Joint Mathematics Meetings, and everything was perfect. Our room was beautiful, very comfortable, and had a glorious view (see photos). The hotel is large and has all the services you expect from a top hotel. The staff are friendly and professional. It is adjacent to the Convention Center so ideal for those attending conventions. The Marina area is a lovely place to walk. The weather and the pool were so beautiful that I made time in a crowded schedule to swim (the pool is gorgeous, much nicer than most hotel pools, large and surrounded by a garden). Many attractions, restaurants, and shopping areas are easily walkable- USS Midway Museum, Gaslamp Quarter, Seaport Village, Horton Plaza, etc. This is my first choice hotel in San Diego. </DOC> It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been here but nothing has changed. Great service and rooms are comfortable. Like the fact that they still have carpet vs the hardwood floors. Enjoyed the view of the bay and pool. Gym was spacious and staff all around was great. Hosekeeping did a really nice job cleaning up the room and bathroom and nice touches to arranging my toiletries. Bfast at the Marina bar was solid- coming back with family.",

Nearby attractions and restaurants make for a great spot for business or family. </DOC> Staying for business. The property is really nice. Excellent upkeep. Staff is friendly and professional. My room was comfortable, clean and nicely decorated. Beautiful view of the marina from my room. Comfortable home base for business or vacation travel </DOC> This was my first stay in San Diego, and couldn't have asked for a better location and better view of the harbor. The location is within a short walk from a number of restaurants, and there are a number of nice areas to take a morning or evening walk along the harbor. </DOC> This hotel is in the BEST location! It is right next to the Convention Center, within walking distance of the Gaslamp Quarter and Seaport Village, amazing restaurants, shopping, etc. and with a Trolley bus tour stop right in front! The hotel itself is huge and if you didn't want to venture out, could sit by the pool, eat in one of the restaurants or have a coffee at the Starbucks inside. My room had an amazing view of the bay, the bed was comfortable and the room itself was huge. It exceeded my expectations. </DOC> This was a huge hotel. Cute shops. Interestingly curated items to buy which is nice to see. The WiFi is tricking because you have to keep buying it for each device. It was a beautiful place to stay but a bit generic. The concierge floor is closed on weekends which we weren't expecting </DOC> Stayed 2 nights on business. Great view of the harbor from our room on 12th floor. The elevators in North tower seemed slow. The new Starbucks is nice, however, it had a line of about 20-30 people each morning. It may be a good idea to have both coffee shops open during busy times. Staff was great during our stay. The concierge lounge was clean, however the quality of food has gone down. Powdered eggs were not so good, new coffee machine took away the cappuccino option, pastries seem to frozen Costco quality. Overall I like the Marquis and would return. </DOC> This is still an average hotel with a lot of bling. The room was dusty on high surfaces (bed, pictures, etc.) and my nose was stuffed the entire stay. The lounge breakfast has gone downhill...less than basic. You'll do better at almost any other breakfast hotel. A dozen staff encounters were devoid of pleasantries. It's just highly priced, and highly average. </DOC> I am a plat norwood member who made my first stop to this hotel , using the app for online check in saying 5 words to front desk to get a key and then being able to request extra service via the app was amazing and I hope a sign of things to come.

The one downside is that there are train tracks right across the street. If you get a city view room you WILL hear trains and crossings all night. I had to have my room changed and they were very accommodating in moving my room. The staff is great and works to meet any need you may have. The pool bar has a great selection of tequila and is a fantastic place to spend an afternoon or evening around the fire pits.

Great views. very close to Gaslamp area. its a must stay. Love the beds. </DOC> A beautiful hotel with a resort like feel in the heart of San Diego. Blocks away from the Gaslamp Quarter, which is known for its nightlife. It\u2019s also right next to the San Diego Convention Center and it has a Starbucks on the property. Make sure you spend some time at the pool, it\u2019s gorgeous and it\u2019s lead right out to the Marina. It\u2019s the only place I\u2019ll stay at when I\u2019m in San Diego. I highly recommend this hotel. Special thanks to Lily, Dana, Dominic, Steve B. and Ly for going above and beyond to make sure I had a wonderful stay. I look forward to my next visit. </DOC> This is a good and very big hotel. The confierge lounge felt a little small for the size of this hotel, same goes with pool area. Staff is very service minded and friendly. The rooms are good size and comfortable, but walls are pretty thin (you can hear your neighbours). Gym was excellent food is good. And the location is awesome! however if you are arriving with car it is expensive! (should be a good discount for staying guests. </DOC> Great location right on the harbour gives this hotel the resort feel many are seeking, and while right next to the convention centre it also can serve a family while on business! Rooms are well-presented, and the Eco-option to not have daily linen changed in exchange for Marriott points is a great idea!! There are lots of other hotel options in the nearby area which must keep all others (including the Marriott) on their toes to maintain standards and services. </DOC> We stayed at the Marriott Marquis for a conference and after a particularly poor experience with another hotel while attending he same conference in 2016, I was a little nervous! Turns out I need not be, our stay at the Marriott was flawless from initial greeting as our taxi pulled up right through to the moment we checked out. Service was spot on throughout our stay. Our room was great, bigger than expected with a small couch and a desk along with a balcony overlooking the pool and marina. Although mostly too cold for swimming during our stay we dined at the pool bar and the whole area had great ambiance. Thank you, Marriott we had a great time! </DOC> Pros- close to airport, harbor and can walk around San Diego from this hotel. Very clean with a nice gym and pool area. Rooms are clean and beds are super comfy! Cons- terrible coffee in room, understaffed at front desk w long lines or short lines and long wait times, room service (do not order it) as it\u2019s from cafe and pre packaged mostly. </DOC> I'm always used to staying at a smaller more boutique hotel - but this is quite the opposite of that. It has a Starbucks in it along with a UPS and small market - so it is its own little city between the two massive towers. Parking is a little expensive at $30/night but I guess that's normal for the area. You're literally across the street from the Gaslamp District so there's plenty to do just steps away from the hotel.",

Did get breakfast several days at the casual market/restaurant downstairs. Staff were friendly. Only negative I have...towels smelled like gasoline. Probably because of their dryer-that does need to be fixed. </DOC> This hotel is almost like a resort. Dining choices everywhere - in & close to the hotel. Gas lamp district is a 10 minute walk & there are a variety of things to do there. Fitness center is \"world-class\" for a hotel. Rooms are clean, airy and comfortable. Even with all the rooms & two towers, I didn't have a long wait on elevators - something to be appreciated on this soze of property. View is excellent. </DOC> We had amazing service here! The rooms were immaculate and the staff was amazing. The amenities on property are amazing and a short walk to many restaurants and shops. Not \u2018on the beach\u2019 but great location. The only thing I\u2019d say is that they limit two people (you have to show a pass) to the concierge lounge. When you have a suite and check in with 3 people, it was hard to figure out who wasn\u2019t grabbing breakfast.... I asked twice and was only allotted two passes. </DOC> Hotel concierge is the best!

It has everything you need, including SPA, Bay views, walking distance to convention center {comicon} - gaslamp district and all that it offers). The fitness room here is really great. Parking was a bit steep, but the place is water front. If you take a pass on having your room cleaned they will give you 500 Marriott Reward points.

I\u2019ll start out and say our ONLY hiccup was check-in. We had nine rooms booked for our company and some of the rooms were somehow only booked for one night. After getting through that, we enjoyed some drinks and at the hotel bar inside while we waited for our rooms to get ready. Spacious, comfortable, and very clean is what I can say about my stay. We enjoyed the tequila bar as well as Roy\u2019s Hawaiian Fusion. This property truly has a resort feel. Only steps from the Gaslamp district as well.

The rooms are very big and clean with comfortable beds something you would expect for such a hotel. Breakfast was very good with plenty of options and decent price. Of course you could grab a coffee or snake from smaller shops as well. </DOC> We stayed in the North Tower on the 19th floor, our room had a nice balcony with a great view of the bay. The rooms are clean and spacious and the hotel is in a convenient location to other restaurants and the convention center. The hotel staff is excellent, they \"get\" customer service! The breakfast buffet is very good and the wait staff is attentive. We would definitely stay here again. </DOC> The view from the room is breathtaking. I was on a high floor and could see all the way to the ocean. The marina is just outside the hotel and provided a gorgeous morning walk. The fitness room is equal to a professional club. Multiple restaurants. Poolside bar had excellent service and food. Friday night there was a group at the pool making a lot of noise and even though on a high floor, I was woken several times until 3 am. However the following nights it was very quiet despite a full hotel, weddings and military balls. The only thing I would like changed is no concierge lounge on the weekend. I was staying for business over the weekend and would like the convenience and speed of a concierge lounge breakfast on my workdays - Satruday and Sunday. </DOC> Rooms were fine and clean, meeting rooms comfortable, Breakfast was the best meal of the day, but fun snacks and reasonable choices on buffets, Staff had good suggestions for fun activities, Close to Gaslamp District, Lots of groups using the facility but never felt crowded </DOC> The hotel was good. Rooms were clean, but you can see its aging and it doesn't match the \"Marquis\" brand. The executive lounge closes on the weekend and the staff who manages the lounge were very unfriendly. </DOC> I hadn\u2019t stayed here in the new millennium but had good memories of an early trip, then, as now, to attend a convention. I am pleased to report that this Marriott remains an excellent choice for this purpose. Meeting rooms are nearby, the hotel is conveniently located for the marinas opposite Coronado, and the restaurants in Seaport Village (which are slated to be torn down to make way for more hotels, so we were told). Our room was great with sweeping views of the bay and to the south toward Mexico. We asked for and received a no cost upgrade. Breakfast options in the hotel are few and at a fixed price. Room service consists of overpriced bags of stuff. The latter in particular detracts from the overall excellence of the hotel but appears to be become standard with Marriotts of this type. We found the staff extraordinarily pleasant and helpful.",

        "docs": "I have stayed at this beautiful Downtown San Diego Hotel many times over the past 6 years, and it has always been one of my favorites, with the breathtaking views and vibrant/resort style amenities! But, it was also a Hotel that pampered it guests with robes and slippers in the room, nice toiletries, etc., and these things now appear to be a thing of the past. The Tiki Bar and pool area were very crowded and the bartenders servers were not the best. However, the I found the same was not true with the staff/service in the restaurant in the South Tower and cafe/market in the same tower, as it was top notch with very friendly staff and welcoming vibe. The room was comfortable and adequate, but when you are charging guests a $25/day resort fee on top of the lodging rate, I think they need to do a little more. </DOC> A beautiful property in every way. First class service from check in to wine tasting to bellhops! We had a great room with an amazing view of the harbor. Hotel is very well located for easy walks to Little Italy, Gas Lamp District and all other bay side attractions. We walked every where with ease. Food was outstanding especially the buffet breakfast. Rooms are very specious and tastefully decorated for comfort. I highly recommend this hotel, our 3 night stay was absolutely perfect. </DOC> Stayed in south tower, high floor, no balcony. Paid extra for bay view. Room modest size, usual Marriott standard. Exec lounge was closed during weekend, points credit for missed breakfast. When it did open Monday, could get a bit crowded quickly as it's not very big given this is a very large hotel. Lifts fast enough, access to boardwalk made for nice walk to nearby restaurants. Late check out no problem. Pool area very busy all day and evening, families mainly, large numbers of kids as we stayed over labour day weekend. Large number of sun beds and we found some but got busy really quickly. Location right in the heart of everything, near gas lamp quarter, petco park, uss midway etc. </DOC> Stayed here recently for a convention. Was quite disappointed in the hotel, especially int he lackluster service at the front desk and in the restaurant. The front desk clerk seemed so disinterested in doing anything but the least amount of work possible, and I had to wait several minutes while the clerk was gabbing to another desk clerk about one of their coworkers. It was appalling. The line for check-in was already long, and here one clerk was pulling this. The room was only okay, and certainly the \"upgrade\" they presented was anything but. I can honestly say this hotel's management not only has low expectations, but its staff sees to it that those low expectations result in low service. Never again. </DOC> This is a very nice but big Marriott. It has a nice pool for kids and adults. They are a little unforgiving on the towels. We usually like to walk back to the room with them but could not here. Overall the pool area was clean and fun. The fitness center was very big and had everything one would need and then some. The area was nice for workout outside as well. It was a nice location to walk to everything in town. Baseball game, food, the Midway, etc.. I do not like that they close the M Club on Friday after breakfast until Sunday at dinner however. I do not like when Marriott does this. The club was very nice while there. </DOC> Jazmin checked me. She was very nice and took good care of me. The room was great on the 11th floor in the north tower with a balcony facing the train tracks where you can open both glass doors and have a breeze. Though the train came by at 11pm which was quite loud with my doors open. So I closed one door and was good after that. The room was very clean. And Maria took care of my room. She did a great job during my stay. And the hotel is within walking distance of all restaurants and the convention center. I enjoyed my brief stay. </DOC> I loved the location - it was close to great restaurants, the Midway, Seaport Village, the baseball stadium, and the convention center. The hotel staff was very helpful and professional. The hotel also had 2 restaurants and a convenient store/cafe where you could get breakfast, lunch, and dinner take away including snacks and even beer and wine. This was extremely convenient. I didn't use the fitness center but my friends were raving about it. My only real complaint was the room. I had a room on a high floor overlooking the city with a gorgeous view; however, the room just wasn't very soundproof. I heard the traffic, the sirens, the trolley bells, anyone talking on their balcony and even the person next door snoring. </DOC> This is a wonderful hotel with a customer-service attitude by everyone who works here! The marina views are outstanding, of course, but being so close to the water enables long walks with spectacular views. One main restaurant, one bar and one 24 deli meet all your food and drink needs...easy walk downtown, too.",

Ate breakfast in restaurant - it was fine. nothing to write about.... If I ever have a need for a hotel near the airport, I will stay here again. </DOC> We did have a couple of challenges on our stay at this location. The staff were very helpful in resolving those challenges. Much to our pleasure and gratefulness. That is why we stay at the Hilton Brand Hotels. Francine was especially helpful, even as a fairly new employee there. One would not know that because of how knowledgeable she was and the way she resolved part of the challenge. The location was a good one for us. We were not flying from the airport but for those who are, this would be a good choice. We had meetings in downtown Philadelphia and this location worked well for us. The location is a bit older and doesn't have all of the 'niceties' of a newer hotel. We did let the front desk know about the stopped up bathroom sink. That was a problem in our 2nd room (the 1st room we moved from for other reasons). </DOC> One night on business travel. Seemed like the check in staff were disappointed that i created work for them checking in. Rude answers to polite questions. Air con was very noisy. Breakfast was ok. All in all they should take better care of the guests. </DOC> Went to a ball game and then had family fly out so this hotel was very conveniently located. Staff was very courteous; room had all of the amenities you'd expect from a Doubletree. The restaurant was also very good, particularly the breakfast buffet! </DOC> I stayed here for one night since my flight arrived very late and I did not want to negotiate a ride to the city. This hotel has a shuttle that picked me up and I was in bed about 20 minutes after getting my luggage. The rooms are comfortable and the digital key worked wonderfully to avoid a long line of people checking in. Good option. </DOC> I was delayed by a day in getting back home. The DoubleTree happened to have a room available, and it was a great decision! The room was comfortable and clean. The staff was kind and efficient. The food was good (though service took a while). I was able to get a late checkout so I didn't have to spend as much time at the airport. I would stay here again. </DOC> Amazing location, very close to the Philadelphia airport. Very friendly, helpful and excellent staff those were very very helpful. Clean and fresh room. Not much eating option nearby. Highly recommend this hotel. </DOC> This is an airport hotel. It is not near anything. There are not places to walk. It is for sleeping to catch an early flight. As an airport hotel, it is a pretty nice one. The staff was courteous and efficient. I got there late and was thankful for the Doubletree cookie. Room was clean and comfortable. Wifi worked well even on the free tier.",

Rooms are quite average, a bit worn, but expensive for what they are. The breakfast buffet is nothing to write home to mom about, but the smoked salmon made up for the eggs that had been sitting there way past their prime. Good journey back to the airport at 5 am. ZB </DOC> I've stayed at this property many times over the years. The staff is always pleasant and helpful. Ainsley was very helpful at check-in. My room was clean and comfortable. There is no free parking, but there is plenty of it. Very close to the airport and off-site parking. The hotel does offer a shuttle.Took advantage of the Diamond-level free breakfast and as just as I remember the food was good and service staff attentive. The hotel is a bit dated and in need of a renovation, but the helpful staff makes up for the dated property. </DOC> The hotel as it is looks kind of \"old\" BUT the staff makes all the difference, they are great, i was amazed with the shuttle driver and also a colleague of his because i\u00b4m not used to have such a treatment in US generally (honestly nice) i don\u00b4t recall the names but i strongly advice if you need a stopover in PHI this hotel is what you need, clean rooms big rooms (bigger than usual) and the staff...no more words needed if this hotel could had a lift-up i would put 5 start in the review ;) thanks to you all </DOC> We stayed at this hotel enroute to home after an overseas trip. Location is convenient to airport but that is the best I can say. Carpet had multiple stains, bathroom sink had fractures in the porcelain, mold around the toilet, and I could go on. They say they are renovating but we were on the Hilton Honors floor and it was still terrible. All for $127.00 a night. Look elsewhere. </DOC> Staff is friendly and efficient, It is very convenient if you are arriving very late into PHL or departing in the early morning. Free shuttle runs every 20 minutes. The parking can be an issue when they are hosting an event. On our last visit I drove around and around. I had to finally settle for an illegal parking spot after noticing there were at least 10 other cars doing the same. One important note is we have a disabled parking placard which was useless. </DOC> I enjoyed the close proximity to the airport, the bedding is great, WiFi free and fast, the spacious rooms have coffee makers. Check in was quick and painless, so was the complimentary airport shuttle.the restaurant is overpriced for what it offers. I saw a fairly gross toilet bowl while having a bath, a result of superficial cleaning. Check out the images I took. That ginormous hair on the bathroom floor wasn't mine, either. I will give this place a miss in my next layover. </DOC> They have a free shuttle to and from the airport which came in handy. The Hilton Honors happy hour in the restaurant was excellent. As was the breakfast buffet. The room was spacious and comfortable. My room looked right out to the airport. I went to check out the pool and gym as they seemed decent. Wasn\u2019t too busy on my visit. </DOC> Stayed one night prior to flight. Hotel like others in area is close to airport and offers a free shuttle. The lobby is nice and enjoyed a nice meal in hotel. Room is growing tired. Slept well but noted many little things needed repair or update. Time to invest in remodel to property.",

        "docs": "Our family agreed that this wasn't a great hotel for our traveling style. Luckily, this was one we visited using Marriott reward points. We liked the location--close to the waterfront with many attractions and restaurants within walking distance. We were able to visit the Historic Ships of Baltimore, go into the Top of the World Observation Tower in the World Trade Center, shop at Barnes and Noble. However, we found the hotel itself a bit too pretentious. The decor is too dark--dark wood everywhere. The parking garage is ghastly expensive. We were disappointed that even though there was a fridge in the room, there was no microwave for foods we wanted to reheat. Some of the restaurants in the area only stay open until 9pm. We liked the Aveda products in the bathroom, and for a city hotel, the guest rooms are fairly large. </DOC> The lobby and elevators are so elegant, and then you ride up to your floor and are transported back to 1990. We were so disappointed by our dated, beat up room. I can't believe I chose this dog over the Marriott that is ACTUALLY ON THE HARBOR. The hallway leading to the room need a good vacuuming. When such little attention is done to this detail - how clean are the rooms? Thankfully, ours was clean. That is the only thing positive I can say. Our room was at the back of the hotel and the windows offer no noise insulation. Both my husband and myself were awoken by loud trucks booming down the road all through the night. I was certain there was a train- it was that loud - and I wear ear plugs. $33 for self parking - which actually is very convenient. </DOC> This place has been showing it\u2019s age for a while but they recently renovated the lobby and are now working on the rooms. The 12th floor is the Club level and was just reopened in the past week. The remodel is very nice with soothing colors and modern bathroom. Beds very comfortable but chairs in the room were quite stiff. Looks like they recycled some of the old furniture into the new rooms and would have been nice to see all new items in the room. I suspect most of the rooms have yet to be done and if you want a nice room then request 12th floor. Also, self parking is very easy. </DOC> Great location opposite the harbor. Large spacious rooms. To a person all the staff was supportive and friendly. Wonderful weekend breakfast buffet. I could go on and on. One suggestion as for a room close to the elevator as our was a long ways away. Look forward to staying there again. Special kudos to Marcus and Kristin (sp). </DOC> I recently had an opportunity to visit Baltimore with my family. We thoroughly enjoyed the Inner Harbor area and found this hotel to be perfectly located. Plenty of great restaurants and attractions just steps away. Check in was easy, staff was friendly and the breakfast buffet was superb. Don't hesitate to chose this hotel when visiting Baltimore's Inner Harbor district. We're already planning a return trip to see the Orioles play next summer. </DOC> First time to this property during a recent trip to Baltimore. Found the hotel clean, nice rooms, Very Good staff and easy to get to. Connected to the mall for those that want some shopping as well and easy access to the local area and other food choices. </DOC> Stayed for one night on business, perfect for a business trip. Room was clean, comfortable, good location, friendly staff. The club room had a nice selection at different times of day, and everyone was extremely polite and seemed to enjoy working there. True or not, it makes one want to return. Front desk staff especially friendly. </DOC> Stayed here on business, and found it to be well placed in the city, modern, and well staffed. It is a short walk from the train station, and within easy walking distance of many restaurants on the inner harbor. The doorman was a fount of knowledge about where to eat and what to do. It's pricy, but very nice.",

The restaurant has a sparse but adequate menu. The bar is inviting. The fitness room is notably spacious and very well equipped. The hospitality suite is typical of Marriott style and menu. This is a comfortable place to stay for business. </DOC> This property is gorgeous. We came here right before Christmas. It is located right at the harbor. From our room, we see the harbor through the window. We can see the Ferris Wheel, the stores and the people skating in the outdoor rink. It's just beautiful. The property itself is attached to the harborplace shopping mall and has an entrance to it. The underground parking space also has an elevator leading to the hotel lobby level. In the winter, this is especially convenient. On the fifth floor where the restaurant is, you can see underneath and check out the whole shopping mall. I am glad that we chose this place to stay (parking is around $35) and will definitely return in the future. </DOC> I love being able to walk across the street to Inner Harbor, that proximity simply cannot be beat. In addition, the staff is very friendly and helpful and the hotel well appointed. We have stayed here on several occasions and have enjoyed it always. </DOC> I stayed here recently on a business trip and had a great stay Lobby was very nice Check in was fantastic Lobby bar and concierge both very nice Great location for downtown and/or tourist things I had a very reasonable rate which was nice Only negative - it\u2019s 2018 we have phones, have outlets next to beds. My room did not have an outlet bedside </DOC> I just returned from a two night business stay at the Renaissance Baltimore. The best thing going for the hotel is its harbor front location. Situated on the scenic harbor it is in close walking distance to many good restaurants, bars and shopping. It is also a short walk to the aquarium. The rooms are average, with the furnishings showing signs of wear, the bed and bedding was just ok. I stayed on the eighth floor. Half of the eighth and most of the ninth floors have room remodeling being done. Plastic drop sheets are up and plaster dust and debris is visible in the halls and on the carpet. Sounds of grinding and hammering start early, so I was happy that this was a business and not a leisure trip. </DOC> We stayed here when we visited Baltimore last week. Our room afforded a nice view of the Inner Harbor. However, there were a few people making noise outside our room about 1 AM. That said, after my wife called the front desk, they promptly sent someone up to tell them to be quiet as it was late in the evening. We also heard clicking from the ice machine during the night. The breakfast was very nice and the staff was accommodating. We definitely would stay here again. The parking was $30 per night with in/out privileges. $10 more for valet parking. </DOC> This hotels best assets are it\u2019s inner harbor location and the friendliness of the employees. It is a nice hotel, but has nothing special to differentiate itself from other nearby hotels. Rates are a little on the high side. You are paying for the location and convenience. It\u2019s on par with the Hyatt Regency across the street. I would stay again if rates were better than similar inner harbor hotels. Be aware: Parking is extremely expensive, so be sure you are prepared for $30-$45 per night parking charges. Better yet, use Spot Hero to find a slightly better rate by parking in a nearby garage. </DOC> This hotel is not a new one but one that is clean and comfortable. Had to change room due to street noise on the back side.. but the staff accommodated my request. Best rooms are the ones facing the courtyard.",

Food pricey but typical and 3 decent options and a Starbucks on site. It's a big hotel, maybe a bit impersonal but I prefer that. I'd definitely re-book. </DOC> The hotel is beautiful with a grand big lobby, lots of restaurants, and atrium elevators. The swimming pool is on the 5th floor deck, it\u2019s pretty large, surrounded by plenty of lounge chairs and palm trees. The water temperature is warm enough. The rooms are ok, some have a nice city view. The valet parking is $40. There is a parking lot next door which charges $25 for 24 hour parking. It\u2019s a little far from the French quarter, especially from Jackson Square, it\u2019s over 20 minutes walk. Otherwise, it\u2019s a good place to stay. </DOC> It was a shame that we could only stay the one night at the Hyatt Regency New Orleans on this visit. My status as a Discoverist member was acknowledged and I appreciated the room upgrade after long hours of travelling. Every single staff member provided exceptional service. The breakfast had a great range of items including an egg chef. Service was a bit hit and miss at the breakfast restaurant but it did not detract from what was a great visit. We visit NOLA twice per year and this is now our hotel of choice. Thank you staff and management. </DOC> Location is good if you need to be near the superdome. I would personally like a French Quarter location more. This is a huge hotel and the facilities are nice with restaurants and bars - just the huge hotel experience though. People are nice and service is pretty good - housekeeping could up their game. </DOC> This is a very large property and has many convention facilities. Check in was quick and easy. Automated check out was even easier. Numerous restaurants and bars are on-site. Rooms are very well equipped and lack nothing. Bedding was very good.

The type of room we booked was not available upon arrival (there were many, many conference groups staying at the time) and staff were quick and friendly with a solution. Plenty of food and walkable neighborhoods nearby. Hotel has an adjoining parking garage. </DOC> Rooms were very spacious and clean but the bathrooms were extremely small and different to move around in them. to get to the rooms you need to take an elevator or escalatars first then walk thru the resturant area to get to the elevators that go to the rooms.

There is a large restaurant and bar area on the first floor accessed by escalators and a pool area plus bar on the 7th floor. The room was slightly small but comfortable and a good size bathroom with complimentary toiletries. The reception staff were very helpful providing maps and info about the city. </DOC> Perfect location for a Saints game. The Dome is right around the corner. The hotel has many conveniences like Starbucks, and the elevator ride has a glassed view. They need to lower the price of their buffet if they want us to eat there - it was overpriced for what they offer. </DOC> I had a perfectly fine stay at the Hyatt Regency New Orleans, which is a massive hotel in a good, central location. Not too far from Bourbon Street but far enough away that you didn't feel like you were right in the thick of it all the time. If you're looking for a more refined less party type of location, this is terrific. It's a short walk to all the action. My room was just fine - nothing amazing but absolutely fine. The key system for the elevators is different, but it's not as confusing as people make it out to be. Having so many restaurants on property might be of interest to some, but with so many great dining options in New Orleans it was a tough choice. </DOC> this is a large hotel located beside superdome. My room view was muddy construction site. Staff were very friendly and helpful. You need directions to find your way around this facility! Hotel was busy so their odd elevator system was over-worked with long waits. Hotel restaurant was fantastic for lunch - shrimp Poboy. Lobby personnel were fantastic especially bellhops </DOC> I will say that the staff that ran the convention, set up, served food, etc.. was nothing short of outstanding. Meal after Meal the food was first class, very New Orleans and well done. All of the workers where on their game and always available to clear tables, guide you, greet you. I was very impressed with the quality of the service provided at this place. </DOC> Was here for a convention. This is purely a big convention hotel. It's a hike to the French Quarter. Rooms are three star. Nothing wrong with it, but no reason to stay here if it's not where your meetings are being held. Service was fine, except that my room was cleaned at different times each day, making it hard to predict. You really need to take a taxi to anywhere you want to go. </DOC> Not the most central location but as there is a steet car stop outside the hotel it's ok for transport to central New Orleans. This high tech hotel is beautiful. The lift needs your key to operate them and knows which floor you need. The rooms are spacious two beds, refrigerator and safe. The bathrooms are ridiculously small. The public areas and bars are very modern and like the rest of the hotel well appointed. The price in the bar is very expensive.",

Fantastic hotel, look forward to my next stay there. </DOC> The breakfast buffet was great. Plenty of quality options and priced at about 27 bucks. The issue was slow service for coffee and omelette delivery. The upgrade to the corner king was a waste of money. Room was not any bigger than a standard room. Not especially comfortable. Elevator operation is finicky. </DOC> I was impressed by the size of this hotel. It is beautiful, huge, and sometimes you get a bit turned around. But the hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. They are always staff around to help out. There are quite a lot of dining options as well. It was easy to find something good to eat if I was unable to go out into the city. My room was spacious and comfortable. Both the bedroom and the bathroom were clean. Despite the size of the hotel and the large number of people staying, my room and the hallway outside it were surprisingly quiet. The conference I attended was also in the hotel. The meeting spaces were great, and there was easy access to the FedEx store. </DOC> Recently spent a week here on business and my satisfaction increases with each stay!! Front desk staff - especially Arielle - is fantastic and super accommodating. I was mistakenly placed in a handicap accessible room and reassigned without any fuss. Only knocks on the rooms are the small bathrooms and limited storage space. Everything else, just fine. There's a nice grocery store just 2-3 blocks away (sort of like Market Street) with tons of natural/healthy options for the fridge in the room. I'm just impressed with the level of attentiveness, professionalism, and service from EVERYONE since I first stayed weeks after he grand reopening. It remains my preferred choice whenever in Nawlins!! </DOC> I would highly recommend this hotel if going to something at the Superdome or Smoothie Center. It is very close. Our check-in service was very slow, but the staff was very polite and friendly. I loved all the dining options inside of the hotel (although we chose to walk to restaurants nearby, except for breakfast.) The layout of this hotel is very confusing and it would be horrible to find an exit in an emergency. I didn't think it was worth the price for a suite, but would recommend for a standard room. </DOC> The hotel and room layout is a bit confusing, because it is really a stack of meeting rooms separated by disparate steps, elevators, and escalators. The hotel rooms are nice, though seem to be getting a little dated and worn. The meeting rooms are adequate, and their conference food quality was generally pretty good. Pretty good location; far enough from the noisy French Quarter, but easy to get there by trolley at the door or by foot. Quite a few restaurants tucked away nearby, and the concierge is able to offer competent suggestions. Parking wasn't great, either. </DOC> If you have business in downtown New Orleans this is a great place to stay away from the crowds. The rooms are nice, the restaurants inside it are decent and well priced, the staff is friendly and it\u2019s close enough for a 20 minute walk to Bourbon Street. The WiFi worked well and reached most every spot inside the hotel. My only issue was housekeeping this time around was horrible. I\u2019ll start again should I have business in the hotel and hopefully they will teach housekeeping how to do their job. </DOC> This is one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in and while it is big I loved the design. A really modern hotel that does a great job of paying attention to details. Like everything in New Orleans it is close enough to many of the major attractions to walk or everything is a short taxi ride away.",

Breakfast (in lounge) is better then it was 2 years ago. Plenty of fresh fruit, bread selection, oats,... </DOC> 5 nights, 2 people, 2 Q. Easy check in, able to split the bill between 2 people up front, so check out was super simple. Clean, comfortable, quiet. I usually stay here once a year for work and feel very welcomed. The restaurant and lounge are nice to have on hand for evening meals/drinks. Didn't use the pool this year, but it's super fun to be up in the clouds in the water, take kids for sure. I always find staff to be accommodating and friendly. </DOC> I usually stay at the Westin or W when in Seattle and decided to try the Sheraton for a change. Overall the Sheraton is a solid representation of what we expect when staying at an SPG property. The service experience from the moment we arrived was prompt and friendly. I have only one complaint, and that is that a property of this level really needs to have better lighting/magnifying bathroom mirrors for shaving/make up application. </DOC> Had a corner room on the 18th floor and never heard any noise from other rooms or housekeeping in the morning. Heard some sounds from the street traffic, but not much. Sleep quality was very good as a result, which was helped by a comfy bed and squishy pillows. The bathroom counter space was good and the mirror had a cool lighting option for low glow at night. Really liked how each side of the bed had accessible outlets/USB plugs for easily charging your electronics on the nightside table. 24 hour gym has plenty of cardio and weight equipment, and with a good high view from being on floor 35. Wifi worked with no problem in the gym and room. Mostly walked places since the hotel is centrally located. But when we needed an uber or lyft, we never had to wait more than 5-8 minutes for one to arrive. </DOC> I had gotten a very good deal to stay here on Hotwire so wasnt sure what to expect but I was really pleasantly surprised. Very friendly staff with efficient and friendly checkin. Was given a beautiful and spacious room on 18 with a great city view. Hotel is in great location from which to see Seattle. I agree that the Wifi policy is out-dated and needs review but its available for free in the lobby for now. Parking is expensive at the hotel but available for about half the price in any of the self-parking lots around it. Overall, I highly recommend this as a place to stay in Seattle </DOC> this one covers all the basic needs of someone doing business in downtown Seattle. Really next to the Convention Center. The executive floor was extermely convenient. However, restaurants at the hotel, left much to be desired </DOC> We started a Globus tour here, and had added two extra nights on our own. The hotel was at a perfect location with a free shuttle stop out front, and an easy walk to several other locations. The tour included breakfast, and the buffet was good, but the optional omelets made it even better. They opened a Starbucks (this is Seattle) in the lobby while we were there. It might not be a budget hotel, but it was quite comfortable, and the price seemed reasonable due to the location. </DOC> My wife and I used this hotel to visit my son during Amazon Bring Your Parents to Work Day. The building is a bit old, but the room was clean and spacious. It is also conveniently located in the city center.",

Right in the heart of Seattle city centre and easy walk to most things, including tram to Space Needle, Pike Market, waterfront. Bed was extremely comfortable with great bedding. Excellent bathroom, large and modern. Wifi was free as we were SPG members, worked well and fast, a nice change. The hotel has several restaurants and bars, with an afternoon happy hour. It was expensive but you do get what you pay for! Some examples of Chihuly glass in the foyer if you don't get a chance to visit the museum. </DOC> I always enjoy this restaurant mainly for seafood. The service is very good. It is located close to the Seattle athletic club and the public market, as well as the first Starbucks in the world. A bit pricey </DOC> SPG/Marriott 75+ Platinum. Sheraton has been in a weird identity crisis for a while now, but I was really impressed with this property. Rooms and lobby had been updated and the staff was really great and you're in a central location. Would have loved to give it the final star, but the walls can be thin and we had to call downstairs bc some parents thought it was a good idea to let their kids scream and slam doors up and down the hallway starting at 7AM. This went on for two hours before it stopped - not the hotel's fault, but would have liked to see them address it faster. Regardless of the rude guests we'll be back. </DOC> This hotel is in the heart of downtown near the convention center. It's a large, grand hotel with two towers of hotel rooms. My husband is a Marriott platinum member, so we were upgraded to a relatively spacious room. The concierge lounge had tasty breakfast and evening appetizer and desserts every day, which was nice. Even in the off hours, we could access the lounge for drinks and a nice place to sit. There is valet parking, but you can also do self park around the corner, which is cheaper and still affiliated with the hotel. The gym had a great view of the city, but it can be busy at times. All in all, a great stay. </DOC> The hotel is very impressive as soon as you walk through the door. The staff were very helpful, and checkin was quick and easy. Our rooms were spotless, a very good size, and catered for everything. Wi-fi was very good, and the TV was extremely BIG!. There is also a Starbucks in the lobby for all you coffee lovers. The hotel was in a great location, and is very easy to navigate yourself to and from. Fantastic stay - well done Sheraton </DOC> Sheraton Seattle is one of the best we have stayed among the many hotels we have visited. The room is clean, spacious. Check in was a breeze. Free WiFi. The location is perfect, just a short walk to the Pikes Place Market and a block from the light rail. Sheraton is part of SPG group. Unfortunately, the benefits of a SPG gold member are less attractive than a gold member of Hilton group. </DOC> Two of the best things about this hotel is its location and proximity to all things walkable in downtown Seattle. You don't have the higher prices of the lodgings on the Sound but only have a quick step to great restaurants and of course, the Market. The rooms are clean, quiet and comfortable and the hotel restaurants are typical and a bit pricey, they are good and reliable. The staff is well-appointed, knowledgeable and kind. In fairness to my typical Hilton leanings...I'm a new fan of Sheraton and Starwood... </DOC> Great location, right in the middle of some excellent eateries and only minutes away from Pike St. Markets, the monorail and big shopping areas. Staff were friendly and efficient. Breakfast buffet ok for a big hotel. Bonus is the free waterfront shuttle stops at the hotel making the trip back from that area a breeze. Room was spacious and well appointed. Only issue was it was pretty stuffy, even with air con running",

        "docs": "I often stay here, and although the front desk seems to change weekly, I was happy with reception and departure. The rooms are upgraded, and the club lounge has been expanded and is very nice. They now need to stand at the door and keep people out who are not supposed to access the lounge. I was situation on the club floor, and watched plenty of people coming and going.. I would think that not unlike NYC there should be a reception desk, asking for room numbers. The towels.. must be the last thing that needs to be upgraded. They are old and thin. Please make these better. </DOC> I stayed at the hotel for several nights recently fur business. The room was clean, comfortable and appeared to be newly renovated. It had lots of plugs for electronics which most travelers need. The staff was helpful and there were lots of good restaurants nearby. I would stay there again. </DOC> I love the Sheraton. I have hosted several programs at the Sheraton but hadn't been back since 2016. I love the renovation that the hotel completed. The lobby looks amazing. I loved my guest room - spacious and yet cozy. The attention to detail of the staff makes every visit memorable. It feels like coming home each time I return. I look forward to coming back to my home away from home. </DOC> The Sheraton hotel is perfectly located for both business and leisure travelers. Just a couple minutes walk from Pikes place, major shopping areas and many great restaurants I thought this was the perfect place to stay. My room was spacious, modern and clean with good amenities. I also had a good view of downtown. The lounge had a good selection of drinks and foods for breakfast and afternoon hour. All the staff were great and were friendly and helpful. </DOC> I stayed here on business and was put into a King bed room in a very nicely styled room. The bed is very comfortable. The bathroom was very nice though it would have been nice to have a bath option as well. I used the fitness center and was impressed with both the size and number of machines available. In addition the pool looked very nice and was very large. </DOC> Very large hotel geared toward business and convention travel. Was able to book connecting rooms for a family. Rooms were pretty typical for a Sheraton, but slightly above average finishes and bathrooms. Our room was in the Union Tower, though club lounge and gym/pool are in the Pike Tower. Pool is indoor, relatively small. The gym is on two levels and good sized to match the property. Location is great, short walk to public transit, Pike Place Market, etc. </DOC> This is about a block from the Westlake metro station. You can see it as you exit the station and it is not too far of a walk, even with suitcases. Check in was quick and i enjoyed my 20th floor room. The view was great so I can only imagine what it would be on a higher level. They do have a Starbucks coffee bar which is great for breakfast and there are other restaurants a short distance away. I did like the fact of the free bus shuttle which collected and dropped off directly outside. This took me to the Space Needle, International District, Pikes Place Market and the ferry, so great to get around if you are not that mobile. Drivers accept tips! I don't really have much else to say. I was impressed with all the staff and this would be my go to place for a hotel in Seattle. </DOC> Stayed for two nights in August, during the heart of tourist season. The lobby was very bustling and the rooms were spacious and well appointed. Best part of the hotel was definitely its location close to Pike Market, shopping and restaurants. I would definitely consider staying again when I plan my next Seattle city break.",

By walking about 1 1/2 blocks, you get to the Light Rail station which is great for getting from and to SeaTac Airport. The ride is about 45 minutes and the cost is $3 each way ($1 for seniors.) The hotel rooms are very good. Clean, up to date. Good connectivity with multiple outlets near the desk. WiFi speed was good, but as with all hotels, as a security professional, I recommend that you run a VPN Virtual Private Network `to secure your access. </DOC> The hotel was a perfect location. The rooms were clean and up to date. The check in staff was very friendly. I got a peek at what life will look like in a few months when your mobile app will allow you to check in and your phone will be issued a key. Hopefully staff won't be eliminated to much. The lines became long at the front desk~ humans still have a need to connect and problems will come up. </DOC> I made a reservation for a Sheraton and immediately sent in a lower price. On its webpage Sheraton promises a Best Price Guarantee. It turns out that even if you send a screenshot of a lower price and the url, if BPG can't find it hours or even days later when they work the case, they will not honor the BPG. BE WARE!!!!! </DOC> The Sheraton Seattle downtown was very nice. I am a hotel snob and was very comfortable there. Nice room on the special Starwood floor for frequent travelers. The staff was very nice and friendly. I was there for business and liked having bars & restaurants in the hotel. Across the street from the convention center & a block from Nordstroms. </DOC> This is a typical full-service Sheraton with all expected amenities. The rooms were of nice size, not too cramped with stuff. Club floor upgrade for my SPG Platinum. Club lounge was nice atmosphere, offerings just ok. All staff encountered were pleasant and helpful. Good value for price paid. I'd stay here again. </DOC> There is a great deal to like about this hotel. It's a typical Sheraton, so midrange amenities and accommodations. But the bar, concierge lounge, restaurant, rooms, and service quality are all excellent. The staff is friendly and helpful. Best of all, it's only a block to the Westlake transit stop, that offers Link light rail service to the airport, a bus stop, and the monorail. It's also one block from the Pacific Place shopping center, which also has excellent restaurants. Pike Place Market is just a few blocks away. Views of Puget Sound are available on the hotels west side, but even views to the south and north have something to offer. Only views to the east are of little more than the urban landscape. This hotel has become my new go-to in downtown for all of these reasons. It's definitely a favorite. </DOC> I played tourist and took 2 days in Seattle for the Garden Show, some theater, shopping and sightseeing. I was thrilled to learn my Room was ready early so I could start my adventures quickly. Valet parking was easy and fast. My room on the top of the tower was clean and well appointed. I particularly enjoyed the reading lights embedded in the bed headboard. Curiously the sound from the flatscreen TV did not sync with the individuals speech pattern which made for odd TV watching. The atmosphere was quiet and restorative. I loved the bathroom lighted mirror but I still found it challenging to apply makeup with the existing lighting. Maybe it\u2019s just me. All in all the room was excellent and the central location to city activities can\u2019t be beat. Give it a go! </DOC> We've stayed here before and it didn't seem like it was anything special. But this time the friendly staff seemed to go out of their way for us. We had a corner suite that was absolutely gorgeous--wish that we could have stayed a second night! Comfortable bed, quiet floor, and nice amenities. The gingerbread display is open 24 hours a day, so there was time the next morning to see it without the crowds.",

        "docs": "Stayed here for a connection at the Atlanta airport. What a beautiful, clean, amazing hotel. Easy to get to and from the airport via the free train....no Uber\u2019s, slow hotel shuttles or cabs. Restaurant on site and a great little Champions sports bar across the street at the Marriott. Would definitely recommend this hotel to all traveling through ATL. </DOC> We stayed one night at this hotel, on our arrival into the US. The information we received in advance told us to simply take the Skytrain to the hotel. This doesn\u2019t cater for international arrivals - you have to first take a shuttle bus from stop 3 to the domestic terminal, then take the Skytrain. Still, that\u2019s my only small criticism. Everything else was just right - large room with an incredibly comfortable bed, large bathroom with great shower, and lovely, friendly staff at reception, at the bar and in the executive lounge. We had dinner sitting at the bar - quinoa salad for me and pulled chicken sandwich for my husband. Both were very good. Breakfast in the lounge was better than most hotel lounges we\u2019ve been in, with plenty of choice. We would definitely use this hotel again when travelling through Atlanta airport. </DOC> Usually a hotel can get by on a great location but the Gateway adds a great staff, smart looking lobby and bar. Stayed here as we had a 5:50AM flight the next morning and was able to leave the hotel at 4:40am for the 3 minute train ride to the terminal. Probably should have left 15 minutes earlier as the airport was more crowded at that hour than I expected. We ordered dinner for the room which we picked up at the front desk and it was tasty and saved us the room service charge. The Marriott Lounge was attractive and had a great selection of drinks and some nice hot appetizer type items. It would be hard to find a better airport hotel anywhere in the USA. </DOC> This hotel opened May 2017. Very, very nice and trendy. I have never stayed in a hotels this well decorated. It was a pleasant change from most hotel d\u00e9cor. Nicely located near the airport, this was the perfect location for our stay in the area. We received a nice upgrade to a suite and it was just great. I highly recommend this property and will definitely be back. </DOC> This is an excellent hotel located in ATL Hartsfield Complex. It is easily reached via a 2-minute Sky Train ride. It is very open and airy and stylishly decorated. My sleeping room was large and comfortable with a terrific glassed-in shower. I had free Executive Club access that provided a good breakfast buffet including delicious grits. There was a nice Lobby Bar and restaurant which I did not visit. Will definitely make this my \"go-to\" hotel in Atlanta. </DOC> A brand new and stylish hotel located just one stop away from the airport using the monorail. This is definitely a huge plus if you are planning to have a stay near the airport since it is really convenient. Service was great, bed was comfortable and room was relatively spacious. This will be my preferred property should I need to stay near Atlanta airport! </DOC> Had to stay in Atlanta as Delta cancelled our flight home without securing a hotel for us. We chose to stay at the Renaissance. We ate at the hotel as we were exhausted from the stress of the trip. Food was good, service was excellent. The hotel was clean, quiet and all around what we needed, with a shuttle to the airport every 20 min. so you can choose what time to leave. Good experience. </DOC> My husband and I stayed here in between our domestic flight and international flight the next morning. It was very convenient with the monorail system from terminal that runs continuously bs waiting for vans/shuttles that are over stuffed. The room was clean and comfortable\u2014 I didn\u2019t love the modern decor but that\u2019s simply a matter of taste. The bed, room and bathroom was comfortable and clean. The restaurant was good and fast for dinner. I\u2019d stay here again when passing through.",

        "docs": "My husband and I recently stayed at the Renaissance Atlanta Gateway hotel twice, as we used it as a base to travel to Savannah for a quick two-day trip. We were pleasantly surprised at the high level of customer service exhibited by all of the staff. As an example, we were having difficulty with their hotel printer, and the hotel manager ushered into the club lounge to ensure we were taken care of. The bar and restaurant personnel were very friendly, which made me forget I was staying at an airport hotel. Well done: On my next trip to ATL, this is my hotel! </DOC> It\u2019s so nice to return my rental car, hop on the Skytrain, stay at one of the Gateway hotels and then enjoy the hassle free 5 minute trip to the airport for a morning flight home. I\u2019ve now been in all three of the Marriott properties at Gateway and the Renaissance is the nicest. Very friendly staff all around. The Concierge Lounge is on the small side and tucked behind the lobby bar. The evening offerings were fantastic though. A spicy dish and then a beef brisket! Desert comes out later and was full size portions. The lounge staff was excellent and helpful. I enjoyed the design touches. The shower was awesome. Everything was super clean. The only down side for me personally was the hard (wood?) floors in the room since I prefer a carpet in the bedroom. </DOC> We stayed here at the beginning and at the end of our two week holiday to the US. Here are the main points; Good Great location Great friendly staff Spotlessly clean Great beds and pillows DJ at night in public area Good restaurant Negatives ?? Only thing we could fault was the loud music played outside at all times, even when the DJ was playing totally different good music inside?? Sitting outside you do not want that loud awful music spoiling the lovely sitting area!! </DOC> It is a brand new hotel So all rooms are nice, up to date and comfortable. Hotel offers very limited services: very small lounge with very limited offer and no swimming pool. There is not a real restaurant. Ideally located for transiting by plane </DOC> Had tasty here due to flight issues. This property is very easy to get to from baggage claim. Just hop on the tram that goes to this hotel and car rental. Very convenient. Once you get off the tram, take the elevator down you are a very short walk to the property.The property is very upscale and the rooms comfortable and spacious. The staff did a wonderful job as well. I got upgraded to a suite which was nice. more room than I needed but loved it nonetheless. The bathroom was huge, the shower very large and it had a large living room and a dining table as well. My bed was very comfortable. They also have a nice restaurant on property which was excellent. They also have a decent size concierge lounge. I will definitely stay here again! </DOC> Hotel is clean, modern and very comfortable. Access to the airport and car rental lot is terrific. Despite the close proximity to the airport, the room is very quiet. Only negative is for the business traveler ... the desk is poorly situated and does not have a proper desk chair. Restaurant has great food but the beer selection is poor. </DOC> Hotel is beatiful; upgraded room was great. Front desk staff at checkout were a complete band of ill-trained fools. After giving them 30 minutes to figure out how to check me out--I simply changed credit cards for payment--i volunteered to do it for them. They declined. I then left to go get my rental car at the rental car center and told them i would be back in 30 minutes and hopefully by then they would have finalized things. Got back 60 minutes later--supposedly finalized---but still had an error. Took phone calls later in the day with Amex to challenge the charge. FIVE PEOPLE hovered around one monitor.....you would have thought it was a moon landing they were looking at. General Manager was nice and apologetic---he has a tremendous amount of work to do with this gaggle of fools. </DOC> We have stayed here 3 times since Thanksgiving for flights from ATL, the hotel is extremely convenient if you are flying Domestic as you can take the Plane Train that runs between the Domestic terminals and Car Rental. Staff at the front desk have always been friendly and courteous, and the restaurant very good. Our least favorite would be the breakfast in the hotel which could use more options and service tends to be a little slow. Also can't get a Bloody Mary before 11 O'clock???",

        "docs": "I had a great stay at this hotel. Because I'm an SPG Platinum member, I was upgraded to a suite - two levels (bedroom and bathroom on a top floor, kind of like a loft); two bathrooms, wet bar, dining area, and large living room with a large balcony - very clean and comfortable. I'd definitely stay here again. </DOC> If not for the tiny bathroom this would get a perfect rating. Comfy bed, fun room with the famous amazing views inside the circular Westin high rise. Quiet rooms, frigid hallways, fast elevators. The bathroom was so small you have to walk in sideways and step over the toilet to reach the shower. </DOC> This is an expensive hotel so I am certainly judging it more harshly than a mid level. However, newly renovated Hamptons or Holiday Inn Expresses are better appointed. First, the room needs more outlets. We travel with so many electronics. If I was here with my family we would not have enough. Second, was the lobby designed by MC Esher? When I first arrived it was not intuitive at all. Other than those negatives, this was a decent business hotel. </DOC> I have stayed here two times and each time has always been a great experience. There are no rooms with a bad view of the city. In the heart of all the action. The staff has always been helpful and nice. We were there last for our anniversary which I happened to mention in a conversation with the desk clerk and she told us to wait and went to get a nice gift box of cookies/chocolate. The restaurant is the Sundial and the food was great. Very pricey, but good quality food. I highly recommend this hotel. </DOC> Overall, this westin was great to stay at. Convenient to the marta, convenient to many attractions, just a tight entry way to the bathroom. Beds are a little firm, but getting soft. Chose to participate n the green program, but was not credited with starpoints. Platinum ammenity included a breakast buffet in the cafe, Friendly waitresses. Concierge very helpful to assist with any request, short wait at the front desk. </DOC> If you are looking for a hotel in downtown Atlanta, you should absolutely take a look at the Westin Peachetree. Located a block and a half from the Peachtree MARTA stop (a a 20-25 minute ride from the airport) its in a great location. The rooms are typical Westin, which is a good thing but the thing that sets them apart is the views you get across the Olympic Park for miles beyond. Oh and their room service is fast, efficient and good as well. I would absolutely stay there again if I were in Atlanta. </DOC> If you are seeking an upscale environment conveniently located to all things Atlanta with superb attention to detail, look no further. The staff is professional, courteous and attends to every detail. The food is excellent The meeting rooms are well equipped From checking to checkout you can be confident you chose well. </DOC> We had our choice of a standard room on the 69th floor or a suite on the 45th floor. We chose the suite. The view was great! Can't imagine what one from the 69th floor would look like. The bed was very comfortable and a very modern bathroom. We had a mini-fridge, which was nice. Only negative is that we had to circle the hotel 3 times before we could find a way to get into the parking garage. The Westin is within walking distance to many places to eat and lots of nightlife.",

I have not run into anyone who has been unfriendly. I am glad there is a new shuttle van but please get real getting into the back rows takes being an acrobat and is not great for shuttling tons of people to different locations. I am looking forward to renovations as the hotel is in desperate need as several room doors have issues. </DOC> I had a room on the 42nd floor, with spectacular views. The room was very clean and I had two big beds all to myself. The bathroom could have been a bit bigger but don\u2019t care too much for the size of bathrooms. All the amenities needed including safe, iron/board, fridge, big massive tv. The hotel has a nice Starbucks and a decent size indoor pool and gym. The area is very central and close to many places to eat and entertainment. </DOC> This was our highest hotel room ever, on the 63rd floor ! Very clean, super nice, facing south with a view of the CNN building, the Georgia Dome, and the new baseball stadium. Great location within walking distance to everything downtown including the Georgia Aquarium. Also had dinner on the 73rd floor revolving \"Sundial\" restaurant which was equally nice with an ever changing view. There may be nicer, newer hotels downtown but none have these views ! Still the place to stay downtown as far as I'm concerned. </DOC> Stayed at the Westin Peachtree while attending an event at the GWCC. The GWCC was a very quick and easy walk from the hotel. The location is also convenient with many restaurants near by. One thing, likely specific to my room, was that the AC unit was really loud. So loud that it drowned out the TV and I was adjusting the volume as it turned on and off. I was only there for one night so it was not a big deal, but it was pretty loud. That said, I recommend this Westin when staying in downtown Atlanta. </DOC> Stayed here for 4 days for a convention. Hotel is friendly & convenient to all. Walking distance to GWCC, CNN, arena, dome etc. Beautiful place to stay. Recommend ... view from 48th floor room at night </DOC> I was here recently for a conference and upon arrival I let the gentleman know it was my first time at the property and to give me the best you got! Well, 65 floors later, bam, it was a room with a view and it was awesome. At one point, I was literally in the clouds. Love Starbucks being part of the property as well. Seemed convenient and close to everything I needed. </DOC> This excellent experience started with one of the warmest welcomes I've received at a hotel in a while, and an unexpected upgrade. The floor-to-ceiling windows of the higher 60 floors offer a pleasant view. Rooms are quiet, clean, and well equipped for the business traveler. The only (minor) issue was that the shower water temperature was hard to set (either too hot or too cold). Great experience, will stay here again. </DOC> My wife and I spent a long weekend at the Westin to just get away. We had a suite on the 66th floor with a great view of the city. The room was very spacious but had a couple minor annoyances. 1. There was a strange hum that repeated often. Maintenance look mystified as it appeared to come from the elevators. No one inquired any further. 2. Light out over the bar area. We were slightly disappointed in the lack of restaurants in the hotel. Breakfast at the sundial restaurant was standard hotel buffet food. There were very limited options for dinner. A bright spot was the concierge who help us find shopping and restaurants outside the city.",

I thought the room was really nice and I did the green program and got a $5 off coupon which I used at starbuck's. A lot of my conference was held in the conference rooms at this hotel, so that worked out well. The hotel is near lots of things to do in Atlanta. I found the front desk staff to be very helpful. </DOC> I got a room on the 44th floor, and wow the views were spectacular. The room overlooks Olympic park and the Atlanta eye, quite a view from here. The room is clean, nicely appointed. The bathroom is small, not proportional to the bedroom. Location is great for downtown Atlanta, everything is just a few minutes walk. There is the Peachtree marta stop to get around or from the airport. Restaurants everywhere to satisfy many tastes. Nice hotel but a bit too large to be excellent and bathrooms should have been designed better. </DOC> I stayed here on a stopover with work. Room was a good size and the view was of the Ferris wheel and across towards the Olympic park. The room was clean and the bathroom also a good size. Staff were pleasant to deal with however breakfast in the restaurant was not a good experience. Dirty coffee cup had to replaced twice before my server found a clean one. Floor and wall by my table were marked with food. A brief stay but comfortable. Just perhaps find somewhere else for breakfast. </DOC> I had a one night stay at the Westin for a corporate event and was very happy with my experience. The staff at check in was efficient and friendly. The bed was comfortable and the shower was one of the best I\u2019ve ever had. The entire property was clean, which seems to be the biggest challenge for many of the hotels I\u2019ve stayed at lately. The hotel\u2019s location is excellent for everything in Downtown Atlanta. The catering staff was excellent as well, real Southern hospitality. </DOC> I was here for a Thursday and Friday night stay and slept like a rock. For a urban hotel it is the quietest I have stayed in. Just a couple of blocks from Centennial Park and a couple more to the Mercedes Benz Stadium. The front desk help was very friendly and promptly addressed my questions. The Starbucks in the lobby was very convenient. The meeting room was comfortable and the catered luncheon was very tasty. There was security around the lobby, which may have just been because of the Soccer championship, but I felt very safe. Also it is just a block to the MARTA so super convenient to and from the airport. </DOC> Love the Westin. The staff is always great. When i checked in i realized i forgot all my toiletries and the staff brought me up everything i need for like a month. It was a nice gesture. The room is great. Amazing views of the city and park. Would def come back. </DOC> This has to be one of the larger hotels in the country. I believe it is 72 floors. The lobby was a bit hard to find you way around but once we got to our room we were pleased. The rooms are not large but they are very nice and clean. Shower had a nice rain head on it and the bathroom was very clean as well. We visited the restaurant bar on the top floor. Cool views of downtown Atlanta. The food was pretty good but it was a little expensive for what you got. We got a good deal on Hotwire for this hotel and it was definitely worth it. Good downtown location near all the action.",

        "docs": "We stayed here for x2 nights at the end of a recent road tour. The hotel location is excellent and can be reached by MARTA from the airport to the Peachtree station. Our room was on the 27th floor so we had a restricted view of the city, but was clean and comfortable.Great location for access to the Falcons amazing stadium , plusalso the College hall of fame and Coca- Cola world.check out is at 1200 but as we had a later flight we're able to hang on until 1400 which helped significantly.' </DOC> Wonderfully situated hotel in downtown Atlanta within one block of a MARTA station. Quick $2.50 trip on the subway from the airport. Reasonably priced (room rate was $133/night for my stay). Beautiful view from the high floors. Bathroom was comfortable if somewhat small. Room was very comfortable, with quiet and effective heating system, and comfortable bedding. Elevators are fast and without much of a wait. Food service is reasonable, and staffing good. </DOC> This was our second time at this hotel, and we will be back for 3plus! We were on the 47th floor. The rooms are amazing with floor to ceiling windows and incredible views. Comfortable king size bed with lots of pillows! The rooms were very quiet. We walked by a neighboring room as we went to the elevator, and you could clearly hear a party group, but we heard none of it through the walls. We were not able to use valet as They were full, but there was a garage across the street. The hotel is within walking distance to restaurants and clubs. </DOC> This venue should also be listed in \"things to do\". You don't have to eat at the Sun Dial Restaurant to enjoy the view. For a very small fee you can go to the top and see the amazing views that Atlanta has to offer. The viewing platform is right above the restaurant and is worth a visit. </DOC> This a huge hotel. Room was nice. Although it was noisy. As an international hotel I missed the \u201cEuropean\u201d electrical plugs or usb plugs. Breakfast was ok. Checkout could be done more efficiently. All desks were occupied by staff but checkout took some time. </DOC> It has been about 10+ years since I have been here. Did not let me down then or this time. Great location. Great front desk staff. Internet was great. Food too. Did not make it too the SunDial but you should. My bedroom was on floor 70. At that height no noise from the outside world. But high enough that the clouds where outside the windows in the morning. Really wanted to stay longer. Will stay again. Tip: If you arrive and the Valet line is taking longer then you think is reasonable it might be because they are full. Immediately abort, drive down the street and make a left at the yield sign (1/2 block). Then another left. That will bring you back to the self parking garage attached to the hotel. </DOC> My wife and I stayed here for the Shaky Knees music festival weekend. Location was perfect and check-in was a breeze. The room left a little to be desired. Given the shape of the hotel - round - the bathrooms were very small with a small doorway to enter. Not much you can do about that though. However, the bed did not live up to heavenly bed status with uncomfortable pillows and bedding. Lastly, the maid service was terrible during our visit - they did not make the bed or even replenish the used towels they took. Overall, the property was not up to Westin standards. I will add that mange net contacted us after our stay regarding the maid service and noted they are working to address the issue with their staff. </DOC> OK - truly there are other places you can stay in Downtown Atlanta.....but, when you want to stay at a landmark - with views that are just incredible......there is nowhere else to consider. Gold member - upgraded to 64th floor - and just a beautiful view. Room has been updated - and bed was extremely comfortable. Staff was very forward leaning - and accommodating - and there is plenty to do - nearby (and plenty of places to eat). Property is huge and there are numerous on-site eateries and bars. You will not be disappointed staying here.",

        "docs": "Stayed 3 nights with family and thoroughly enjoyed the resort! Pools were great and paying the extra money gave us access to the club facilities - unbelievable breakfasts, afternoon teas and canapes too. Only problem is we couldn't stop eating! So hard to resist the wonderful food on offer. Managed to play a bit of golf, pool and swam lots. The resort is really big, but the walks around were spectacular. Beautiful gardens - certainly one of the highlights. Would love to come back again. </DOC> Last Sunday of the month was promoted as unlimited champagne buffet. We found that this was very misleading because we had cheap Spanish sparkling wine with a brownish colour. The price of the brunch was RM300 ++ and we thought fair for champagne but not for cheap sparkling wine and cheap red wine. If they used their imagination and offered Methode Champagne it wouldn't be so bad. The four of us vowed not to return. </DOC> We stayed at this resort after our initial hotel in Batu Ferringhi was sub par. This was lovely and amazing and the staff couldn't have made things better. Our last night in Batu Ferringhi was spent here and one night felt like a whole weekend. Everything was perfect and lovely. Couldn't fault it I tried. Thank you Pooja for an easy check in and for making us so comfortable. This hotel would make us come back to Batu Ferringhi alone. </DOC> I have travelled for many years and I have never experienced this level of service from any hotel I have stayed in. We stayed in the Rasa wing and was totally spoilt. The friendliness and service of the staff is second to none. The grounds and pool areas are just superb and once again the upkeep is exceptional . The food is of exceptional quality and variety , the service is just first class. If you want a complete rest then look no further, the Spa is just amazing. This is without exception the best hotel I have ever stayed in </DOC> The beach setting is near perfect, as well as the pool areas. The rooms are still the best in Malaysia. But I also enjoy the High Tea at 3pm, and the cocktail hour at 5pm at no additional charge. The service is excellent everywhere on the premises. My only complaint was a view of the parking lot instead of the gardens and ocean. </DOC> We stayed in the wing that had the access to the lounge. We had a choice of room and the bell boy guided me well in selection of the room. The room was decently large with a small lawn outside which had access to the area leading to the beach. Pool in the Rasa Wing was only accessible for +12 age. We had to use the other common pool. Spice Market Cafe was good food with great staff. Sunday lunch time was fun time with a clown making balloons for the kids and keeping them entertained. Pinang Restaurant and bar was also great place to have drinks and some food. Overall, good experience. </DOC> The Rasa Sayang is definitely one of the best and largest hotels on Penang, and the service and facilities were as expected for this type and style of hotel. It can be rather large and impersonal, particularly during low season, however the Executive Wing upgrade is worth it for the lovely afternoon tea (at no charge) and the evening cocktails and nibbles. Rooms are well equipped and the buffet breakfast is excellent. Prices are as to be expected, but there are plenty of food court options just down the road. </DOC> We stayed at 2 hotels in Penang, Rasa Sayang and the sister-hotel which Golden Sands. They\u2019re just next to each other. Buffet spread is amazing, rooms were big and clean. The downside for us is that getting through room service or any service was very problematic and slow. Secondly, as the pool area is underneath the trees, the pool is almost certain to be covered by leaves which leaves the pool to appear rather \u201cunclean\u201d. Please be advised that there are some refurbishments works happening near the pool/beach.",

        "docs": "On this my fifth visit to Penang, I decided to stay at the Rasa Sayang Resort and I have been delighted with my choice. This would need to be the top choice of a place to stay on this island. My daughter and I stayed in the club wing of the resort and were spoiled with excellent service and beautiful food. We enjoyed our lovely room on the top floor with a view of the pool and ocean. We also enjoyed our hot tub on the balcony. The grounds of the hotel are kept in beautiful condition and it felt like an oasis after a day out and about. We cannot recommend this resort highly enough and would like to give Jonathon (Jon) at the front desk an accolade for amazing kindness and great, very helpful service! </DOC> This was a great experience in the Rasa Wing, to have such the special touches of pre dinner drinks and canapes ,and a level of service that is outstanding. The grounds are glorious with so much room to enjoy the trees and sea with seating readily available. The breakfast is a complete experience with plenty of seating options and very quick service. The staff are very friendly and engaging. </DOC> Everything in this hotel is at its very best! Check in was very efficient and receptionist provided very helpful information about resort. Room was fantastic: big comfortable bed, elegant room decoration and large bathroom with luxury amenities. Breakfast buffet is amazing. We stayed 5 days in hotel so we were able to taste all different dishes at the buffet. Pool and surrounding gardens are beautiful and very peaceful. All employees of the hotel are always smiling. Their #1 priority is to make our stay perfect. </DOC> Our room and bathroom was huge and well stocked. The staff of the resort greeted everyone with a smile that started in their eyes and you felt that they were genuinely happy to be of service to you. Personally, I felt that the food choices for westerners was limited (ie no bacon at breakfast and no roast meats at night) and we therefore preferred to get away from the hotel for dinners. </DOC> We last stayed more then a decade ago before the major renovation. This time we stayed at the Garden Wing which used to be the more expensive side. Don't think this wing was refurbished as the room and bathroom were dated but comfortable nonetheless with a view of the pool. Any relaxation by the pool was difficult as it was noisy with children. Overall it was a comfortable weekend stay - a good spread for breakfast and a decent gym. The resort is quite big so it would have been helpful if the front office could have provided a map and a quick brief of the facilities and activities during check-in. </DOC> We stayed in the Rasa Wing and really appreciated the calm child free environment. Especially the adult only pool which was a tranquil haven compared to the main pool. The staff were genuinely friendly and keen to make you enjoy your holiday. We had a hiccup due to the the loud behaviour of guests next door, no fault of the hotel at all, and Nick the resident manager pulled out all the stops to not only move us but give us a fantastic upgrade. Customer Service at its very best. The Spa and Salon both offered exceptional treatments and were great value. Food in every restaurant was very good, especially the Ferringi Bar and Grill. Cannot fault anything, would go back. </DOC> Although we didn't stay here, we toured the facility and were very impressed. Beautifully manicured grounds with lovely pool. Pleasant and welcoming staff. Lovely sculptured pieces displayed throughout the hotel. </DOC> Stayed for six nights in a garden view room on the third floor, I would book on the highest floor possible as you will get better views. Spice market breakfasts were excellent, as were the evening buffets. Used the Pinang beach bar, which had a happy hour at 5.30pm. Very well equipped gym with excellent life fitness equipment. Pool is adequate, but could have been bigger. The staff were very welcoming helpful and well trained. Nothing much in Batu Ferringhi to do or see. Excellent bus service outside the hotel which will take you into Georgetown. The hotel also offers a shuttle service into Georgetown",

        "docs": "I should not tell you this as the cat will get out of the bag, but here goes. This is one of the best places we have ever stayed. It is not that the motel is that spectacular, though it is clean, nice and modern, it's that the location is beyond-belief beautiful. The staff is efficient and nice and unobtrusive. The place is small, with only about fifteen suites, so, unlike Queenstown, there are no crowds (hordes?) around your home. The view out the back window is, no-doubt, the best you will ever have in a natural setting. Go hiking and see vistas that rival any in the world, then come back to your snug-as a bug beautiful room. Then marvel at the stars at night. Best recommendation: bring your own food, as the local choices are not that great. </DOC> This little gem is a perfect base for exploring the area. Reasonably priced, attentive owners who are happy to let you know where to go and what to do and when to do it and spacious rooms make for a perfect set up. Rooms are generously sized as is the bathroom, complete with kitchenette. If you're short on some basic foods (noodles, soup etc) the owners have a small number of products available for purchase from their office which is extremely handy. The property has everything you need for a visit to the area. When I'm back in the region again, I'll have no hesitation in staying here once more. </DOC> The hotel is pretty modern and has a great view of the mountains. services very friendly however there is no dining facilities on site and we had to go next door or go to the upper village to get something to eat (they do sell instant noodles) Wi-Fi is not very reliable and the bed is a little bit too soft. overall a good stay. </DOC> The interior of the rooms is well planned and spacious, with good facilities for self catering. The exterior has been less well planned, with car parking blocking some of the mountain views and rather soulless grounds. Landscaping has not been given priority or as well managed as other similar sites in the village. </DOC> Clean warm unit with some cooking facilities (no oven). Fantastic views to the mountains and a 1 minute walk to lodge (backpackers) next door which serves pub food. No undercover parking. Friendly hosts. We would definitely recommend staying here to wake up right in the heart of Mt Cook and glacier country. The Mt Cook airport is just 5 minutes away if you want to spoil yourself with a helicopter flight over the Tasman glacier. </DOC> Very large room and bed. Good sized bathroom, with spa bath, and kitchenette. Hob in the room and s good selection of kitchen utensils. Can\u2019t cook fish. Good view of the mountains. WiFi slow but worked. Short walk to village centre. </DOC> We stayed at Aoraki Court Motel for two nights from 9-10 March 2019. The units are very comfortable, clean and tidy. We really enjoyed our time here and it was very close to restaurants, cafes etc. May we suggest that perhaps a small table & two chairs would be great outside to view the mountain and soak up the atmosphere. However, I know that in winter time perhaps this is not an option. However, everything else was perfect. Thanks. </DOC> We stayed two nights in a corner room with my elderly Mum The view from the room was superb and of course we booked good weather The room was very comfortable and clean with good windows that showed off the views The heating was excellent and in each of the bedrooms which was very welcome Spa bath comfortably fits two people Staff were friendly and helpful We would definitely stay again",

There was also a guest laundry which came in handy. </DOC> Managed to visit this area on a beautifully sunny day. The drive up the pure azure/turquoise lake with Mount Cook in the distance was beautiful. Rather than the very popular Hooker Valley walk (which can be very busy) we diverted up to the blue pools & Tasman glacier road for 3 shorter trails that gave very different perspectives of the Tasman glacier and with far less people - all with Mount Cook towering over you all the time. Thanks to the D.O.C for all the great paths they have made. </DOC> Honestly, with the incredible view of Mount Cook dominating this little village, we would have happily stayed in a tent. However, this place just adds to the wonderful experience of being at the base of the mountain. Spotlessly clean, spacious (our room had a double and single bed), and with a kitchen that included everything you might need, this was a great place to stay. It's a little on the pricey side but, as with anything that costs more...if the result is a good experience, then the price...within reason...doesn't really matter that much. Reception were helpful and friendly. Would highly recommend. </DOC> Don't look beyond this hotel for a stay in Aoraki/Mt Cook Village. We only stayed here for one night but could happily have stayed for longer. The rooms look recently refurbished and are large and comfortable. The heating works well which is important in winter and the TV and free WiFi were great. Parking is plentiful. It is located in Aoraki/Mt Cook Village which is more like a collection of a few hotels and places to stay for staff. Eating options are limited so either bring food with you and use the kitchenette or head for the overpriced, rather average restaurants. The village itself is worth a visit with great views and some nice walks. I would definitely recommend staying here over the other options available. </DOC> We were warmly greeted on arrival and quickly booked in and shown to our chalet. The chalet was very well equipped and very comfortable .The views of the mountains from our patio doors were amazing.It is a view you have to see to be leave. The chalet was also very large and airy and also clean and tidy. You also get complimentary wireless access throughout. Views alone are worth the visit. </DOC> We spent two nights here in early Jan and had a pleasant stay. We had a beautiful view of the mountain from our room which we loved! The staff were friendly and informative. The village itself it tiny so if you\u2019re staying for a while I would recommend shopping before arriving as it takes 45 minutes to get to the shops. We paid extra for the spa room but we\u2019re disappointed as the spa didn\u2019t really seem to work. The jets turned on but weren\u2019t really powerful, in our opinion it wasn\u2019t worth the extra money. </DOC> We visited during the winter month and were impressed by the cleanliness and comfort of the cabins. Magnificent mount view! Great quality bathroom amenities. You can prepurchase the breakfast which has a small milk and cereal. It would be best to bring you own food as the rooms have stove and Kitchenette. When we visited, no shops nearby when the Hermitage was closed for renovation. This is a great place to be the base of all your mt cook activities. 10mins to mt cook airport. If the sky is clear of clouds, best place in the world for stargazing. </DOC> Aoraki Court, like its sister motel Aspen Court in Franz Josef, is modern, clean, well maintained and efficiently run. Maybe lacking in character, it performs its job well: safe, clean, modern facilities. We had a spa bath in the bathroom:very pleasant. I think there were good views from the sliding glass doors but the weather was so bad our main view was cloud and rain. I won't be returning because I was unimpressed with Mount Cook And a quick point about the wi-fi. Very slow, constantly dropping out, but we were right up a mountain valley",

The rooms and bathrooms were large and newly decorated, perfectly clean with parking outside the door. We stayed for one night in January and it was quite expensive. </DOC> Stayed here overnight recently. Location is on the bottom of the village which is about 5 minute drive to DOC. Room is heated when I checked in which is much appreciated at this time of the year. There is a beautiful view of Mount Cook from my room. Room looks newly refurbished and is spacious. Heating is good. Shower pressure is also good. Wifi is good. There is free parking in front of your room. Overall, I have enjoyed my stay and it was a shame I was only there overnight. </DOC> $255 is definitely pricey for a simple room, considering we could rent a house in lake Tekapo for $200 per night. We stayed here for 1 night. The room itself is very spacious and clean. The bed & pillows were comfortable. The place actually looks quite new. The staff here are very efficient. The minute we checked out, they were already in our room cleaning. Talk about efficiency... You get 200Mbs of free wifi per person which is really good. </DOC> Perfectly appointed rooms. Very clean, quiet, nothing to complain about. Friendly staff. Book early and get one of the units with an un-interrupted view of the mountain. For food the hotel is great with spectacular views but the mountain cafe is better value. If doing the Hooker Valley walk (must do for sure) go early to avoid the buses. Leave the room by 0700 or 0800 at the latest; 15 mins drive, </DOC> Stayed here for 3 nights. Room was very good and the owners were friendly, constructive and helpful. They gave very sound advice regarding places to dine for lunch and dinner. They were very knowledgeable regarding the various tours and helihikes available from the various guiding companies nearby. Cleaning was superb and totally non-intrusive. We would unhesitatingly go there again! Quiet part of toen but minutes of walking to all restaurants and Guiding companies! </DOC> Location is excellent, with great views. Soundproof. The rooms are very cozy, very clean and pleasant. The kitchenette is well equipped. Very good bed and linen. It's kind of expensive, but I guess they may have surcharges to pay to operate in the national park </DOC> We did come to Mt Cook in the school holidays so prices were inflated but this was the most expensive hotel we stayed in during our 2 weeks in NZ (NZD$295/night). While it was modern and comfortable, with a nice bed, underfloor heating in the bathroom, water heater in bedroom, it's just a place to lay your head at the end of the day, and the price we paid just wasn't value for money. I would have booked a cheaper option, had it been available. </DOC> Although the weather was not the best,our room was a fabulous place to watch the clouds hoping for a glimpse of the tops of the mountains,which indeed we got later in the evening. The heated bathroom floor was a joy! We had brought our own food so didn't venture out to eat but even in this tiny location there were several options. No complaints about this place at all!",
