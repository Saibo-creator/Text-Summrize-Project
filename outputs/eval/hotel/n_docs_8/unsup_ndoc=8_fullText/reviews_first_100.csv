0,"We had a one night stay at the Roxbro House with a deal bought via Groupon. We thought we may not get as good a service due to the price paid, however although our room (3) was a little small for two adults and a dog, it was perfectly formed with lots of lovely touches. The whole house is beautifully furnished to a high standard and the host was very helpful and welcoming. I would thoroughly recommend this lovely B & B - we will be back! </DOC> We stayed in Room 2 which was lovely - good decor and clean. There is a guest lounge downstairs with an honesty bar and some lovely treats, brownies and millionaire shortbread when we were there. There are some nice touches in the rooms too - apples, shortbread and chocs as well as dressing gowns and slippers. There is a good breakfast choice with everything freshly cooked. Warkworth itself is a lovely little village (definetly take a look at The Greenhouse, a great little shop!) and the B&B looks right onto the castle ruins. </DOC> We went for a few nights on the recommendation of a friend and had a lovely time. A warm friendly welcome, lovely room with a view of the castle, large bathroom and yummy biscuits and chocolates. For Happy Hour ( complimentary on the sideboard and not to be confused with the honesty bar ) the wine was good quality and the cheese delicious. Breakfast was awesome with nothing too much trouble, even getting some beans which were not on the menu. When I got back home I read the reviews which I had not done before visiting and can only say the two bad reviews must have been from 'professional moaners' - I can say mine is an honest review and my review profile is worldwide !! Well done Claire and Stu on a 5star B & B we hope to return </DOC> We have returned from 3 nights in this fab B&B. We had the room overlooking the castle and it was wonderful. We enjoyed the Cheese and Wine hour (complimentary) and my husband loved having a piece of cake when we returned from our adventures! We managed breakfast only on one occasion as we were so cosy in our massive bed! Breakfast was cooked fresh and the choice was impressive. Parking was fine - you park right outside! We shall return and try a different room! </DOC> Booked last minute for a Saturday night stay and very glad we did. Lovely warm welcome, great position opposite Warkworth Castle and easy access to the village. Nice old house that is spotless and loved. One of the best breakfasts we've had in B&B's and fancy hotels! Think Roxbro House will be seeing us again . </DOC> I can only agree with previous reviews on this site. Lovely B & B. Warm friendly welcome from Claire and her husband. Excellent breakfast. The honesty bar is a nice touch. I would recommend the walk from Craster to the Ship Inn at Low Newton. </DOC> Roxbury house is an excellent place to stay. We had a suite which was very comfortable. The bedroom was large and bright and the large separate bathroom had an attractive bath in the centre of the room and a separate shower. The choice for breakfast was very good. I felt that it was a bit over priced but I would still go back if I was in the area. </DOC> I booked this as a surprise for my partners birthday and I am so glad I did - I couldn't have made a more perfect choice. Every little detail is included to make sure you have a fabulous stay. I booked the Ethel Nobel Suite and it was just luxury. Lovely big comfy bed, fabulous view of the medieval castle, huge slipper bath and all the other little details that the room included from candles to chocolates. The owners couldn't do enough for us but were not intrusive in any way. The breakfast was to die for - I could happily eat the Roxbro Rosti every day and served with a smile and friendly conversation. I honestly could not find anything bad to say about this place and it is a little pricy but worth every penny!"
1,"The location is at the top of the hill in Warkworth. It has parking outside the front door,as this is adjacent to the main street care is needed to reverse out safely. the room exceeded our expectations.There was a good breakfast each morning. The only down side is that we had to hang about in a cafe before we got in at about 4pm </DOC> The first thing that strikes you when you arrive is the castle across the road - what a stunning location in a quaint and beautful village. We had the room at the top of the house which had two bedrooms and a huge bathroom. Note that the stairs are many and while we were fine, it may be an issue for some and also for large bags. The bedroom is beautifully furnished and the bathroom has a fantastic shower. There is a lounge area for guests but there were 2 couples in there one afternoon so there was no space for us. There is a large garden to sit in which is lovely. It is a short walk to a number of pubs and restaurants and the village is the type that you just want to walk around, lovely streets, buildings, old bridge over river, gardens etc. Breakfast is good and cooked to order. </DOC> A good welcome by the proprietors who were available if needed. More of a small Hotel than a B&B really which is a nice thing. Room was comfortable clean and linen fresh. Excellent view of the Castle and good breakfast. An added benefit is the reception rooms provided to guests to relax and unwind. Warkworth is a great base for Alnwick, Lindisfarne, coastal route etc </DOC> Drive up from Amble along the river, up the hill past the impressive Warkworth Castle and stop. Youare at Roxbro House. Aperiod buiding with parking outside front door. Awelcoming landlady, very clean and decorated house. Big warm room overlooking castle. Big comfy bed, filter comfy, slippers and dressing gowns. Downstairs several lounges, DVD'S and an honesty bar, un believable! Individually cooked breakfst, allow plenty of time. The Roxbro Rosti is to die for, potato cake with melted cheese,bacon and a poached egg. Best breakfast ever. Bit pricey for a guest house but on balance, worth it. </DOC> This was our first visit to the area and we were pleasantly surprised. The Roxbro is ideally positioned to visit the many areas of local interest. It is very well run and the cheese and wine hour at 17:00 is a very welcome opportunity to meet and chat with the other guests. Our room was large and had excellent facilities, unfortunately due to the heat the fresh milk, which was a nice touch, had curdled by the morning and we had to ask for fresh. Warkworth is a very pleasant village but there are only limited places to eat in the evening so we had to drive out to the surrounding areas. We certainly plan to return to the area and would have no hesitation in staying at The Roxbro again. </DOC> This is quite sad to admit but having watched channel 4's tv program ""three in a bed"" where this B&B won the contest we desired to pay a visit. The welcome was second to none as was the premises and our room (room 1). Clair the owner showed us to our room and explained that between 5-6pm there was complementary whine and cheese in the residents lounge (both wine and cheese were nice). This I thought was above and beyond what you would expect normally even for a 5* gold rated. The room was very tastefully decorated and with an equally tasteful on suit shower room Chocolates, biscuits tea and coffee readily available in your room. Parking is private and directly outside the B&B. Within 5mins walk and adjacent to the castle and two pubs a stones throw away. Breakfast was plentiful and of excellent quality We'll definitely return </DOC> Two nights at this superior B&B- great location in Warkworth, itself a place worth staying a few days or even more with good pubs, a wonderful castle and much more. Roxboro House will be our premier chopice for a short break in future. Great room, beuatifully prepared and lovely bathroom (super towels) and in room Amazon Echo was a bonus. Breakfast is fantastic and the welcome to our Border Terrier was genuine and an added pleasure. Parking is easy- just outside. All perfect! </DOC> Stayed for one night in this stylish and comfortable hotel. Lots of add ons available to provide those extra treats but we found room 1 had all we needed for a special short break - including a great view of Warkworth Castle. Breakfast was very pleasant in the conservatory and service with a smile from Claire! The Roxbro is very well located to explore the beautiful Northumberland coastline. Follow the 'Coastal Route' signs and you can't go wrong especially if you love castles and beaches. Only small quibble is not being able to check in until 4:00 and check out at 11:00. Minimum time spent in such a lovely room but great weather meant we were able to be out and about anyway. Recommend The Hermitage for evening meal. Live entertainment on Fridays - thank you 'Natalie'."
2,"This was a great hotel. The room and bathroom were very modern, the hotel was easy to get to, it's only minutes from Luxembourg City and I slept very well. There is a restaurant and bar on site, but you are out of the way which is what I wanted. There are restaurants nearby, but you do need a car. I recommend this hotel. </DOC> I've stayed here twice now, mostly because it is conveniently close to the airport. It's located in an industrial/commerce park, so there are no restaurants or bars nearby. But, it has a nice bar area which was lively on my last stay, the rooms are quiet and large and well designed, the breakfast is expensive (20€) but excellent variety and quality, and it is just off of the A1 motorway so easy to get to. So the bottom line is, if you are arriving late into Lux airport, it's a great choice for business travelers. However the free parking out front is quite limited so you will likely either park underground for a fee or on the street for free. </DOC> About a 15 minute car ride out of the city but a beautiful, modern hotel. Staff could not have been nicer and the service was great. Beds are comfortable, rooms are well appointed and quiet. Would highly recommend this hotel. </DOC> Dear oh dear. Scrambled eggs cold, breakfast rolls hard, INDIFFERENT breakfast staff as before that I complained about in 2014. They were playing their game of shifting people of large tables once they had sat down. If the table is reserved put a reserved notice on it, dont game with guests. Staff talking infront of guests not keeping their chatter behind closed doors. There definitely a long standing issue on how the breakfast staff relate to guests never mind the poor quality of the food. So yes, no pictures !. </DOC> Hello, I spent two nights in Luxembourg for business and booked ""Légère"". I came by car and my GPS was leading me to another street (same name) in Luxembourg town. So beware and put ""Munsbach"" for sure... :) Anyway, the hotel is really great; good service, good rooms and bathroom, excellent breakfast. If you don't have a car it could be a problem. I really recommend this place! Cheers, Sara </DOC> This is a really great hotel. It looks fantastic and offers everything I would expect from a stylish, London getaway... except it's in Luxembourg... which makes this hotel a rare treat. For business this hotel was just right. We spent two days based in the conference room behind reception and enjoyed the outdoor space for meetings and a BBQ. Breakfast outside on the terrace was also very pleasant. The food was very impressive. The service was fantastic. I had a bath tub in my bedroom which I loved and everything was designed very nicely. This really is ""hard to find"" in Lux. The airport is less than 10 minutes away by taxi and a bus to Auchan leaves the hotel complex regularly. </DOC> This hotel is close to the airport and 20 bus minutes away from the center of Luxembourg city. Very good facilities in room, and restaurant serves complete buffet of breakfast, open bar and good fitness facilities including sauna and Turkish steam bath. Dinner menu is well chosen and even the biggest eater will have a feast dining in this restaurant. Room did have some stained carpet but ok, things can happen ;-) During week probably many business visitors with financial background. </DOC> I stayed for two nights at this very good hotel. It is very modern but a true 4*. The location is very good. A short 7minutes drive to Luxembourg City is great, but I heard the highway a little bit in my room. Very good is the patio for the restaurant/bar. The breakfast was good, but expensive if this is not included in the room rate. It was a very good stay in a ver good hotel."
3,"Located on a business park ,the hotel is close to the airport ( 10mins ) and about 30 mins from downtown Luxembourg Reception is welcoming and the rooms are very good- well laid out Restaurant serves very appetising dishes reasonably priced </DOC> Stayed for a conference. Hotel is light, bright and airy. Very clean and modern. Lunch in the restaurant was fantastic, very healthy. Location is very near to the airport but a good drive to the city centre. Rooms were very modern- I maybe would not want to share with someone I didn't know too well as the shower is completely on display to the bedroom. The conference was arranged brilliantly, the staff were very helpful, gala dinner menu was very nice and the meeting rooms were lovely and bright. </DOC> Good prices if you book via a booking company. Evening meals can be expensive and rack up costs. After a falling out with them a few years back on staff attitudes we have stopped eating in. I note the objectionable member of staff still works there after I clipped her card so as to speak. We did get upgraded on our next visit but you do remember these things. The hotel over the years has made changes to it's decor which is interesting to see how they fit this in the original concept. Breakfast / dinning area has been redone from our last visit which has actually reduced the buffet area and choice. The food is still good but reduced range. Off all the hotels close to the airport this one is still the best if you are driving and using the hotels in this location rather than staying in town proper. </DOC> Wonderful hotel very modern with a good restaurant and attentive staff. But hidden away on a business park like some Ibis not what I'd expected good value in an expensive city and definate worth a visit </DOC> Stopped over night on my road trip, was surprise by how beautiful hotel it was. Room is fitted with designer furniture, bottle of sparkling wine as welcome drink, very comfortable bed, no complaint! Hotel is located outskirt of Luxembourg city, good for business where lots of office is walking distance, but if you are up for night out, this hotel is too far... It has nice gym, sauna. Minus point is restaurant close so early, so we ended up eating nuts and crackers at bar all evening. </DOC> We took the opportunity to stay at this hotel after a party in town. The location outside the city (in a business area and close to airport ) makes it not so convenient for pure city visitors but great for business in that neighbourhood, . The hotel is very modern, quiet and very clean. It has a overall lounge style and deco. A bit trendy fashion ( there was a photo model event that evening) .Parking is easy and free. The lounge bar is nice as well as the restaurant. Breakfast is ok as well. Service is pro and efficient. . There is a fitness center and a wellness center but we did not have the time to enjoy. The room is also very nicely designed , flat screen, open bathroom, large bed, white deco,..... Last but not least, we had a special rate for the night making it real value for money, </DOC> The hotel is in a business park so is most probably busy during the week. The rate we got was ok and the room was nice. We feel the parking on the weekend should have been less expensive. Alternatively, we should have parked outside. Rooms were nice but a little warm and we had problems with the fan/airco/heating. We also had an issue with noise in the inner courtyard after dark but that was resolved fairly quickly. The night we were there, the restaurant was only available to those paying for the Jazz Night which was a little inconvenient. We did have a light dinner in the bar but the service was pretty slow. A nice hotel but I think we could find a better deal elsewhere. </DOC> OK its in the middle of nowhere (close to the airport) on an office estate but it is good. Nice large comfortable rooms, with dito beds and a super breakfast. Free quick wifi. Not much parking available but there is a parking garage (15 Euro / night). The only drawback is that our room (#148) did not have a real shower but rather a steep step into a bathtub. They probably have other rooms with normal showers as well. It is a busy hotel but the staff are courteous and professional. Recommended especially during weekends when the prices are correct."
4,"Good location by car. A rich and exceptionally varied breakfast - Really gorgeous Superior Room with large beds, clean. Service at front desk particularly fine. The restaurant dinner really good and the service attentive and fast. </DOC> This was the best hotel I have stayed at in years. Which is surprising, since I am a top tier member of a major US hotel chain, and I never receive this level of service or food from that chain, (where I have access to the concierge lounge and all sorts of perks that I earn with 75 nights a year stays). Here, at the Legere, I got much better food and service, with no loyalty membership, just through a regular first time reservation. Makes me wonder why I have been loyal to that other US chain. I will now always search out Legere brand. This Legere Luxemburg hotel had excellent room service, welcome drink, nice workout area and sauna, fabulous breakfast, fantastic dinner menu, perfect room, free wifi and late checkout, on the weekend rate. Rates also great! Wonderful! And the staff were extremely helpful and welcoming. </DOC> Reception and bar area really cool, rooms basic at best , very very small and the bed is small and hard and uncomfortable , no robes , no safe , in fact very little , and in the middle of a business park next to the motorway , A very plain hotel , bed awful </DOC> Stayed here with my wife for one night en route to friends in Germany. The hotel is bright and modern and all the staff we met were friendly and helpful. The rooms are well-equipped and comfortable, and a bit quirky which makes them interesting. The shower was good and had reasonable power. One drawback is that the shower offers no privacy - the panel facing the room is clear. Not a big problem, but could concern some. We dined in the restaurant and had an excellent meal, well cooked and beautifully presented too. Breakfast was very good too, with a wide range of choices all presented well. Overall, the hotel far exceeded expectations at the price. </DOC> This clean, new an bit boring hotel is close tot he airport in the middel of an office park. There is a supercharger. The rooms are comfortable. No privacy in the room fort he person who takes a shower. The hotel is ok, but it is in the middle of nowhere. </DOC> We have just returned from a week travelling across Europe and this hotel was our last night before the UK. We were exceptionally well looked after, the staff, the rooms, the parking, food and drinks were pretty perfect and we will be back to get a better look at the sights of Luxembourg. </DOC> this hotel is part of a small group of hotels.the location is somewhat remote, although very conveneint if you need to be in the area.It is situated in the businesspark of Munsbach, situated between Luxemburg and Trier.Easily accessible from the highway. </DOC> Very friendly people, really helping and understanding. Only a pitty that they do not have a small kitchen available during the day. The 17.00 dinner is perfect. It's a very modern hotel with the same restaurant. The hotel as such is 24 7 open but far away from everything except the airport."
5,"Stayed two nights last weekend to celebrate a milestone birthday, the location is brilliant (reminded me of 'Ryan's Daughter'), rooms very comfortable but could use an update (but not enough to spoil the charm), staff are great, nothing is rushed (as it should be in rural Ireland), & breakfast is first class. The celebration dinner for 40 people was perfect, long & leisurely with good food & good company. All in all a perfect weekind in a really charming hotel. </DOC> We broke down near the hotel and the man in the garage recommend we stay a few hours in this hotel . The place was a hive of activity and it was a glorious day out so we dined out side watching the world go by for a few hours . Food was great staff very helpful and friendly . We would like to stay here in the future . A lot of foreign tourist around staying here so it must be good . </DOC> Had the pleasure of attending a family wedding here at the weekend. The staff were so friendly and obliging form the moment we arrived, every one of them seemed to love their job. The food was 5 star and the table service was so efficient with that west Cork friendly twist. The location has to be seen to be believed, </DOC> I thought the hotel was expensive at €180 a night for what you get. The rooms are below average - even for a 3 star. Very sparse and basic. It is now a non-smoking hotel - just an update on previous reviews. Breakfast was good. And the foyer and bar areas are very nicely decorated. Too expensive for what you get. </DOC> Spent a few days here for family celebration the food was excellent as usual, the staff are a joy, each more helpful, friendly and good humoured than the next. The rooms while a little worn are very comfortable. One major quibble the hotel needs to address urgently is the lack of a proper designated smoking area. smokers are forced to smoke at two of the front doorways, smoke is blown into the hotel area and was easily detected in the lower half of the function room during our meal. </DOC> Visited here a few years ago when passing for a bite to eat and enjoyed the cood so much we decided to stay here for a few nights and wasn’t disappointed. We had upgraded to a sea view and were pleased with the. View. Check in was quick, simple and friendly. Room was ample size but lacked a few essentials in this day and age I,e, a safe, mini fridge and air conditioning, but the Hotel were happy to provide a fan so that made up for the lack of air conditioning. Breakfast was simple and what we had was tasty but could have done with a little more choice.. Great choice on the lunch and evening menus and food cooked to perfection. Staff were so friendly and efficient and we would definitely stay there again if in the area. </DOC> We enjoyed a lovely lunch on route back to Cork. Food was well prepared and served fresh. Service was good & generally a pleasant experience. There was plenty of parking available, as well as outdoor dining if you so wished. </DOC> Myself and my partner stayed here midweek recently.The hotel was great value during the week, especially for West Cork in the Summer. The first thing we noticed was the friendliness of the staff who were both engaging and attentive. We had our dinner in the hotel that night. The food was great but I'd have expected high standards in this part of the world. The room itself was clean but possibly slightly dated. To be expected again as it seems a relatively old hotel. Absolutely nothing wrong with it though. No complaints! Great breakfast the following morning with good choice. Unfortunately we didn't have time to try out the leisure centre but maybe next time!"
6,"When I was checking in my son was a bit sad as I was staying there for business. The receptionist cheered him up and gave him a kiddies fun bag and said she had three sons so she knows how it is. I found that very warming and delightful of her to engage with him and cheer him up. My check in was smooth. Room was large with queen sized bed. I got a great offer. The leisure facilities are very safe, clean and adequate. Breakfast was very nice. There is nothing bad to say it definitely is a very well run hotel catering for all age groups whatever the occasion. I will definitely return with the family for a leisure stay next time. </DOC> The staff are fantastic. We arrived late after the kitchen had shut and the staff made sure that we got something to eat. the hotel is situated not far from Glandore and overlooks Rosscarbery Bay. If you are looking to go out at night, you would need to drive or get a taxi as there isn't much nera the hotel. A quick taxi ride will take you to Rosscarbery which is has a few bars and resturamts. The rooms are standard but clean. Breakfast was good.. Would recommend. Good value for your money. </DOC> Stayed here for 3 nights. Modern hotel built around medieval tower. Rooms are spacious, but somewhat tired looking & lacking in amenities such as a safe. Great view from our window- fascinating to watch the tide come in & out on the lagoon & bay. Staff is so friendly & accommodating. And the food in the restaurant is top notch- locally sourced, well prepared, interesting modern cuisine. Thank goodness for this because there are not many choices in the tiny town on the hill above the hotel. </DOC> Stayed here whilst on a ring of Kerry tour with Newmarket. we found the food pretty good even though we tired a little of the 'mashed potato with everything ' approach after 4 nights! Staff were friendly and our room was big despite overlooking a graveyard. on settling our bill the receptionist stated she would be deducting the sea room view supplement as we hadn't had one. This prompted me to look at my invoice only to discover that we had in fact booked and paid for a sea view room with Newmarket travel! As such , I will now need to get a refund from Newmarket for paying for a view i didn't get when in reality I should have been allocated the correct room in the first place - let alone almost being charged twice for the privilege!! Not ideal and such a shame as like previous reviews have said this hotel has such potential. </DOC> Pretty much said it all on top, the rooms clean with good wifi, rates reasonable. The staff are friendly and efficient, bar food menu quite good and breakfast served without any delays. </DOC> This hotel is in a fantastic location near the village of Rosscarbery, the lake and the beach. Ideal base for touring West Cork. The food is good although I was not too impressed by the cooked breakfast. The rooms are small but adequate, I stayed there for 3 nights in August 2014 while the family festival was on. The kids that I witnessed had a ball. </DOC> we stayed at the Celtic Ross for a weekend with our 2 month old son.....we had such a lovely time....the hotel is very child friendly which made our stay so pleasant. We had a lovely drive through west cork as well....some beautiful beaches which we intend to explore over the summer months. Will definitely stay again. </DOC> We called in here on our way to Baltimore for a lunch stop on our first day in the area. It was so delicious we wished we had also booked the Hotel to stay in instead of where we were staying in Clonakilty, the views were superb, hotel looked brilliant, but more importantly the food was so delicious we drove there 3 nights to eat instead of our Hotel. Their fish is all locally sourced and tasted absolutely delicious and the Sweet potatoes chips were the best we had ever had. The staff were so helpful and friendly. Everywhere was spotlessly clean too. Would recommend to all to call in, because you would definitely go back."
7,"We stayed for one night. Had a large room with a beautiful sea view. Large comfortable bed. Free wifi in bedroom. Facilities in room included T V , tea making , hair drier. We had dinner which was very good & served by very helpful staff. Good choice on menu. Had breakfast in the morning with several choices . Very enjoyable stay & would return. </DOC> Set in the Tower Suite with views of the Rosscarberry bay we indulged in what can only be described as a real foodie experience. Using great vintage mismatched pretty afternoon tea sets, we dived into a feast. Using locally sourced ingredients we were served with a Generous assortment of savoury sandwiches, dainty pastries, scones with cream and a mixed berry compot and delicious little pots of strawberries and cream......The Pastry chef should be congratulated........The service was friendly and attentive and the bonus was the additional harpist playing gently in the background. We were unrushed and able to enjoy a great experience - Thank you. </DOC> My family and I visited the Celtic Ross Hotel recently for afternoon tea. It was a great experience.The bone china cups were superb and the tasty sandwiches and dainty cakes were delicious. There were homemade scones with cream and jam which were great . We had a lovely afternoon. The staff were nice and friendly. We really enjoyed our afternoon. </DOC> Attended a wedding here. Was fantastic ! Didn't stay so can't comment on d accommodation! Got food here on d Sunday , carvery, it was lovely! I cannot compliment the staff enough - the friendliest ppl ever, made it feel so homly... The staff at the bar, reception, those working in the restaurant are all excellent ! Really thought they we're so hard working chatty yet professional . Before I wanted something the staff nearly knew it and had it for us on the table ! Myself and my friends all commented on how good they were and are a credit to this hotel ! 100% ! </DOC> Stayed at the Celtic Ross for three nights recently and found it to be a very comfortable hotel. Our room was on the second floor and was well equipped with plenty of towels, comfortable bed, tv and good WiFi. The furniture was a bit dated but was ok. Staff very friendly especially the reception staff. Breakfast was the usual fayre. We had lunch on one day and dinner on another night and both were very nice. Great location and plenty of interesting places to visit. Our only disappointment was that the leisure centre did not have a jacuzzi but had a bubble pool which was a bit on the cool side. </DOC> Having recently returned from a very enjoyable stay in the Celtic Ross Hotel, I just had to pass on our very positive comments. Overlooking the lovely estuary that forms Rosscarbery Bay, the setting is indeed unique. The ideal location really suited our needs as we like to spend time in the superb surrounding countryside that is West Cork, with it's beautiful coastline, magnificent beaches, & lovely towns & villages too numerous to mention. There is so much to explore in the area & we have been returning for many years, but this was our first time to stay in the Celtic Ross & we certainly intend to return. We stayed for four nights & enjoyed superb food in the restaurant, had a very comfortable room & the staff were first class, so we look forward now to a return visit in the not too distant future. </DOC> Had a lovely stay recently in the Celtic Ross. Room was comfortable. Massage treatment was great and fantastic value. Ate in the bar both nights - good quality food and reasonably priced. Roaring fire in the lobby when you get back in at night - perfect! Leisure facilities on the small side (pool a bit tired looking) and unfortunately the steam room was not working on the weekend I was there. Breakfast was great on day one. On day two we put the room service card on our door before the time stipulated on the card - found it was still there the next morning. After a couple of phone calls they did manage to get some breakfast up to us but wasn't ideal. Moral of the story - if you are going to make the cut off time for room service earlier than what is printed on your room service cards, please let your guests know! </DOC> Stayed here for a wedding in Glandore and the day was fantastic. The outside bar area is an excellent spot to view the inlet and enjoy sunshie (if you are lucky enough to get sunshine in Ireland). The staff were friendly and helped us check in a little early, but the room wasn't ready. It was a comfy bed - firm - and sleep was uninterupted by outside noise. The room was a little dated, but comfortable. The breakfast was ok, plenty of it and reasonably tasty. I left having a very pleasant experience of the place and hotel."
8,"A group of us decided to stay here after receiving an offer online. Check in was fast and receptionist Katie explained everything clearly. Rooms were quite large, clean comfortable beds. We ate in the restaurant two nights and found the food quite good. The hotel offers loads of additional space outside of the bar for quiet drinks. Only negative is that the hotel has no footpath outside its main door to the car park. We were pushing a buggy with cars passing closely. </DOC> This is a three star hotel in a stunning location which is a bit remote.Bedrooms are a good size but the beds are on the small side but comfortable nonetheless.bathrooms are basic but clean and everything seems to work,plenty hot water and constant pressure in the shower.tasty bar food and the breakfast was on the good side of average.Staff were friendly and attentive.This is a lovely place to take a break and the good weather we had made it moreso,will be back sometime. </DOC> Stayed a few times when I visit on business, not much near the hotel and I rarely eat in hotels so can't comment on food. Comfortable rooms and pleasant facilities. Easy to find and the village has some pleasant pubs and restaurants. Nice views across the lake </DOC> I went back to Rosscarberry to renew my childhood memories, the Celtic Ross hotel is in a beautiful spot and we were lucky enough to have a room overlooking the bay. The staff at reception were very welcoming and the rest of the staff were very friendly also. The bed was fairly comfy although I have slept in better, a lot of hotels are now putting toppers on the beds and maybe this hotel should also consider this. The breakfast was nice but not the best, prunes were a little shrivelled. The leisure complex was ok, the jacuzzi was part of the pool and as I am a non swimmer, I would prefer it to be separate as there was nothing to hold onto. However I would definitely go back to the Celtic Ross. I loved it, especially sitting outside on the terrace overlooking the sea. </DOC> We got married in the Celtic Ross in 2007 and always try to stay there for a night when visiting the area. We booked a midweek stay which was good value at EUR 90 per room per night including breakfast. Check in as always was very friendly and the room was of a good standard and we had a sea view. We ate in the bar in the evening and the meal was of a good standard and reasonable value for money. Breakfast was good as always with very friendly staff assisting. Rosscarbery is a very short walk up the hill and has a nice selection of pubs. </DOC> I attended a wedding and stayed in the Celtic Ross Hotel. The food and accomodation were great. The staff were very friendly and helpful.The views were marvellous and my stay was relaxing.The rooms were very clean and airy.It is a great venue for a wedding as the setting is beautiful. The variety of entertainment was great. The leisure facilities were great and spacious. The choice of food was brilliant and very tasty. The bar food was tasty and reasonable. </DOC> Great hotel& staff in a beautiful location. Excellent breakfast. Not far at all from center of the town. Traffic drives by very fast in front of the hotel on the highway so please watch your children. Swans and gulls across the street in the bay for children to feed...great entertainment. Aa lovely hotel with beuatiful surroundings. </DOC> This hotel is a great location for doing business in West Cork or a family break, it is very popular with Irish and foreign tourists, there are many enjoyable walks around a lagoon and around the sand dunes beach and cliff walk, the terrace outside the hotel is a nice place to stop in a sunny day. there is also a leisure centre if the weather keeps you indoors,"
9,"Restaurant overlooks the Rosscarbery Bay and is a close drive to Drombeg tourist attraction. I had the open faced ham and cheese sandwich while my husband had the pulled pork, both were good. The menu shows sweet potato fries but you can get regular if you ask. View was good, food was good, pint was cold. We did not stay at the hotel, just passing through for lunch. </DOC> Celtic Ross Hotel is next to the causeway on the main road just outside the town of Rosscarbery. The hotel's arrival must have been good news for the area, since stones were laid in the entrance by two different Taioseachs (a foundation stone and a completion stone.) We stayed over a Saturday night on our way from West Cork to Drogheda. Our stay coincided with a wedding reception, so we were able to sit in the bar and watch the festivities. The bar has a good coffee and cake service as well as the usual wide range of alcoholic drinks. We appreciated the service - from the welcome at reception to the relaxing time in the bar and the good evening meal and breakfast. I would go back there again. </DOC> We stayed here in July 16 for 3 nights and enjoyed our stay. We had dinner in the hotel one night and it was very enjoyable. The breakfast on the other hand left a lot to be desired with a limited selection dished out by a staff member. Every morning the fruit selection was depleted and limited cereals available. One thing that drove us from the hotel evening time was the amount of kids running and racing around your tables and chairs, climbing on the outside of a circular staircase and playing ball while everyone was trying to listen to the entertainment. The so called management would do well to stop this ""playing"" as it is an accident waiting to happen and a sure fire insurance claim. </DOC> Stayed one night mid week on a very good deal for Dinner B&B. Staff are lovely and very helpful. Food was delicious too. There were a few maintenance issues which I left on the comment card and were addressed in a email from the General Manger. Very good base for exploring West Cork - Baltimore, Union Hall, Skibbereen, Union Hall, Leap etc. </DOC> Hotel is in great location near a park and tennis courts so it was great. Looks like a fab hotel from the outside but the drabness of the reception and reception sitting area lets it down, it could be made much brighter and cosier. The bar area appears to have been refurbished and is very nice but my son and I found the food very tasteless. Room was average and fine for us, we didn't go to the leisure area so cannot comment on it. In a fab area but hotel very average </DOC> My Friend and I recently visited the Celtic Ross for lunch.It was very busy with locals and visitors like ourselves.There was a great selection in the carvery. I had lamb and my Friend had salmon. They were both tasty and delicious. We both had desert and coffee to finish. The staff were nice and friendly. We enjoyed our visit and will be back again. </DOC> Stayed here for a weekend Check in efficient Staff friendly and accommodating Rooms clean and bright and we had a fab sea view Dinner was lovely and also breakfast We will definitely be back Well worth a visit Well done to all the Hard working staff who make the hotel what it is 👌🏼 </DOC> I took my mother for lunch recently in the Celtic Ross Hotel and we were not dissappointed. It was quite busy. It was a nice day and people were sitting outside . We had a beautiful meal and it was quite reasonable. The staff were nice and friendly."
10,"The whole town is disappointing, nothing really there apart from the trails to hike around it. The rooms are small, the bathroom even smaller and it floods completely if you have a shower. Our room had a horrible view on a dirty and shabby inner court beyond which was the pagoda. By night there was noise in the corridor till late and in the early morning the pagoda began to send musical signals. We hardly slept. It was also quite stuffy with no air conditioning and only partial mosquito screen so that we couldn't open the windows. Breakfast was served by slow waiters and my poached eggs were hard boiled. Wifi worked very poorly but we are in the mountains and myanmar has no good net. The staff is kind, they carry your luggage upstairs (no lift) and give you advice on the sights. </DOC> From the outside the hotel looked quite charming and so was the dining room. Other parts of the hotel didn't fit the charm label so well. Lobby was small, hallways narrow, room was alright, had windows on 3 sides which was nice (2nd floor, in front) but the light from the hotel sign was right outside one wall of windows and it was on all night and the drape did not fully block the light. </DOC> Most people stay in Kalaw only 1 night. This hotel might not have the best ambience, but it's ok. Especially good value for the money, 43US . It has a fridge, tv, friendly staff. Rooms are clean and the bed is comfortable. The bathroom is fine. Good value. </DOC> During our stay in Kalaw we were in this hotel. According to the Lonely planet was this one of the best hotels in Kalaw. They could be right because I didn't see other hotels there. The room was very simpel and small. However the staff was very friendly and the beakfast was alright. In the hotel are no diner possibilities but a liitle bit further there is the restaurant of this hotel. I thought it was strange that they didn't mention this. We had dinner there one night and the food was excellent. The highlight of this town is the 5 day market which we missed when we were there. There is not much to do in Kalaw. </DOC> This hotel has a history! Loved the 'Villa' atmosphere, the wood, the walls, the rooms! There are some balconies available to sit on as well as the front porch area... wifi worked. The included breakfast was unique...not your usual buffet style, rather some local specials and some choices= made to order....lovely! Close to the main streets (not that Kalaw is that big....) ...restaurants close by. </DOC> I enjoyed my stay in this small friendly hotel. The bedrooms are a bit small but ok as i have had smaller in UK hotels, the bathroom is a small wet room with the shower fixed to the wall so beware water goes everywhere. I had a great nights sleep so was happy. Breakfast was a pancake with honey, fresh fruit and toast to order. Wifi was only available in reception or the small beer garden at the front of the hotel. </DOC> Friendly staff, lovely building. Room was small, but comfortable with dark wood paneling and sparkling hardwood floors. Bathroom was basic – mediocre shower and sink with separate faucets for hot/cold water – but clean. Breakfast included toast and eggs made-to-order – served, not buffet. </DOC> I stayed here for 2 nights as part of an Intrepid group tour of Myanmar. It's a lovely hotel that I would have gladly booked myself. Our room was lovely, very clean and comfortable. Staff were absolutely lovely. The best of all is breakfast!... it's amazing- fruit, pancakes, bread, eggs, juice, tea/coffee. Excellent. I would definitely recommend this hotel."
11,"We stayed here for two nights. The room looked nice and had complimentary water and fruit. At night it was very cold. We needed extra blankets and to sleep wearing lots of clothes. The bathroom is basically a toilet with a shower in it: lethal if you don't make use of the flip-flops. Breakfast is not a buffet but is served up to each guest, so there is not a huge choice. </DOC> We were made to feel very welcome at the Dream Villa by its friendly staff. The young girls who worked there were always pleasant and smiling and tried to converse with their limited English. The breakfast was simple but good and pleasantly laid out and served efficiently. Our room was quite large but felt much smaller because of it having 3 beds. We had a temple view which was lovely however on one night was noisy as the monks chanted till daybreak to signal the start of a festival – but that is part of the culture, so no complaints. The hotel offered different services including massages, I had an hours massage for the equivalent of £5, which was excellent value for money. Kalaw isn't a big place and Dream Villa is quite central and only takes a few minutes to reach most of the sites. </DOC> Good, better then average , local hotel. friendly staff and good service with good breakfasts. Front of house staff very helpful. Generally locL area has little to offer other than excellent trekking options so this hotel offers a welcome sanctuary. </DOC> Our room was a double an on the small side, the twins may have been larger. The bathroom was run down and we did not get the hot water the work fully, Luke warm. Under the bed had not been cleaned. Generally the hotel seemed run down, the reception staff were not overly attentive, the. Breakfast which we had in the garden was very good. Suitable for one night only but better options available . </DOC> Nothing much to say. Nice staff, our room was the best one ! with windows on three sides of the room ! The staff arranged a guide for us, friendly guy : Charles. Breakfast was OK. Good place to stay. </DOC> We arrived the hotel late in the day. We were given rooms nearer to the dinning room. What ever we asked as extras such as blankets, heater etc were obliged. Staff are fantastic and ever ready to help. As there is little activity to do in the evenings in Kalaw I wanted to catch up with news on the TV. There was not much of a choice. When I went to ask reception about the choice they connected me to a wider choice. So, the reception has an ability to control what you get to see. We were first at the dinner. We wanted sandwich for dinner as we have light dinners but it took a while to get them to understand what we wanted. The breakfast was the best in the tour. It’s a good hotel in a quite location. </DOC> A change in Myanmar with wood panelled rooms reflecting the almost alpine/Tibet feel of Kalaw. I had room 101 which had the disadvantage of being on the ground floor overlooking the outside seating area so a bit noisy. Breakfast is a set one with egg options but includes pastry, fruit and pancakes. The staff are delightful and it is centrally located. At 7 to 7.30 the monks from the nearby monastery do their morning alms run. Some have complained of the noise which comes via a speaker from a hill that overlooks the village and is inescapable in Kalaw. Hey its Myanmar OK </DOC> The staff were very helpful and obliging and easily understood our needs. The hotel is quaint - it really is more like a guest hose. Everything was clean and comfortable (well the beds were a bit hard). The bathroom had basic showering facilities - could do with a decent shower rose and a shower curtain. However we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Included breakfast was standard Myanmar eggs etc but was fine. Definitely recommend it for a short stay - its probably a 2 star establishment in terms of rooms and services but is very good if you are not looking for a resort."
12,"I loved this place, from the moment I stepped foot in the lobby and the staff were so helpful to the super cute towel animals on the bed, to the location (in the centre, but set back enough so that it's not loud)... everything. The rooms are super clean and spacious. The bed is comfortable and I had a great sleep. The breakfast - included. I didn't really arrange with them a vegan breakfast because I didn't want anything. They had plenty of fruit and I was happy with that. Brought my own dehydrated coffee and was fine. They have a water station so you can refill your bottle instead of purchasing endless plastic bottles of water. I really liked that. I'd highly recommend and I'd stay there again. </DOC> Dream Villa overlooks scenic mountains and is set on a quiet road in Kalaw. It is family run, with modest, clean and cosy rooms, and an elegant simplicity of life. Our stay was relaxing, charming and thoroughly enjoyable. Come to Dream Villa if you seek simple comforts, cleanliness and a friendly welcome - all at a reasonable price. </DOC> Basic budget hotel. Pros Drink and hot towels on arrival. Friendly clean, fairly modern hotel, nicely decorated. Cons Very cold room with no heating. Tatty shower/ toilet. No hot water. </DOC> We arrived from Bagan and wanted to arrange for a trek from Kalaw to Inle. At Lonely Planet’s recommendation, we stayed at the Dream Villa, which was located right in the centre of the little sleepy town that is Kalaw. It was nice enough, with pleasant staff, a lovely frontyard with flowers in bloom, and smiley staff. The room was basic, but relatively clean for backpacker standards. Wooden floors and a darkly tiled bathroom. Breakfast was served in the dining room next to reception and it was brilliant. Fresh fruits, hot coffee, pancakes, eggs and toast. I don’t think semi-luxury accommodation is available yet in Kalaw so Dream Villa might be the best you get here. </DOC> This hotel is simple and in need of refurbishment, but we liked its character, as it seemed in keeping with the area. Our room (301) was a bit small for two single beds and a cupboard, but it had windows on three sides so was light and airy. Bathroom good size, but in need of updating. Bedroom walls are panelled in pine and the reception area in teak. Free green tea always available in reception. Breakfast consisted of melon, eggs cooked to order and bread. Samosas are also provided although they forgot to offer them to us on our first day. Room had small fridge and there was complimentary fruit and bottled water in our room. Friendly staff. </DOC> Stayed here two nights with our Explore tour. The hotel is well situated in a quiet side road, but within a couple of minutes walk of the market and some OK restaurants. The en suite rooms are fairly simple and dated, but clean and with fridge, hairdryer and TV. Wifi (free) available in reception. Breakfast is simple but adequate – fruit, pancake with maple syrup, omelette and good (strong) coffee. Pretty good place to stay. </DOC> Looks OK from the outside, but of the two rooms I experienced, I wasn't really impressed. Location is OK, but tiny bathroom and no TV reception. The slow wifi is only available near reception, and that's if it's working, which didn't seem to be often. </DOC> This was a budget end hotel $35 per night, but was clean, friendly and the staff was helpful. Set in a wounderful mountain village of Kalaw"
13,"A basic place to crash for a couple of nights. Friendly reception; small room; typical wet-room bath/toilet set up. Located just a few blocks to everything in this scrappy little town. Free dawn wake up by the monastery next door. Luckily, the weather was cool so at least I had the windows closed to dampen the chants. Decent breakfast in a cheery dining room with nice servers. </DOC> Good sized rooms - ours had 3 single beds, and a reasonably good sized bathroom. Breakfast was goos with omlettes served to you at table. The rooms are a little dated with wood panelled walls but it seemed to reflect the mountain ambience. Beware the Monks start up at 6am. Fairly frequent power cuts. Has a seperate restaurant which others who ate there spoke well of. </DOC> Let down a bit by the slightly cramped dining room and table service at breakfast, but otherwise an excellent choice in the centre of town just minutes from the market and multiple restaurants and cafes. </DOC> This hotel was quite basic, but friendly and very well located in the centre of town. Tourists seemed to be staying here at the beginning of the two day trek between Kalaw and Lake Inle, so it had the unloved feeling of people passing through. That said, the rooms were cosy (lacking AC I assume because of the cool, hill station climate as much as anything). The pancakes were great for breakfast and the beer (like most things in the town) was cheap. Some of the accommodation looked decidedly dodgy and we were glad to be staying there. We did some local trekking and found it was very quirky and fun place to people watch, with almost a wild west feel (the locals certainly seemed to enjoy a drink!) </DOC> Well located in centre of township. Very friendly, welcoming and helpful staff. Service extended to supplying and filling hot water bottle - thank you staff! Clean, quiet, well serviced rooms with comfortable appointments and good bed. Room a bit small but light and airy. Dining area very pleasant and small but very attractive garden area. Fully serviced delicious breakfast cooked fresh. We had western food option only - were a western group - not sure if they had other options. Breakfast was plentiful and delicious. Weather was cold - it was winter - but staff happily supplied additional blankets. Would recommend and stay again. </DOC> Hotel looks great and staff are most helpful. Rooms are tiny though .. not even space for 2 cases. Bathroom even smaller with shower over toilet and everything gets soaking. Very warm rooms despite climate and very noisy .... get room on ground floor at the back. </DOC> Looks like a building from the alps. Very friendly owner with good English. Rose petals and elephant shaped towels on the bed. Windows can be opened to allow fresh air in. The breakfast tables are set with juice and fruit. The rest appears from the kitchen and is served at the table - eggs cooked to order, crepes and toast. Very hot water in the bathroom. Wifi hit and miss. Great lime juice on arrival and when we arrived back from our trek. They even offered to clean our shoes! </DOC> We were on the second floor, no elevator. Rooms were simple and clean. We had a corner room so lots of windows. The bathroom had a hand held shower over the bath which always find difficult to use. There were extra blankets in the wardrobe which you may need to use. Because of the elevation it is cool there in the evenings and mornings."
14,"Spent a night here prior to a morning flight back to the US. The location could not be more convenient. The hotel does not offer a restaurant for dinner but there is a huge selection of dining choices just a short walk away in the terminal building. The breakfast the hotel offers is quite good though. The room itself is adequate but a bit tired. Staff were very pleasant. </DOC> Since I had late arrival and early departure flight, I stayed there for two nights and switch to other hotel at downtown in between. If I have to come back Nagoya again, I would book all nights at this great hotel - great room size in Japan standard; directly connect to the terminal and train station (zero distance); perfect view over the apron and runway for high floor room. I will recommend Centrair Hotel to everyone. </DOC> Although the Double Room we had was small (not unusual in this sort of Japanese hotel), it was brilliantly laid out and functional in every way. Plenty of (and well -positioned) electric sockets, and lighting, comfortable bed and linen. Bathroom well designed to maximise space, good towels and amenities. A fridge (but no mini bar, although drinks available from machines on every floor). Surprisingly, for an airport hotel, there is no room service food. Although most of the airport restaurants close at 8pm, there is always the airport Family Mart offering fresh and tasty take-away food. Breakfast pretty reasonable, if somewhat simple. Not cheap at the almost US$200 we paid, but it has to be one of the most conveniently located airport hotels in the world! </DOC> Stayed for 1 night after we arrived in Nagoya, the hotel location was inside the terminal, only a few meters from the international arrival hall. The meitetsu airport bus stop also located near the hotel, just go down the escalator or elevator near the hotel you'll find the bus stop. We use triple room (actually it was a twin room with and additional bed) the twin bed size was quite big, the room and bathroom was clean. Breakfast was delicious with lots of varieties. Check out a bit early at 10am. Overall it was a good hotel with great location, will be our choice if we arrive in Nagoya a bit late next time. </DOC> Very convenient stay if you have connection flights early in the morning as the traffic from downtown Nagoya can be tough. The rooms are very comfortable and they are completely isolated from any noise from outside. Breakfast is a bit plain in a open space without charm. It is also lacking a nice lobby to have some drinks/snacks in the evening. Just leaving the hotel throught an indoor passage you get into the airport's terminal. Cannot be better. </DOC> I use this hotel when I arrive and depart from NGO. Just minutes to the airport by covered walk ways. Rooms are clean and large. There is internet via ethernet in the room, but like many locations no open Wifi. There is free wifi on the upper level shopping area of the airport a 5 minute walk. Many restaurants in the airport area as well as shopping. Train station is across from the hotel, also in a covered area. This hotels offers relief from the hassles of arrivals and departures, take a short walk to the hotel, relax and begin the next day refreshed. Front desk staff is efficient and very helpful. </DOC> Needed somewhere to freshen up while waiting for a connecting flight at Centrair, Nagoya International Airport. The hotel is a short walk from Departures/Arrivals and the shops/transport options. The reception staff offered a twin room for about £33, they were eager to please, the room was on the 5th floor and overlooked the airport, but there was no noise from outside. The room was quite big by Japanese standards 32m and very bright with large windows, flatscreen TV, Water heater with tea bags, fridge, slippers and lots of little extras. Bathroom, Vanity area/sink, toilet all separated by sliding doors. Also separated from bedroom by huge sliding door. Great hotel directly in the airport, - will difinately stay there again </DOC> Stayed 3 days on business, and found property to be quite pleasant. Staff could be a bit friendlier, but generally service was impeccable. Rooms are small, but functional in a very Japanese way. Bathtub is small but deep. Recommended for location and practicality."
15,"It is to the right, across from the Meitetsu train station as you walk out of the arrivals area. Very nice comfortable hotel with friendly, helpful staff. There is a convenience store as well as a café near the entrance to the hotel. Very good transient hotel if arriving late in the evening. </DOC> We just stay for one night on our trip to Shiga Kogen because of late arrival. We were greeted by a group of polite and efficient reception staffs. When I asked about direction to Shiga Kogen, they searched the itinerary in detail including the best timing. One of them even brought me to the train station across the foyer to make sure that nothing was missed. The room was clean and tidy and beds were comfortable. Breakfast was average. Meeting. Such nice people really adds bonus for your journey! </DOC> We stayed here to catch the early flight out of Nagoya airport and we were not disappointed. Firstly we saved one hour of sleep due to its proximity to the departure lounge which is just 5 minutes away. Secondly the room was quite spacious and modern with a large bathroom with a bathtub n another Japanese style pre-shower area for pre wash before u get to soak in the bath tub. Sheets and towels were clean and wifi was strong. There was free tea/coffee making facilities and each lift lobby has an ice maker. It's location just walking distance away from the airport terminal building makes it ideal to do last minute shopping and also search for dining sites. Reception was typically polite and ever helpful. Can stay if you need to save Travelling time from downtown for early flights. </DOC> Unbeatable location for those who need to stay by the airport. Spacious and clean rooms, convenient store right downstairs and steps away from train station. Better quality than other airport hotels I've stayed in Japan. Price of room is also very reasonable. Highly recommended. </DOC> A very typical Japanese business hotel with small room and tiny bathroom. WiFi/internet connections were adequate, bed was comfortable. Sound proofing was good, nothing was heard from outside. Nothing very unusual, however, 2 major plusses: * very conveniently located adjacent to Chubu International main terminal * excellent breakfast </DOC> This is my return visit and my friend's first experience of an airport hotel. We were very pleased with our room and the seamless connection with the terminal and trains. In fact, as the hotel rate was very good and the Meitetsu Sky express train very comfortable and fast, we thought it might be a good base for travelling in the region instead of being at Nagoya station. </DOC> Really comfortable hotel that adjoins the Nagoya Airport. It's literally a short walk from the lobby to the Departure area. All indoors. Comfortable rooms and they even provide a Night shirt which is very convenient. The bathroom is spacious with all amenities except a shower cap. We stayed on a high floor and had a nice view of the sea and the runway. It was surprisingly very quiet - We could see the planes taking off but thankfully couldn't hear them. Breakfast buffet is decent and good for a quick meal. Highly recommended if you have an early flight out as we did. </DOC> Just what the doctor ordered for a tired traveller.Excellent facilities for a passenger from a long journey.Everything is there except news in English on TV. Breakfast good.Can speak english reception;but knows little Remember loook for a red ATM for exchage. Others will not do the needful"
16,"This Hotel is on the Trafford Centre complex and recently built it is a short walk from the Trafford Centre, Event City, LEGOLAND and Sea World. Rooms are typical of the brand and clean and spacious as expected. Decent Bathroom. Breakfast is the brand's standard limited buffet but well cooked and kept stocked up. </DOC> Great bed lovely shower. Breakfast improved. Little things like iron and board in room now Only downside room still being cleaned when returning in the evening Much improved brand having had a less than great night in another one </DOC> Well my work booked this for me and all I got was a postcode and did not realise just where it was. However it's a great location if you want to go to the Trafford shopping mall. This is a fairly new hotel so as you would expect it is in first class condition. A funky modern style layout and feel. There is plenty of parking which is controlled and secure. The breakfast is good and plenty of choice . Filled my belly. </DOC> Not recognised as a gold member Receptionist cold and stand offish Barman did not speak English and could not take food order Food poor and waited-despite chasing 4 times-20 for desert Staff don’t interact between themselves or with customers Not your typical HIE </DOC> This new hotel is breath of fresh air and so different from other Holiday Inns.From the moment you walk through the door into the very modern reception desks to the bedrooms and restaurant you find a spotlessly clean hotel.The reception staff were excellent and check in was fast and efficient.The rooms are amazing comfortable beds excellent bathroom they also have an ironing board and iron in the room.The price also includes a very nice breakfast cold and hot items are available and served in pleasant surroundings.Ample free car parking is available.The situation of the hotel is first class and just two minuets from the M60 motorway and on the doorstep of The Trafford Centre.If you wish to visit Manchester City centre I can recommend the X bus which passes the hotel and takes about 15 minuets or so. A wonderful hotel with a very dedicated and hard working team of staff. </DOC> Stayed in this hotel recently. Its right next to Trafford centre and motorway network so really handy for commuters, with a large car park at the back too. The team are pleasant and friendly and there is a small gym which is not the norm for an express hotel. </DOC> Stayed one night and found the hotel catered well for us. Hotel is spotless and rooms are usual holiday inn express which means you know what to expect. Clean and comfortable room. We caught a bus just outside the hotel for the city centre and got one back about midnight. Bus stops just outside hotel. Easy to get to the motorway too. Glad we chose it and would definitely stay again if in the area. </DOC> Well what can I say such a wonderful friendly hotel. It was spotless. Staff lovely and very helpful. Breakfast was very filling, loved that you could go back for more and more and more. You can even have a take-out if you wish. Bed so comfortable, slept all through the night. Did not want to get up."
17,"Brand new hotel in great location. I love the new room layout and style, really relaxing evening, good bar and restaurant with basic but adequate menu and good breakfast. The staff are tremendous and very friendly from reception right the way through the stay to departure. Free parking and walking distance to the Trafford Centre. I will be using this hotel again when I am in the Manchester area a great new find. </DOC> Our second stay at this excellent hotel. Comfortable, quiet and spacious rooms with excellent shower, breakfast continually restocked, staff helpful and friendly. A 10 minute walk to the Trafford shopping centre and a newly opened pub/restaurant next door (excellent carvery). The new tram line to the Trafford centre is still under construction but buses to Manchester centre stop right outside the hotel. There is a direct line for a taxi service at the reception desk, a bar for a nightcap and plenty of parking spaces. Cannot fault this hotel and will be staying again to visit family in the area very soon. </DOC> Stayed for a few days after a bank holiday weekend (more on this later). Hotel is very new and in great condition - staff very helpful and pleasant. Room was nice - good quality mattress and choice of pillows. Just across the road from the Trafford Centre and close to the motorway. Good nights sleep every time. Breakfast is included but for a few of the days there were no eggs - when asked the reason given was 'we have run out after the Bank Holiday, very busy'. Tuesday am perhaps but this went of for a couple of days. C'mon Holiday Inn Express, eggs can be obtained easily. Apart from this small glitch I am happy to recommend and would stay again. </DOC> The newness of the hotel is complemented by the hospitality of the staff making this a great place to stay. The rooms are well designed offering all the amenities and space you need. My only criticism would be the lack of a proper desk if you need to work (there is a wheeled, movable tray-like table instead). Being a new room there are plenty of power points, most with USB sockets so great for recharging phones etc. Breakfast is standard HIX fare but perfectly adequate to start the day. It is 5 minutes walk from the Trafford Centre, so there are plenty of alternatives for Dinner </DOC> Hotel was very close to the Trafford Centre and only 15 minutes from Manchester airport. Staff were friendly and helpful. Room was clean and had everything we needed. We would definitely stay here again. </DOC> This is a great hotel for visiting the area with friendly, helpful staff and great facilities. Spacious Great Room for breakfast, etc. and just chilling out. Bedrooms are well-equipped and a very good size. Short walk to Trafford Centre and Event City and none of those parking hassles. </DOC> Virtually next door to Events City this was ideal for our visit to an event there. The Trafford Centre with all its facilities ate a short walk away. Friendly staff, decent facilities including a gym and a good choice of breakfast as you would expect. Seems a very new building. </DOC> Use this chain all the time but first time I have used this hotel, right next to the Trafford Centre shopping precinct, this is a brand new hotel with really well appointed rooms (as a new hotel for example this means USB sockets in every wall socket etc.) and spacious, airey, public areas. A large version of the HIE franchise, 5 storey hotel with over 200 rooms, very busy, which makes it busy on all fronts, bar, restaurant and check in etc. but well resourced in terms of staff levels so no issues or problems."
18,"Brand new. Good service. Spacious rooms. Car park was full when I arrived which was amusing given it is a new hotel. The bar and cafe area are sterile and built to last. Rooms are great. Very comfortable and loads of space. Good value. I will be back. </DOC> Stayed here for the night before an early flight from Manchester. The hotel is about 15 minutes drive away on the M60 / M56 and was a lot cheaper than on-airport options Conveniently situated on the periphery of the Trafford Centre with all of its shopping & entertainment, this new-style Holiday Inn Express was clean, well presented and staffed by a friendly and helpful team who even managed to let us enjoy a continental breakfast at 5am despite the fuller inclusive breakfast not being officially available until 7am. The only slight downside is that the area outside the hotel is a complete building site once as there is major work underway to extend Manchester's Metrolink tram network to this area. Nonetheless, highly recommended - I would definitely choose to stay here again. </DOC> stayex here 2 nights very immpressed hotel is fairly new and very modern and clean its a ten min walk to trafford centre so great place to stay if shopping leave car and walk will be back if in this area easy reach of m60 be great for an overnight before going to manchester airport </DOC> Great hotel, friendly helpful staff, lovely clean room , very comfortable bed. Breakfast was ok, had better but have had a lot worse, plus it was very hectic & struggled to get a table. But I would definitely use this hotel again and would highly recommend it </DOC> On arrival I found the reception staff to be far from welcoming, as a regular IHG user I can only compare to other arrivals. Even on departure they lacked the Manchester warmth. Rooms are good, modern, clean although lacked the chair for desk work. Sofa sufficed. Wifi good for email checking. Breakfast good, very heavy on the salt on the scrambled eggs but does the trick. Wouldn't rush back but wouldn't object to staying again. Would also comment noisy door banging neighbours did disturb my sleep. </DOC> This is a brand new hotel (summer 2017) so is very clean and well presented. My room was big with lots of room, quiet and comfortable. There is plenty of car parking on site. Wifi was free and good quality. Breakfast was good. The bar in the evening was the only disappointment, very slow service and no craft ale on sale. </DOC> Nice modern hotel - good rooms, breakfast & safe parking. Walk to & from Old Trafford takes about an hour each way which is longer than we expected! Staff very efficient and pleasant! Wi-fi very good. </DOC> I stayed here for one night for work. Very easy to find with free parking. Modern, airy, fresh design. Made for leisure and business travellers. Large rooms, spotless and friendly staff. 5 mins walk from the Trafford Centre. Highly recommended and if this is a blueprint for future hotels then bring it on!"
19,"This was our second stay at Tingle Creek and it was just as good as the first. The staff are very friendly, helpful and relaxed, the rooms are clean and spacious and we liked the breakfast buffet. The hotel is in a great location looking out to Skye and it was nice to sit out in front of the hotel with a beer looking at the view. (the midges were not too bad) The hotel is quiet and relaxed and we had no complaints </DOC> Well equipped,clean and comfortable providing a fresh room and a terrific bathroom.Breakfast was good traditional fare.The owner Andy is a bit of a character who is ever wiling to help and never walks if he can run! Beautiful setting a few minutes from Plockton which must be one of the most exotic villages in UK. </DOC> This was our first hotel on the NC500 route. It is a little difficult to find being about two miles north of Kyle of Lochalsh on a minor road. We had a nice ensuite room with a view of the Loch. A speciality of the house was about 50 whiskies to choose from at the bar. There was a good choice of hot and cold food for breakfast, and evening meals are served 5 days a week - check beforehand which days. </DOC> Very comfortable hotel, friendly owner and staff. Nice bedroom with pristine en suite. Fabulous view from the dining room, unfortunately our bedroom view was of the service area and two fuel storage tanks! Ask for a sea view!! Breakfast was an excellent buffet with eggs cooked to order. Dinner was less successful, a bit rich for us and huge portions. </DOC> We were recommended to stay here by friends. We were very happy with our stay but missed out on dinner as it was on one of the evenings with no dinner available. ( Sad after the good reviews.)To his credit, the owner did warn me before my stay and I followed his recommendation in booking an excellent local restaurant on line before departure. The rooms are modern and clean if a little small. Check also if you have restricted mobility, there is a narrow and fairly steep stairway. The place however excels in the space on the ground floor, the dinning room has marvellous views over the creek and there is a very pleasant lounge area. As other reviewers state the location is in very convenient location for touring. In addition it is bike friendly: what more could you want? </DOC> If you have your own car, this will be a great hotel to stay in on your vacation to Skye. It has a great location with peaceful surroundings. Rooms are clean and decently spacious. However, the hotel was slightly difficult to find, does not have a 24 hr menu so in vase you are getting in late, have your dinner before you get in. This hotel is all about the location and deserves 4 stars for that! </DOC> This was the last hotel we stayed in during a group holiday within the Outer Hebrides. The location was stunning, the rooms very pleasant and comfortable & wonderfully clean. Andrew was helpful and attentive, the food was really good and the bar had an impressive array of about 45 whiskies. Having been extremely careful to avoid midges all week with success I was very dismayed to find the window in our room had been left open during the day. As it had turned wet that day, I feared the worst. However, Andrew was right; the midges had not got into the room after all & I arrived home after a week in the highlands midge-bite free. Bliss! </DOC> The Tingle Creek Hotel is located a few miles from the bridge to the Isle of Skye as well as from the popular Eilean Donan Castle. A nice family run inn in a very small village provides a well located base to explore this fantastic area of Scotland. It is a modern facility with good sized, well appointed rooms many with views of the Isle of Skye. There is also an excellent dining room and large public sitting area / bar. The family certainly makes you feel welcome. Wifi was not working when we were there due to an outage by BT. Mobile phone service can also be a bit spotty here. But don't you come to this area to get away from all of that modern technology? This was our second time staying here and the standard has been well maintained."
20,"We really liked our room and the view was just right after a long travel day from Colorado. The mattress was great, amenities were generous, and there was even advice about Highland midges for newcomers. The room had very little soundproofing, though. We were too weary for dinner, but decided to have dessert. If there is one dessert menu item that must be perfect in Scotland, it is sticky toffee pudding. In my opinion, if it isn't great, just say you are out of it. Ours was either past its prime or had been reheated once too often or for too long. The servings were somewhat brick-ish but the yummy sauce almost saved the day. The breakfast was typical fare for a small hotel. The host was very friendly and good-humored. </DOC> We didn't stay at this hotel but it was really near our bed & breakfast place so we decided to eat here at night. We had dropped in for a drink earlier in the day and the hotel looked as if it served good food. We were not disappointed, in fact both our main courses - seafood chowder and venison, were fantastic. You will struggle to find here unless you seek it out, stay at the hotel or our B&B. Can't fault any aspect of eating here and we witnessed one of the best sunsets we have ever seen from our dining table. Well done to the staff at the Tingle Creek. </DOC> The hotel is okay in itself but there are two things that make it worthwhile staying there: the location and the staff. The hotel is situated in a small village (the hotel acts as village pub too) a couple of miles from the Kyle of Lochalsh the dining room affords fantastic views of small island. The staff are fantasic and nothing is too much trouble for them. They are friendly, helpful and attentive. The breakfast is buffet style but is fresh and plentiful, I would say they have the best black pudding I have ever tasted. We stayed for 3 nights and when in the area would definately stay again. </DOC> A nice homely place to stay .The owner very friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble. We had a meal which was thoroughly enjoyable and breakfast the next day .It was just a bit of a shock with the road only room for one car .Would not have liked to do it in the dark. The only downside is there is no WIFI . They say the whole area is like that. </DOC> This is a 1970s era hotel in a really quiet location with great views over to Skye. Being from the modern era it lacks the character of some of the old little hotels but the rooms are comfortable, moderately sized and very clean. The main bedroom corridor is lined with stories of the Scottish tartans which is a bit disappointing as you hear the creaking of floorboards as people move up and down reading the scripts. The hotel has free wifi. The food is quite good if eating in although the dining room is dominated by a recessed dance floor which is very 70s. A comfortable place for a night but that was enough for us </DOC> Can't add much to the one liner above! Family run hotel, nice friendly staff, good food and a super breakfast, nice views too. </DOC> A beautiful little inn in a beautiful place. The rooms are modern with good bath. The bed had a bit of a ""tilt"" however. Nice public areas. The owner is very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was a good Scottish breakfast. Unfortunately the restaurant was closed for dinner the nights we were there. Decent internet access. </DOC> We stayed at the Tingle Creek Hotel for 2 nights during a recent driving holiday around Scotland and would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a clean, comfortable, welcoming place to stay that's close to the major sights but in a quiet spot. Our room was clean, the bed comfortable, the included breakfast good, and the free wifi worked well. Everyone at the hotel was friendly and helpful, and we would happily stay there again. A hidden gem!"
21,"This is the place to stay if you are visiting the Isle of Skye. Use this as a base. Great View from room, Great View from restaurant. Fantastic staff and family that run it. Fantastic price. Excellent in every way. Nothing to fault. Hope to return one day. </DOC> Breakfast at Tingle Creek was very good. Our room was well appointed and very clean but too small. People who design these rooms seem to forget travellers have luggage. Those travelling a long way may have a full-sized suitcase each. By the time these are open and the superfluous cushions that decorate the bed have been put somewhere, there is hardly room to walk around. Best to get a room with a view of the loch, which is marvellous. Rooms on the other side look at, well, nothing. We had a pleasant and helpful welcome from the staff. </DOC> The hotel is in a pretty spot, with nice flowers and a view to the water. The man at the desk was very helpful with suggestions for routes the next day. We didn't have dinner there; breakfast was fine. It was a busy holiday weekend, and we were glad to find this hotel. We'd certainly stay there again. Finding it was not hard - the management emailed us directions. </DOC> Wish we had stayed here more than 1 night - what an amazing view from the hotel. Comfortable, very clean room; lots of easy parking out in front, and very friendly staff. Nice seating area to enjoy a Guinness (or something else) before dinner, and the food in their restaurant was a real delight. This hotel was recommended to us when our original choice on Skye was booked up - we feel we lucked out and were very glad we ended up here instead. </DOC> The hotel and breakfast were fine and the reception good enough. The problem was that on Tue/Wed there is no dinner in the evening and we had travelled a long way; we did not want to go out in the car again and drive after wine with meal. The room was simply not good enough quality for the money, although it was newish. The bathroom was good. Wi-Fi was down. </DOC> An interesting hotel with a slightly eccentric feel! The room was adequate, clean and attractive with a good modern bathroom and nice toiletries. The food was good, especially the local seafood and chef's use of fresh herbs. The best thing about the restaurant was the view of the sunset so do take your camera with you to dinner. The restaurant layout is unusual because there is a sunken dancefloor in the middle of it! Looking at the photos of weddings held there I can see how that feature would appeal when there's a party in full swing, however, it just feels a bit strange at breakfast time to be looking across a dancefloor! </DOC> This hotel is quite isolated and a vehicle is required to get to shops, restaurants and tourist sites. It has a large free carpark. The staff were young, pleasant but inexperienced, especially in the dining-room: for example, I was served a dish which was different to my order, and rather than apologise and return with the correct dish, there was an awkward discussion with two staff about whether I should be happy to just consume the incorrect dish. We had an upstairs room with a view of a domestic yard. The tariff was high given the hotels isolation and the ordinariness of the rooms and facilities. </DOC> Just outside Kyle of Lochalsh, this family run hotel is a very good choice for a stopover. The restaurant offers a splendid view of the Isle of Skye. As a guest, Andy and Morag Bates takes very good care of you with the help of a young and attentive staff."
22,"We were in Birdsville for one night and tossed up whether to eat at the pub or not but glad we did. It is worth the visit as the meal was very good as was the service. If you find yourself in Birdsville just passing through, eat at the pub, you won't be disappointed. </DOC> We stayed in a room for one night after the Simpson Desert. The hotel has a very interesting ""must see"" pub. The food took a long time to be prepared, but was worth the wait. We were given wine on the house because of the long waiting time. The staff were very friendly and the room was great. Good mattress on the double bed, great shower and bathroom. The room also has coffee making facilities. All in all, a great place to stay over. </DOC> Stayed overnight as part of a DownUnder coach trip and what a surprise. After a long and dusty road, the bar was a welcome sight as we downed our drinks and marvelled at all the hats and other artefacts that adorn the walls and ceiling. The locals are friendly and welcoming as are all the hotel staff, here and in the restaurant. Accommodation was far better than we had expected ... rooms are ample and reverse cycle a/c, bed comfortable with plenty of blankets, clean well set out en-suite. Dinner that night was excellent ... even though extremely busy, the standard of food and service was high as was breakfast, with dishes continually being filled up. If travelling that area, treat yourself to a stay at the famous Birdsville Hotel. </DOC> Again, as in Innaminka the motel accommodation was a pleasant surprise considering the remoteness. Motel rooms a duplicate of Innaminka and they were clean and tidy. Bathroom small but adequate. Staff very friendly and the meals were very good. Well done to the staff. </DOC> We stayed two nights on our APT tour in a motel unit behind the hotel and found the unit to be comfortable and clean with a good shower. The hotel has a lot of atmosphere with two bars, a large restaurant and an even larger outdoor area serviced by the restaurant. On cooler nights you can sit around an open fire while having a drink from the bar. Food for dinner and breakfast were both very good. Enjoy the stay and soak up the atmosphere of this outback town. </DOC> To celebrate our trip we all decided that a few drinks and a feed at the Birdsville Pub was in order. This far out your expectations are not high. In fact the food we all received was good and there was certainly plenty of it. The staff were helpful and it was a pleasant night out. </DOC> We stayed at this venue as part of an organised photography tour and thoroughly enjoyed it. The hotel itself has a fantastic character and the rooms were surprisingly good. Large rooms, recently refurbished, air-conditioning, TV - what more could you want (in this part of the country)? The rooms were clean and well maintained, we had no complaints at all. The food in the dining room was good and plentiful with plenty of variety to suit any palate. Highly recommended. </DOC> I recently visited Birdsville for business reasons and was accommodated in the iconic hotel. As a seasoned traveller to many parts of Queensland, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of rooms which is better than many outback pubs. Motel rooms are clean and cool with easy access to the airport, information centre and post office. The dining menu was extensive and suitable for this outback location. A highlight was the buffet breakfast which was plentiful and inexpensive."
23,"A last minute one night stay here, and it was a great night. The motel rooms were excellent and the bar and meal was a great experience. For this location, it certainly beats many city and town motels! Well done all, and all the staff were friendly and certainly seemed to be thoroughly enjoying themselves also. </DOC> Arrived by plane as part of a small tour and stayed the night. Tour of the town first with Kevin from Desert Edge Tours then drinks and dinner in the pub. The pub was as iconic as all the pictures show with a large range of interesting characters there for drinks. The meal was well presented and tasty. The hotel room was spotless, the bathroom fine - all utilitarian as expected in such an isolated place, but we had an amazingly quiet sleep even though the rooms were all full. Large numbers of people in very dirty vehicles back from the desert but everyone must have been tired and sleeping early. A great experience to remember. </DOC> Any outback pub is an experience that I look forward to. Locals and the staff are always open and friendly. The accommodation here was very good. Clean airconditioned rooms with en suite facilities.Food was more than adequate and possibly the best in town. Do avoid the race days </DOC> The Birdsville Hotel is one of the most famous pubs in Australia. It also features motel style rooms which are modern, air conditioned, clean, comfortable and a great place to relax. The meals at the pub are typical pub meals. Generally, they are good value with large helpings. I ordered my steak medium-rare and it was close to well done however this is typical of country chefs as they often cannot understand how you can eat steak unless it's ""really"" cooked. The next night I tried the Penne Bolognaise pasta and it could have done with a bit more tomato flavour through it. Birdsville should be on everyone's bucket list and this pub is a must see. You really must have a cold beer in the bar! </DOC> Visited Birdsville last weekend and was very impressed with the hotel, the rooms, the meals and the overall vibe. It was a great experience and something we have always wanted to do. Well done to the operators on the clean facilities and well kept surrounds. Certainly much better than anticipated. </DOC> The ambience was exactly what I had expectyed at the Birdsville Pub. Fantastic! </DOC> After crossing the Simpson Desert it's very good to have a real bed and enjoy a warm shower. We stayed here for a night and found the room basic but clean and tidy. You have everything you need (except wifi but you can get mobile coverage). Meals are also quite basic (we were there on Pizza or Ribs night) but there's nothing wrong with them. A good honest motel that is an outback icon. Washing down the dust with a beer is a must of course. </DOC> It's always a pleasure to return to Birdsville and its iconic pub. The air-conditioned rooms are simply but comfortably furnished in a style that suits the desert environment They offer all the essential comforts of a city hotel room. The staff are welcoming, as are the locals and fellow travellers in the corner bar. We enjoyed the ""Sunday Roast"" dinner. Portions were huge. We were disappointed that breakfast is served in the dining room only when large tour groups are staying. We declined the offered a breakfast tray to prepare in room and ate at the Birdsville Bakery. The bakery was not nearly as good as the breakfasts we have enjoyed at the hotel on previous visits."
24,"The hotel is designed with the kids in mind. My 7 year old and 2.5 year old cried their eyes out in Colombo asking to go back. The kids pool with the slides are fantastic. The kids playroom and kids activities they have scheduled are all good. The golf course is amazing and very well maintained. The rooms are great. The toilets with the rain showers are fantastic. The only reason for the 4 stars is the food. It was certainly not up to mark for me. The restaurant 'sera' was good but the main buffet food got a bit boring. The staff were very good. Will definitely be back </DOC> We stayed for 2-nights during our Tour of Sri Lanka & the Shangri-La was unquestionably the best hotel we stayed at during our trip. The location is stunning, the staff helpful & friendly & the food excellent. Our room, with its sea view, comfort & cleanliness, could not be faulted. We played two rounds of golf & despite the course undergoing significant renovation we thoroughly enjoyed both. The course certainly provides a range of challenges! All in all a thoroughly enjoyable experience so thank you all! </DOC> Like some of the other reviews it’s a mixed bag. There’s lots of good things but the worse part was the main restaurant at night it was chaotic and we thought even those there was lots of food we felt it cantered more for the Sri Lankan people, the hot dishes only showed one chilli but for us it was very hot where we thought should show more than one also the lids were not being put back down so food was getting cold no one showed any care for the food that’s just us maybe. I did play golf and it was a short course also a bit rugged in parts. </DOC> I recently stayed at the Shangri-La hotel in Hambantota. It is a very large resort with many facilities and activities every day. The thing that stood out for me was the staff. Everyone was friendly and respectful, especially to my local Sri Lankan friend who was staying and travelling with me. The food was very good especially the breakfast and the meals in the Golf Club Restaurant excellent. The hotel is right on the beach, so an early morning walk before breakfast is a must. The only small suggestion I have is that as I was checking out there were many people trying to check in, and all of the staff were busy checking people in. I had to wait sometime to check out. You need to have at least one checkout station dedicated to people leaving. Otherwise a great 3 night stay. </DOC> The hotel is large with over 300 rooms in several blocks and the land area is vast with several pools, golf course and activity centres. All that seems to make it impersonal although the amenities provided were luxurious. The beach is long with no other hotel in sight competing for it. Somehow the place didn't make us feel that we should visit again - that may be because all four of us were on the wrong side of 72 and younger persons with a yearning for activities and golf would enjoy it more. It rained while we were there and the rain water splashed on the long corridors making them very wet and slippery. The eldersly should make note of that. </DOC> Without doubt the best hotel in Sri Lanka, the hotel is set in a stunning location just outside Hambantota. Serene, idyllic and pure luxury! If you want a treat at an excellent value for money, this is the hotel to book. We stayed for 4 nights and were sad that we were not able to stay longer. Staff is friendly, professional and accommodating - genuine service and always tried to go above and beyond for every request we had. Breakfast was excellent! We will be coming back soon.! Thank you for a wonderful stay. </DOC> We stayed two nights. The hotel is big and suites are spacious. There are three swimming pools which kids can enjoy well. Lots of activities for kids. You can try from 4 differ restaurants. The food spread is limited. Staff is really good and attentive . </DOC> Wonderful service at at this newly opened Hotel on the beach with great facilities! Perfect for family getaways being close enough to Yala for an animal safari and equipped with trapeze and heaps of activities as well as the Golf course. The food was great at the restaurants and the staff wnet out of their way to make sure you were looked after. Highly recommended!"
25,"Very nice property. But service is not up to par. Perhaps hard to fill occupancy. Seems to be cost cutting going on. Spa was excellent. Very dry grounds and difficult for them to take care of landscaping. Very far drive getting there. Would choose a different option in the future. </DOC> A very good hotel rooms are good.The bed is very comfortable. Eveything is new a new resort.A very good selection of of activities.The service is very poor staff needs more training is customer care.Lots of staff hanging around but no attention to guests same at the restaurant also. </DOC> The Property has been developed very nicely with lot of recreational activities for the family. However 2 areas of improvement or suggestions. One is that the Golf activities are chargeable & should be included in the Room package so that the guests can enjoy & utilise the facilities.The other is Food quality. While the spread is huge, the quality and taste leave much to be desired at that level. </DOC> Located apart from busy traffic, in a huge private park by the beach. As a quite new resort everything is modern and well functioning. Decoration is timeless and airy with taste of elegance. Young staff is most motivated with friendly attitude and high class know how. Spacy rooms are equipped with latest technology for maximum comfort. Eating options are versatile and atmosphere is relaxed and pleasant. Gym was also topical and executable. </DOC> Apart from being a very family friendly resort with tons of activities for kids and adults alike (golf course on the resort), one of the very pleasant features is the distance from the nearby airport on which e.g. FlyDubai operates. Hotel reachable from airport in about 30-40 min only. Resort itself is brand new with kids area, family pool and adult pool. Food is good and with a good variety/selection. Service could be improved. All in all a very pleasant stay and totally recommended. We will go again for sure. </DOC> We will give this hotel 6-point if the scale allows. Excellent free wifi everywhere but you won't have time to surf the internet. The hotel facilities are so enticing. Pools, pool with slides, public beaches, hammock all over the green facing the sea, excellent gym, spa, numerous playrooms for adults & kids, free daily activities including golf & circus classes. It is wonderful to spend active and relaxing days in such a nice environment. Foods and beverages are good. The coffee served over breakfast is really good. Room is comfortable, clean and well-decorated. Tips: make sure to book a room at 1/F (ground floor) facing the sea. Thus, you have instant access to the pools & beach from the open balcony of your room. </DOC> We stayed here for one night on our way from the west coast into the deep down south jungles of Sri Lanka. We were initially told that this was a hotel built for large conferences, but when my family and I reached this mega size hotel we realized they have built a hotel for the families. This is a very large hotel, spread across many hectares with numerous entertainment for children including water park etc. This hotel also has a fantastic golf course that is spread across a vast and beautiful land over looking the ocean and a lake. They have beautifully designed restaurants and bars, very well trained staff and top notch global and local chefs who prepare truly amazing cuisine. Though it was a short stay for us, we enjoyed every moment of it. </DOC> Well, to have good golf, best kids activities, good food and very nice beach, as well as great pools, there is not a lot around southern of Sri Lanka, we have been to some already but they missing the good golf and Kids staff, this place is really good, service is great and nice staff trying always hard to make it happen. We have great time"
26,"We visited for 6 days over Christmas with our two daughters and family. The place is wonderful. With so many rooms it was like being on a cruise ship! Plenty of activities and places to visit. The rooms were excellent, the whole establishment was in excellent condition. The restaurant offerings were outstanding. As it was Christmas the seams were at bursting point, and there were a couple of occasions when it was difficult to get the 8 of us together at the table to eat. We also found the service slow in the Club restaurant. It was also a little disappointing to have conference room chairs and tables set up to accommodate the large numbers of people in the main restaurant. </DOC> Spent two days as part of an office retreat. The location is simply fantastic! And there is so much to do - you would never have a boring moment. And nothing beats just chilling in front of the ocean - you could easily spend hours :) The staff services were quite efficient and professional. </DOC> Beautiful resort located on the beach and a short drive from a number of attractions. There are three pools within the resort including an adult only pool for travellers without children. The resort is large but very easy to get around. Landscaping is excellent. Service was always attentive and friendly. Our room overlooked the pool and ocean, and was beautiful with a large terrace. Food was hit and miss, some meals were excellent, most were about average. I think they place too much emphasis on having large and varied menus rather which is similar for many resorts this size. Also disappointed that there is no fresh juice at breakfast. Overall a very relaxing stay with options to relax by the pool or take in some local sights. </DOC> Beautiful hotel located close to the beach . The place is very kid friendly and the kids had an amazing time at the pool and also the play area. The cool zone allows parents to leave the children under good supervision while parents can go and do their own thing, The service and the knowledge of most of the staff was below expectations, servers had no idea how to prepare a table for breakfast etc the lifeguards at the pools were rude and were aggressive . The sea in front of the hotel is a bit rough hence not much of sea time can be experienced The gold course is amazing a must try! </DOC> This is our 3rd visit to Shangri La this year. Because of its quality, service and food, we kept coming here. The pools, giant chess board, recreations centre was great for family activities. Played Golf and had a great time there. The coaches there was fantastic. The hotel upgraded us to Ocean view Premier Room, which was really nice. As usual, the rooms was luxury and the breakfast buffet was the best with food for any one. Visited Yala from there where we saw a bear. </DOC> It is a great location and wonderful atmosphere. It has been made to very luxurious condition. The rooms are beautifully done and very comfortable. Most of the staff members try to give their best service. The front office, house keeping staff are very courteous.But some of the staff working in the main restaurant are very rude to guests and they always force the guests to finish the meal fast and restrict to the closing time. Somehow they try to send the guests out from the restaurant before the restaurant closing time.They never allow guests to enjoy their meals. The management has to correct this bad practice very soon. Otherwise it will tarnish your whole hotel impression. </DOC> Spent time with friends in Sri Lanka and made a stop at shangrila Hambantota. Great resort that is spread out over many many acres. Nice breeze blowing the whole time. Rooms was comfortable and spacious and staff extremely helpful. Restaurants were very good. We each had a spa treatment which is actually a gorgeous little spa at the resort. Our massages were in outdoor villas beside a little pond which was very charming. We will back again soon Sri Lanka as there was just too much to see in one week. </DOC> Resort offer an array of amenities. Spa, gym, many pools, beach access and one of the few golf courses in Sri Lanka. Offers two restaurants and two bars, which I felt was one restaurant short for such a rooms. Although the hotel must be 300-400 rooms it feels quiet as the property is spread out and people congregate around pools closet to their rooms."
27,"As this property was opened recently and despite being a Shangri la, there are a lot of small details that do not correspond to the standards. The property itself is beautiful, well located, the rooms are great, but there are improvements to be made regarding the F&B. The staff are amazingly gentle, but need more training. Very nice to have met Rodrigo, who's in charge of the sports animation. </DOC> Thank you Shangri-La for a great stay this Christmas. A wonderful Hotel with great service and lovely food. The decorations were fantastic and the facilities are overwhelming, we particularly enjoyed the silent pool and Golf Course outdoor dining area. Well done and thank you again ! </DOC> Doing a tour of Sri Lanka and India and my friends stumbled across this relatively new hotel. What a little gem. Quite a large hotel with amazing pools including a salt water lap pool which no one uses. They have the most incredible spa with classic Ayurveda treatments that we all tried. Very nice. Food was great and good course amazing. No one was playing which was great for us. Saw lots of wildlife through the property and also on roads leading to resort. Is about a five hour car ride from Colombo. Half of the road is a super highway and the other half a well maintained windy windy road which slows you down. But all in great shape. Beaches exist at this property but are not the type that you could ever swim in due to big waves and forever blowing wind. Go check this place out. </DOC> I really liked to give this hotel 5 points or even more (which isn't possible), but too many construction sites,are open. I must assume it is still soft opening period, but for that, it is just too expensive. Staff is extremely helpful and friendly, but if they had a negative answer, they just didn't come back. Although facilities are tremendous, a negative point is airport transfer from Colombo. We needed six hours including traffic jam. Hope the new highway will be finished next year, and this will improve seriously. </DOC> The place is majestic. 3 pools and one with a water slide. Excellent place to visit with young children. Pool bar location is breathtaking. Rooms are average compared to the other parts of the hotel. But the rooms are comfortable. True to its name the spa is expensive. The staff is very friendly. Breakfast buffet was great with lots of varieties. The hotel design is excellent and tasteful. A must visit hotel </DOC> Flew from Dubai looking for a long weekend stay in a getaway resort, It's a 30-minute drive from Hambantota airport (flydubai destination) and you will get a great deal if you use entertainer vouchers to get free nights. Lots of activities can be done (Flying trapeze was a unique existing activity to try). Hotel is on the beach but you can't swim there as it is very rough, though you can go for a walk on their pristine red sand beach, they also have multiple pools to relax. Multiple dining options are available that you won't need to leave the resort for the whole stay. </DOC> The entire resort is amazing. The rooms are great, plenty of space with every amenity you could imagine. The grounds are kept in excellent condition and are lovely to walk through. There are 3 different pools, slides, and more places than I can list for you to sit and relax. There is a choice of restaurants for you to have dinner, all with inside or outside seating. The service is wonderful, everyone we met was so friendly and helpful. I also went for a treatment in the spa which was excellent. Very professional and reasonably priced too. Thank you for a wonderful stay. </DOC> Excellent hotel and great experience. the rooms are quite new as this was a newly constructed hotel, and the views are brilliant. the constant breeze that blows through is simply awesome during hot days of July. When we checked in, we agreed on my room package and there was a misunderstanding. After eventually an email to the GM, they called back and resolved. WHich shows their customer first attitude and excellent client service.. this gets 4 stars as i think for a 5 star luxury hotel, their food options in the main dinning area could be better and also not serving pizza thats not well cooked! However that being all said, i would certainly visit back as these will improve over time! if you are requesting rooms, request a room with sea view.."
28,"People know what to expect with a Holiday Inn Express and this one was no exception. Pleasant room, comfortable bed and a simple buffet breakfast. If it was me I'd add a few more fruit options at breakfast but I expect they know their regular clientele. Service was good on check in and departure with friendly helpful staff. After departure we realised that we had left a phone charger. Called the hotel, they checked with housekeeping and located it. Furthermore they posted it on with no charge - excellent customer service and the reason for rating this stay very good. Credit to their organisation. </DOC> I was here on business and stayed twice. The staff were friendly and helpful and the rooms clean and comfortable. Breakfast was more than enough. It was quiet too. I did ask for an extra blanket which I didn't get at first but then I asked again and got another duvet. Not that the rooms are cold, it's just me! I got the tube to Walthamstow central then the 97 bus, got off in front of the Greyhound Stadium and walked 3 minutes to the hotel. Very good value for a hotel in London too. </DOC> As HIX hotels go this is above average, it was very easy to find next to the greyhound stadium and a Sainsbury supermarket. Parking was easy and the reception desk quick and efficient. The rooms were what you would expect as was breakfast the next day. There is nothing much around the hotel but the very helpful receptionist organised a taxi for us to take us to a nearby Indian restaurant. All in all a good budget hotel and i would recommend it. </DOC> Stay here for one night on business. I often use holiday inn's and for me this was not one of the best. The room was very basic, nothing spectacular with a view of the local sainsburys car park. Air conditioning had a mind of its own and the cleanliness of the room was average. Breakfast was disappointing by holiday inn standards a very basic hot and cold buffet with barely any hot food. Staff were pleasant enough but weren't very visible at breakfast. Will not be returning in a hurry </DOC> We stayed near the Heathrow airport in London in January and then we spent one night here so we could visit people we knew in the area. I have stayed here before and still found the place a bit tricky to get to. Its a good job the Sainsbury store is next to it. Check in was quick and easy, plenty of parking, decent room and breakfast was slightly better than the HI Express I stayed in Edinburgh a few weeks earlier. For the price, good value. </DOC> The hotel is in a handy location for the main roads but there is not much else nearby. There is a large car park with free car parking, and although close to the roads I was not disturbed by any noise. Staff were very friendly, efficient and helpful during my stay. They seem well organised which helps when wanting a quick check-out. The rooms are the standard HIX set-up with all basic amenities provided. Breakfast was also fine - a good continental selection plus a few hot options too. Would recommend if you need a cheap hotel in the area. </DOC> The hotel appeared to have been taken over by the Canadian swimming team and their families, the Olympic village was not far away and the atmosphere was great. Lots of free parking as the hotel is ajacent to Sainsburys car park, not the greatest visual surroundings but next to the North Circular London ring road, you need a car for this hotel. Rooms and hotel facilities are the usual Holiday Inn Express standard, clean, effcient, welcoming and all round good standard and the price was good for London. </DOC> Great staff, small hotel ideally suited for the Ching ford /Walthamstow area All the usual facilities, room big enough , very clean, nice nest bathroom. Tea making facilities in the room Ample car parking out the front."
29,"We used this hotel as it was a short ride to the start for the Prudential Ride London 100. Easy parking and the staff were all very friendly, happy for me to sleep with my bike in the room. They started breakfast at 0500 and even offered an earlier start if necessary. Brilliant start to the day. As to the ride wind and rain, nothing the hotel could do about that. </DOC> Stayed here as a family after a day out in London. We had enjoyed our stay here before a couple of years ago, so was looking forward to getting to our room after a busy day and vegging out. Parking was good, lots of parking space near the entrance. Check in was quick and professionally done. The room was a good size and thank god for the A/C. Room temperature was comfortable very quickly. Clean and modern room, bathroom the same. Good night was had by all. Breakfast provided in the morning was perfect. Nicely cooked and lots available to choice. Again we have enjoyed our stay at this location. The staff are always friendly and helpful. Without any hesitation we would stay here again. </DOC> Business meeting followed by an overnight stay. Good if basic facilities but the food in the evening was mediocre. As a group we didn't have time to look for anywhere else and I don't think one should judge the hotel on the quality of that one meal. Breakfast lacked bacon (only sausage) but otherwise a productive stay. Excellent strength free Wifi and comfortable bed and very good shower </DOC> After three progressively worse nights in different Holiday Inn Expresses over the last week I was fast losing faith in the brand, but a night here has reminded me that there are some jewels amongst them too. Friendly staff, ample free parking and decent dinner menu available. Room was standard HIX offering. </DOC> This is one of the best Holiday Inns. Staff always make you welcome, especially Manuel and Alexandra! Thank you. Room always clean, I always sleep well. Breakfast is always excellent and what is also good and NOT on the website is that they have an excellent restaurant which serves from 6.30-9.30pm I had a superb beef and ale pie and my partner had a chicken Kiev with salad and peas! The Merlot was superb and this HI is one of the only places that knows how to serve wine at the correct temperature!! Excellent disabled parking and facilities - really excellent! </DOC> My 3 children and I had another great stay at this hotel. The staff are very friendly and sincere. The room was very quiet and comfortable. Great breakfast to start the day and my boys love staying here. Thanks to all the team. </DOC> A reasonable HIE but would benefit from refurbishment. The rooms are a little tired in all areas and needs modernised. Only stayed once at this hotel but paying £100+ I expect more. Not much around the hotel so unless you have to stay here I'd suggest looking elsewhere </DOC> A good holiday in tbh. I had a disabled access room (for no reason) and it was more than big enough for a pleasant stay. Bed good, TV standard free view type. Bathroom was a wet room with the now legendary (in my eyes) 3 corner sink with mirrors.... am I really that rotund????? Reception efficient too. Breakfast included, as in fairness you wouldn't pay for it. Scabby old bacon ( I know the management will say you only need to ask, however; I shouldn't have too)! Sausage, scrambled egg and beans also available. Coffee was good, as was the orange juice. Gets a 4 out of 5 and that's really for the room. If I put the food into the rating it would be a 3. Good value though in fairness, I would use again and more than likely get breakfast elsewhere."
30,"The Reception staff were wonderful. The checking in and out was very friendly and efficient. We had a little crisis with my 3 year old daughter who bashed her head and drew quite a bit of blood. They were so helpful and really went out of their way to help us in any way possible. The rooms were immaculate and the air conditioning worked really well. On the breakfast front, the quality of food was good and the staff worked really well to ensure the serving area was kept clean and re-stocked. Well done to all involved and a big thank you from us. </DOC> Expensive for what it is an Express Plenty parking on site Breakfast usual and ok A Sainsbury store next door for food shopping if you want Not too many other food outlets nearby and you would need to drive </DOC> This is a regular place for me to stay and I'm pleased with some of the changes but like an election campaign it comes with a trade off The addition of bacon on the breakfast offering it appears was paid for by the loss of quality and flavour of the sausages. The ability of the restaurant staff to spot a dish that has been emptied on the buffet seems to have gone astray The lift not working is unfortunate but this happens, the staff on the whole work hard and are always welcoming Beware now there is a height restriction of 2.1m to enter the car park All in all 7/10 </DOC> I always stay here when visiting family or on business. The standards are very consistent and staffed by a fantastic team of staff throughout. My children love the place. You always know exactly what you're getting and ideally placed for travelling about. Thanks to all of the team. </DOC> We stayed on a Friday evening and nothing was too much trouble for the staff, who were friendly and accommodating, especially the manageress. We normally hate to eat at hotels but we decided to eat in the bar area and it proved to be as good as you would expect at a local pub and prices weren't too expensive. As usual with Holiday Inn Expresses, the room was clean and spacious perfectly adequate for our needs. We had a comfortable and uninterrupted sleep which we weren't really expecting given the proximity to the North Circular! </DOC> Excellent staff, quiet comfortable room. Had a family room for 2 adults and 2 children (1 double and 1 sofa bed) Marred only by noisy guests in the corridor late one evening, and a 1.30 am fire alarm! Breakfast more than adequate. Excellent value </DOC> Located on the North Circular but well glazed! Great bar with very friendly staff who make for a good atmosphere. Located right by Walthamstow dog track so great entertainment if you are a solo business traveller (£1 entry on a Tuesday!) Right next to a Sainsburys & the take away Indians that deliver to the hotel are good. </DOC> I am regular user of hotels within IHG and this location is always good. Greeted by Barbara and Steve who were both professional and welcoming and my children think they are great. Thanks to the entire team at Chingford."
31,"This is one of those places that doesn't really need to be here - but it is. Last time i came here some years ago it was a bit rough, but now it sits in the middle of a huge sainsburys car park within sight of Walthamstow Dogs (now defunct) handy for Enfield and - erm... well Enfield really. Bog standard - somewhat overprices hotel with good rooms, quiet at night and a poor version of a continental breakfast - with sausages and powdered eggs on top. evening meals are available midweek and the one I had was actually ok but they are all from Sainsburys next door I imagine. Buy stuff there and microwave it. not much else to say - the staff were very nice - most pleasant and efficient, not locals then! handy for buses into London. </DOC> We enjoyed our stay here.Ideally situated for a visit by car . On the North Circular and plenty of parking . A really excellent welcome at reception from Carole . The rooms at every good .Clean ,comfortable and quality linen .Excellent Wi Fi and tea making facilities. The only downside for me is the Holiday Inn breakfast . I know it's free but it does not compare with that at similar hotel chains. Fresh fruit ,natural yoghurt , good bread ,bacon and so on .All missing..I would rather be given the choice of paying for something of quality The breakfast room itself lacked something . Quite cold and stark. If you have the time visit Lloyd Park and the William Morris House in Walthamstow. Only 2mls or so away. Gorgeous . </DOC> just stayed on a short break and must say the hotel is clean rooms good size and well cleaned the breakfast is excellent the hotel is near to bus in to centre of London also easy to get to from north circular road </DOC> This is located just off the north circular so handy if you are in a car but not if you are on foot. It is also located quite a distance from the tube. Staff were nice and friendly and the room was just what we expected - neat clean and tidy and all in good condition. Nice TV as well. The bed was spacious and firm - a bit too firm for me and not as nice as the new Premier Inn ones. The room was quiet and air conditioned and we had a good night's sleep. The included breakfast is quite nice. Free wifi as well. We will go again and recommend it. </DOC> Stopped here for the night as visiting friends and family in the area. The hotel is really nice but you do need to drive. It's got a nice little bar and the staff are very friendly and welcoming. The rooms are nice and quiet and breakfast is free and plentiful. Definitely worth a visit </DOC> Stopped as every year for just one night. Great rate if booked well in advance. Good room and breakfast - just a pity they don't have the restaurant open at weekends - but Sainsbury's next door. Very easy access </DOC> Excellent accommodation and by booking early got the right price. Quiet room at the back and very clean. Food as with all of these chains is only average but I wouldn't grumble. Car park with a large Sainsbury store adjacent. </DOC> What a great hotel! Great rate when booking in advance for a family of four. Stayed over night as a stop over when visiting London Zoo the next day. The room was very clean and well prepared. Comfort level was number 1 and all had a good sleep. The free breakfast was superb. The staff were extremely helpful and courteous. Very professional. I would absolutely stay here again and highly recommend as a perfect stay."
32,"Bed room was not very well cleaned stayed for two days and hairs in the bath room from the previous ocupant when i was there pest control was checking the room Bed Bug? Breakfast was very bussy used by a lot of Coach parties. One to avoid if you want a clean room or some were to sit for breakfast </DOC> This hotel has very friendly helpful staff and offers great customer service, the location is right next to the north circular, this didn't make the hotel noisy surprisingly. The car park is opposite a Sainsbury's superstore . The food was below standard and tasted very manufactured and mass produced. </DOC> Plentiful free parking, rapid check in by efficient, friendly and well presented reception team. Room in good order. Courtesy call from reception about 30 minutes after check in to make sure I was happy was a nice touch. Got in late after a night out - comfortable bed with good pillows and a duvet appropriate to the season. Room dark, and at a nice temperature thanks to efficient and quiet air conditioning. Missed breakfast because I slept so well - no noise, no disturbances. Decent shower and supplied shower gel, and out of the door and on the M1 in no time. Couldnt ask for more. </DOC> I needed to go to a party in Walthamstow, but didnt fancy sleeping on a sofa. I booked the Holiday Inn purely as somewhere to sleep. I was impressed. Easy to find, easy to park. No queue to check in, efficient staff made the formalities easy. The complimentary bottle of icy cold water was welcome Clean room in a good state of repair. Cool (air conditioned), quiet (despite the main road outside) and dark (black out curtains). I slept through breakfast, so can't comment on it. </DOC> I booked this hotel as a gift for my partner with the sole purpose of the trip being the greyhound track in walthamstow.. it is literally right across the road!! There are no more hotels in the area and this one is more than enough..Expected exactly what i got from the holiday inn standard! Clean comfortable rooms. Read a couple of reviews before i left and the only negative point anyone mentioned was that it is out of london. Yes this is true however it is a very relaxed hotel with the bus stop across the road that will carry you to the Selbourne walk shopping centre (has all your high street shops) and the markets outside if you feel the need for shopping. There are a few nice restaurants in walthamstow. Other than that the area does'nt offer much else. However we really enjoyed our 3 night stay in the hotel!! </DOC> 1st time here and very good Holiday Inn. Free parking and free WiFi. Good bar and restaurant selection. Very friendly staff always ready to assist you. This is the difference from a good hotel and an excellent one. Well done. I'll be back </DOC> This hotel is a good example why it's right to keep using the same brand! A perfect example of a Holiday Inn Express. Alexandra on reception was fantastic.... she was lucky enough (!) to check me in and serve me at the bar and she was great. Location is brilliant, right next to a Sainsburys which was good for me! Breakfast was very well done - sometimes a little lacking in other HIE's. Parking was plentiful. I'd definitely use this hotel again. </DOC> Stayed her for a night and got it for £46. great price and breakfast was very good to. Would stay here again if the price was as reasonable. Staff were very good at getting all of our Family situated together."
33,"+staff where very friendly +room used for wedding was fantastic +bar was reasonablely priced +bed was comfy +hotel is very clean +there are veggy sausages available at breakfast if you ask for them -room was very dated and smelt slightly of what my grandads house used to smell of -breakfast staff got pretty much every order slightly wrong - meat on breakfasts appeared low quality -walks between rooms and hallway offered no soundproofing at all </DOC> My husband and I stayed for two nights on a Travelzoo deal - £99 bed and breakfast, and a three course dinner each. We had a most enjoyable stay, and enjoyed the food. All the Staff were good too. My husband played nine holes of golf and enjoyed the snooker room. Our room was comfortable. We went on two cycle rides and explored Cirencester. </DOC> We visited CHH for our firm's summer dinner. This was our first visit and we were pleased that the choice of a new venue did not prove to be a bad one. The pre-dinner fizz was enjoyed overlooking the stunning views at the rear of the property and the staff were friendly and attentive. The meal was very good, starting with a cheese and onion amuse bouche (one of the party thought it was too cheesy), the main courses though were enjoyed by all, I, like a number of us, chose lamb which was beautifully cooked. There was a good choice of puddings and the cheese menu was very good, just difficult to choose just 3 from the list. Liqueurs and coffee finished off the evening nicely. Overall a good choice and I am pretty sure that it will be added to the small number of venues for our biannual nights out. </DOC> The latest in many visits here. The staff are obviously well trained and above all friendly which makes such a difference. The food, whether it's in the restaurant or from the bar snack menu, has always been of a high standard with attentive maître d'. The 'full English' and breakfast in general really good. Rooms, both in the hotel or in the courtyard are clean and comfortable. The swimming pool is nice and warm and facilities generally good. Even the background music is discrete and highly suitable for a generation growing up in the 60's!! We will certainly return and have, in addition, already booked up for our annual reunion in March 2015. Really a case of the cliché: 'Don't tell everyone about it as we don't want it to become overbooked'!! </DOC> We visited this hotel for a function and did not stay here. The hotel was well appointed and in a lovely setting, The staff were helpful and the buffet was well presented. However we did have to ask for pepper and salt to be put on the table and had to ask for sugar to be provided when we had coffee and tea. </DOC> This time, on one of our annual/regular visits, they have obviously taken note of previous constructive criticism although the place is still in need of general refurbishment. The staff even more pleasant and helpful and after years of issues, they are making a conscious effort to man the bar all the time. Big improvement. Yet again, no Worcestershire sauce!! The menu looks a bit mixed but the food was very good and well cooked. Waitresses and bar staff friendly and mainly efficient. The swimming pool roof has now been mended. In general, the whole place had a more positive feeling and we'll return yet again! (wondering why they've put naff obscuring plastic squares on the main staircase windows!!) </DOC> We stayed here for one night and only paid £60 through Late Rooms. The hotel is a little old fashioned, but in a good way. The room was large, bed very comfortable, towels etc luxurious, TV had Sky Sports 1, 2 and 3 (!). Leisure facilities first class - lovely pool and jacuzzi, superb full size snooker table. All the staff very nice and welcoming and the hotel generally felt warm and very comfortable. Only criticism is the very limited menu and the cost of dinner. Prices are equivalent to very very good restaurants and, while food was very nice, this is not a very very good restaurant. Also, have really tortuous way of taking your order etc, Went down at ten to 7 for a 7 o'clock booking and didn't get to the table until 7.45 (we were only the second couple seated). </DOC> We were both very happy with our rooms which were in the annexe of the hotel. No 6 particularly was lovely. Staff were friendly and the hotel grounds beautiful. Dinner and breakfast were excellent. Not safe to walk to Cricklade due to busy road with no pavements."
34,"This hotel on the outskirts of Cricklade is something of gem which we found by accident and have since re-visited. It has a plethora of facilities including a spa, indoor pool, and golf course (9 holes). The public room are very comfortable and a vast conservatory with wonderful views to the south is the place for coffee or lunch. The staff are cheerful and helpful but the man of the match is the Chef. The quality of the cuisine exceeded our expectations the first time, but now we dine here fuelled by anticipation. The menu is imaginative and splendidly presented.The cost of a three course meal served to **** Hotel standards is at pub prices. Recommended to readers of Trip Advisor We cannot comment on the rooms as we live only ten miles away and have not stayed here but </DOC> Unfortunately we only stayed for one night as we were attending a Christmas function, our room was a nice size but, a little dated but ok. The evening meal was excellent, all three courses being very tasty, the breakfast was also very tasty, and I have a feeling that it was freshly cooked when ordered, not a problem when you are not in a rush, and it ensures your breakfast if hot and fresh. All in all a short but very enjoyable experience. One slight hiccup was at 11.30pm I ordered a drink at the bar but the till had been emptied and I couldn't pay in cash, I had not registered a credit card on booking in, having decided to pay cash during my stay, so it had to be booked against our room, unfortunately on checking out I was asked to pay for two drinks although I had only had one, slightly irritating but easily sorted. </DOC> Nice clean room which had recently been refurbished with lovely new bathroom. Breakfast was lovely and plenty of choice My only suggestion for improvement would be that as the shower cannot be adjusted in the refurbished bathrooms a shower cap provided by the hotel would have been really useful but other than that a lovely place to stay. </DOC> Stayed here on a Travelzoo deal for one night on a Thursday night. What a lovely hotel. Stayed in a room with a balcony which cost an extra £20, but would not bother with that again. Very nice conservatory area to sit in and excellent food in the restaurant. The manager and his two waiters were a credit to the hotel and the chef too!! The pool was pleasant but I agree that the roof is in desperate need of renovation. The rooms are comfortable with newish bathrooms and fluffy soft towels. Woulddefinitely return here again at the right price. We were in room 41. </DOC> Lovely grounds and a nice old building with lots of charector. Nice snooker room as well as gym and pool. Only had bar meal which was fine although the veggie burger was kind of strange with mushy peas, didn’t expect that but it was actually tasty. Our room faced the car park but not complaining as it was a decent size with a decent tv. WiFi worked but just for browsing and mail anything else it struggled. Breakfast good but the best was the coffee, it was probably the best I’ve had for a long while at hotels. Paid £65 and tbh it was worth it and would like to try and go back for the summer if we are around. </DOC> Stayed here for 2 nights whilst visiting the Cheltenham race festival and had a very pleasant stay. The rooms were clean with crisp white sheets and comfortable beds making for a very good nights sleep. Bathroom had large fluffy white towels but I was a bit disappointed with the power of the water from the ECO shower. The food served in the restaurant was very good indeed well presented and full of flavour. All staff very helpful and friendly with check in and out very swift. </DOC> This was our second visit to this hotel and it was great. Our reception was very friendly and helpful. We were on a 2 night half board break and were informed that there would be a reduced menu. However, as there were 4 choices for each course, this did not turn out to be a problem. Sam, in the bar on arrival, was very helpful in reserving the table that we asked for and even arranged it for our 2nd night when he was not on duty - thank you, Sam. The meals we had were excellent (I had venison - one of my favourite meats) and very well cooked and presented. Serving staff were very friendly and helpful. Buffet breakfast was plentiful, although a bit cool on our first morning (we ate later than normal); up early on 2nd morning and food was hot. Would certainly stay again. </DOC> Absolutely loved this hotel for it's grounds, the view from the rear terrace and conservatory, and the amazing restaurant. Staff were all great. The room we stayed in (38) had an old mattress where you could feel every spring unfortunately so made for a poor nights sleep. Would definitely recommend a visit for the restaurant and drinks on the terrace. Would have to opt for a different room (not all seem to have the issue of room 38 so in a different room, might have given an excellent score)."
35,"This is a small hotel/lodge/golf course that has clearly had money spent on it during recent times, and we could see that upgrades/maintenance is still ongoing. I would describe it as a pleasant 3-star hotel/motel that is a preferable option to a Premier Inn, and not so very far from the M4 as to be out of range. It is certainly a little faded in places, and (for instance) the shower head in our room (45) needed replacing badly, but all criticisms have to be set against the fact that for somewhere between 50-70 pounds you can get a nice double with breakfast (which was top-notch). A good value for money option in my opinion. </DOC> Called in here for a light lunch and was not disappointed. Friendly staff and beautiful views. Food was good and so was the service. Hotel is full of character, eat on the terrace or on the restaurant. Would definitely go again </DOC> Attended a Christmas party at the hotel. It was clearly very busy that night with similar events but be service was pretty good with courses arriving quickly. Starters were ok, although I didn't really enjoy my white onion velouté but that is probably my taste buds as it was well made. Turkey main course was good with nice vegetables on the side. Chocolate tart for dessert was the highlight, really rich and delicious. Mince pies with coffee were bought in which was a shame. DJ was playing a good selection of music, not your usual party tunes. Compared with one Christmas party nights this was definitely better than average. </DOC> My family and I had a great Sunday lunch here in August, the food was very good, the service was very good, we had preordered food so all served in good time. The hotel is very nice, a lovely lawn leading off the conservatory, really well kept and nicely appointed. Very relaxed atmosphere after lunch as none of the staff rushed us with tidying up, offering coffee and time outside and in the conservatory. Good range of drinks in the bar. </DOC> I was there for an overnight business meeting with about 50 people. They do this well. Parking and accommodation is fine and the large function catering is good. Although I wasn;t paying for the room - only the bar - prices seemed reasonable. There is a spa pool and golf, if you have the time. </DOC> I stayed here this week in one of the rooms in the courtyard. Looks like it has had a makeover apart from the bathroom. Large room, perfectly comfortable if a little basic. Very quiet with lots of friendly staff. The bar and breakfast area are a little like going back in time. Would stay again for the odd night. </DOC> Had a great weekend over bank holiday at Cricklade House. Last minute decision to get away and found this lovely place close to Cirencester and only half an hour from Bourton on the Water and other pretty villages. Hotel is set in countryside with great views. Stunning looking building and great food, service and facilities. Swimming pool has good view too. Steam room and jacuzzi great - only negative I can think of was the pool was very cold.........digital display said 27 degrees but it felt much less. We had read some reviews which were not very complementary but for what we paid it was perfect and yes a few of the ceiling tiles in the pool area were stained but no big deal and otherwise excellent. Full english breakfast was great with masses of choice and nicest croissants we have had. Will certainly visit again. </DOC> I went for afternoon tea with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday. We sat outside on the terrace, it was a sunny day and the view was gorgeous, it was possible to see for miles. The afternoon tea was sandwiches, cakes and champagne at £12.50 a head, which was good value. The staff were attentive and friendly. I would go back."
36,"Lovely night away in suite 88. I had arranged for bubbly to be in the room and nothing was too much trouble. We ate in the restaurant and the food and service were excellent as was breakfast the next morning. Some comoments on here mention that the hotel is tired. I disagree it is an old building and the furnishings are in keeping with the age and style of the building. </DOC> Last minute business trip so consulted TA for hotels close to Shrivenham and for whatever reason very little availability on closer places so opted for Cricklade House and so pleased we did Managed to get fantastic deal through hotels.com at 75 per night in a fabulous room. Beautiful location, very traditional establishment with friendly and attentive staff Rooms peaceful, clean and spacey ..highly recommended Restaurant staff stayed later to allow us to eat which was appreciated.. Next trip will definitely take an extra day or two to enjoy the scenery. </DOC> Myself and my boyfriend stayed at this hotel after our friends wedding. The room was quite big and lovely. Bathroom was modern. We were happy with the room and it had a lovely view of the grounds. The actual hotel is beautiful and was perfect for a wedding. The breakfast was really good, cooked to order. Would recommend staying here if you want a few quiet nights away. </DOC> Had a Travelzoo deal of dinner, bed and breakfast. Warm and efficient welcome. Room clean, lovely shower, fluffy towels. Not the most up to date but everything you need for a short break. Lovely conservatory overlooking the countryside and golf course. Lovely evening meal. In short we found it hard to find fault. Beautiful location - idea for walking, cultural visits etc. </DOC> Visited on a very hot summer day for afternoon tea.. Inside was boiling hot, outside was a bit cooler, but only one umbrella was available and that was taken. We decided to eat inside rather than burn. Firstly the good bits: The price was very good value and the scones were freshly baked, tea & coffee was quite good, though we were not offered any variations & I forgot to ask. The staff were very helpful. Now the less good: the sandwiches were dry (bread left out?) and some of the crusts were still on. The cakes were very ordinary. In all, not bad given the price, but I would have preferred better quality and paid a bit more. </DOC> Stayed in a large group. Very comfortable hotel. Easy to find. More than adequate parking. Front of house and catering was excellent and we stayed in a four poster room overlooking a lovely view. Other friends stayed in cheaper rooms which they unfortunately termed 'Cell Block H'. Even in our really nice room we were disappointed that the small complementary water bottles were not replaced daily and I am glad we bought our own shampoos. The main problem was the broadband which went in and out like a fiddler's elbow and when it was in it was low powered. The only good point was that it was free. </DOC> We booked the Cricklade House Hotel for a Christmas Lunch gathering with a gang of friends. Sandra, the Events Organiser, was very helpful throughout. We had the Court Room to ourselves, which was ideal for a large group. The service was very efficient and and worked very well, particularly considering that there was another large party in another room. The food was good, tasty and wholesome. My only issues were that the Cranberry sauce wasn’t served and the mini Christmas puddings were clearly ‘catering desserts’ and disappointing. Overall, very good. Thank you. </DOC> This hotel reminded me of one I worked at for a season in 1978; some aspects were good, some were not. Ideally I would give 3.5 out of 5 as I'm not sure the overall experience was 'very good', the interpretation of four out of five. Our room really looked tired, particularly the bathroom. On the other hand, the one evening that we ate in the restaurant, the food was good. In fact, that reminds me of something else that stood out: the number of staff. I wonder how many 'full time equivalent' staff are employed. All were pleasant, some more so than others..."
37,"Great hotel, lovely comfortable room and a great dinner in the conservatory. The new owners seem finally to have the hotel under control and are moving it forward. For a long time after they acquired this lovely old place it looked like it was going backwards. I'd definitely put this hotel back on my list of places to stay when in Swindon. </DOC> The only thing that was wrong the service on 2 day was not as good as first day our breakfast was late coming and the sat evening meal was late they could not seem to cope with the amount of people that was there Hotel itself clean & tidy. </DOC> Lovely rural location with easy access from M4. Good Service, and very good food . We stayed in main house with balcony room(£10 extra) which was overlooking golf course ,clean and comfortable. On Travelzoo deal which was very good value. </DOC> We had our wedding reception here in the 90's and revisited for our anniversary. We couldn't fault anything about our visit. The room was clean and spacious( we had a four poster room in the main building ). All of the members of staff that we spoke to were very polite and helpful and the lunch, dinner and breakfast were all well presented and very good. We used the pool etc and this was clean and warm. A fantastic visit and one which we will not leave another 20+ years to repeat!! </DOC> Another Travelzoo deal. Stayed 2 nights with dinner on the 1st night. Room 46 in the main building. Room was reasonable large, very quiet with a view of tennis court & countryside.Everything worked but the wifi was slow - took ages to download my newspaper. Food was excellent & staff welcoming & attentive. But I like others would query why a fruit juice is extra for somebody on a Travelzoo deal. Breakfast was a good platefull fresly cooked & an extra pot of coffee was no problem. Happily stay again </DOC> The family had Christmas lunch here yesterday and, at a cost of £75 per head, thought it would be a special meal. Not so. The welcome drink was appreciated, and the parsnip soup was fine, but the main course was poor. The turkey and beef options were small; no separate dish of vegetables but instead 2-3 sprouts, 2 small stringy carrots and parsnips accompanying 2 little roast potatoes on each plate. My beef (fatty) was covered by a large but inedible Yorkshire pudding that must have been cooked sometime earlier: it was like cardboard. The pudding was fine, although again not large, but by then our opinions were formed. A lovely location and the staff were friendly and worked hard but we won't try this again. </DOC> We stayed at Cricklade House for 2 nights on a travelzoo deal in order to see our daughter in law wingwalking at a nearby airport, however the wingwalking was cancelled but not to worry our visit to the Cricklade hotel more than compensated for the dissapointment as the food and the staff were great and we had a thoroughly enjoyable .stay. </DOC> Lovely country house, great service, nice food, and very cheap. What more could you want? All this in an area without decent hotels. Well worth a few minutes drive off the M4. They also have strong Free WiFi. I will certainly be back"
38,"I recently organised a weekend group booking for a Vintage Car Club. The venue was excellent, and the staff really excelled themselves. Yes, they had a lot of very young waiting staff on duty but no worse than most other venues and actually very well trained. The food was mostly very good, apart from some very hard vegetables (undercooked) on one evening. Breakfasts was really good with some very nice sausages on the menu. The bedrooms were good, and the beds were comfortable. </DOC> We stayed here on a Saturday evening on our way to the Welsh Borders. We just wanted a comfortable hotel room and a nice dinner. At Cricklade House we certainly got that in spades. The reception staff were efficient and friendly as were the bar and restaurant staff. We especially appreciated the bar menu and drinks and breakfast was also very enjoyable. All in all a very happy stopover. </DOC> We arranged a party weekend for arounfd 70 people for the end of November 2014. The bespoke staff we liaised with were marvelous helped us every step of the way. General Manager assisted us through the weekend and was very courteous and helpfull. All staff were friendly and helpful We enjoyed all aspects of the weekend although there could have been air conditioning in the ballroom on the Saturday evening. We will definately return for a weekend to be spoilt by the lovely food and hospitality </DOC> I was really pleased with choosing this place. Service was fast and friendly, the room was nice and well laid out. Water was very hot. Breakfast was excellent value. I had a bar meal inthe evening and this was tasy and well cooked. A great choice on the menu too. The setting is on a golf course and is quiet with good views. Plenty of parking, free wifi, and a beer in the conservatory on the comfy sofas is a great way to end a long drive. Can't fault my stay! </DOC> We managed to get a very cheap deal for bed, breakfast and evening meal for 2 nights and were really happy with our room and bathroom. The breakfast was fine and the evening meal was really good. We paid £89.00 per couple for b & b plus meal. Exceptional value and I would happily have paid more. There is a golf course and a spa but we were visiting relatives so had little time but did visit Laycock which was fabulous. </DOC> Amazing family Sunday lunch came Sunday 12th- party of 10 we were in a side room. Such tasty, delicious Sunday lunch, attention to detail, staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Hotel has lovely views from conservatory over golf course. Definately go back soon- top marks!!! </DOC> This was a Travelzoo deal but we upgraded to the master suite for an extra £50 per night, wonderful. This was part of a celebration for my wife's special birthday and it was superb. The room was stunning, views were exceptional, hotel staff attentive and professional, service was impeccable, hotel clean and tidy. Drink prices were what you would expect, house champagne was £50 per bottle and house wine £19 per bottle. Superb break, would recommend this hotel, outstanding. </DOC> We had a lovely weekend at the Cricklade house. The staff at the hotel are really friendly and helpful. The views from the lounge are wonderful looking over Wiltshire. The pool and spa is good, clean and well worth a visit. There was a long wait (40mins) for breakfast on the Saturday morning, but the breakfasts was good. All in all joust what we were looking for when having a weekend in the country."
39,"Fantastic place , great view of beach and garden . You can sit inside or out in the garden area , which had a band playing today . You ordered at the bar as no table service (only to bring your food out when ready ) I had hunters chicken with chips , coleslaw and peas , which was lovely and my boyfriend had burger and chips , but he'd started eating it before I could take a photo so just a pic of mine sorry . The waiter who bought our food out was very polite . I would recommend this place as we did not have to wait long for food , this was good as we were starving and eating late at 2.30pm . </DOC> This hotel has an enviable location, a frontage that overlooks the sea and a beer garden that enjoys wonderful views. Only a small amount of rooms so a good idea to book early if you are set on dates. The cooked breakfast is a hearty affair, cooked fresh, no buffet style here and very good it was. The staff all appear eager to please especially Pippa, always carried out her duties with a smile, it makes everyone feel happier! We ate dinner both evenings at the hotel, a good choice and reasonably priced. The bed was very comfortable so all in all an enjoyable stay. A slight irritation, i think ALL rooms should offer a couple of free bottles of water each day, come on Greene King, that is not much to ask? </DOC> Popped in here with thirty friends for Sunday lunch. We gave them less than 24 hours warning and they stepped up to the plate with style. Great choice on menu with vegan and veggie options! Chose the veggie roast, freshly cooked , so it took 20 mins or so. Delicious. Very impressed that all the desserts were marked up if they were veggie! Thank you! Good value food, hard working staff, lovely spot. Will be back. </DOC> We stopped this place when we stopped in Beer. The location at Just the top of the beach and overlooking the beach and sea is an amazing view. There is indoor seating and outside seating on the Terrace garden. Service quick and friendly with food tasty just joy the best. Good value though. </DOC> Visited for an evening meal with friends. The bar we understaffed giving quite slow service. The food was delayed by 30 minutes but when it arrived was good, nice sized cod and chips. All in all a good evening but could do better </DOC> We stayed with my brother and his wife on a b&b basis.Friendly and helpful staff. Room recently refurbished and although small was extremely comfortable and very clean. Nice view over coast from our room (4). Evening meal was very good and breakfast more than adequate. If you're looking for a comfortable and friendly stay in a nice location definitely one for you. Don't be put off with the fact there is no car park as only ten minutes walk away there is a large public car park with (for winter rates) a minimal charge for 24 hours. </DOC> I visited this very large busy pub and sadly did not eat. The service was good and the beer was very good. It is set in a very good location in a lovely traditional fishing village. Parking can be a problem as it is tourist location. I would perhaps stay here on another visit. </DOC> A return visit to the Anchor Inn - just a one night stay this time. With all the rooms having sea views and all but one being en-suite, the hotel ticks all the boxes. However, the rooms are rather small, as are the en-suite facilities and the decorations are now rather tired compared to the two major budget hotel chains. I think it is time Greene King invested some of their expertise in updating this establishment. The breakfast is still good though!"
40,"As ever, a lovely, bust sea side, cliff top hotel/bar. Good service from the familiar bar staff. The hotel des well catering for lots of hungry visitors and provides good service and food. Well worth a visit - a nice feel here </DOC> The recent refurbishment & new menu has greatly improved this restaurant as previously it was very dated & a little rough around the edges. Good food at reasonable prices. New decor fits well with the surroundings. </DOC> We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Anchor. The room was spotlessly clean and the beds comfortable. The whole place was warm and welcoming. Beer is a delightful little village and we can't wait to go back. </DOC> We were made to feel very welcome during a recent stay - the staff were all very friendly; the room was clean and well furnished; and the breakfast, whilst slightly delayed, was hot and tasty. A lovely location close to the sea although there was no car park. An excellent place to stay midweek when it was £54 B&B. WiFi strong too. </DOC> We did not expect much, a pub in the prime spot in a tourist seaside resort £59 B&B, were we asking for trouble? We were very pleasantly surprised, the room whist small had a large bed, a decent shower, free WiFi and a view of the sea. We ate elsewhere in the evening but the breakfast was first rate, good choice of fruit/cereal eggs Benedict which were great and kippers which were also good. So not a memorable hotel but one which does everything it should although I expect parking would be an issue in summer. </DOC> We stayed here after a busy 3 days at a family wedding at nearby Huntsham Court. It was the ideal place to unwind as the hotel is located on a very quiet road overlooking the sea. Our room was comfortable, not huge, but a nice warm place to relax. The food was very good, reasonably priced, and the staff, particularly Aisha were polite and attentive. </DOC> Even on a wet cold January afternoon, the village of Beer holds a special charm. Calling into Tha Anchor for a late lunch completed the visit. A warm and comfortable recently refurbished lounge, with the best fish finger ( real home made fish fingers- not out of the freezer ) sandwich, served speedily with tasty accompaniments, wonderful. </DOC> Stayed at the Anchor last week, we had the same room as the last time, overlooking the sea, just love it. The beds are the best I haven't slept as well in ages. We had dinner in the pub, excellent food, and the breakfast was great. The village of Beer is a great little place, I bought fresh crab meat at the fish shop a stones throw away, fabulous. Highly recommend this place."
41,"Great sea views here from our clean and comfortable room. Good reception and particularly nice hostess at breakfast. The bar and dining area is warm and comfy and service here too was good. The menu is a bit underwhelming and the chicken dish I had was fairly tasteless but my wife's fish and chips were quite good. Could be a for star place if the food was more locally inspired and less formulaic. </DOC> Travelled to Beer today arrived at lunch time. Decided to have lunch in the Anchor Inn. Found a table easily which was great, viewed the extensive menu, then ordered drinks and the meal. Drinks arrived very quickly with the meal arriving very shortly after which was great. Lovely and hot, really tasty. Staff very cheery and organised. Beer is a lovely village to visit and the views from their beer garden are excellent. </DOC> We are fast bevoming regular stayers here in Beer. The room was comfortable and recently re decorated the staff were friendly and helpful. The ordering system is to our minds simple and straightforward you can either eat inthe bar or the restaurant. The breakfasts are very filling and kept us going until supper time. The evening food offers a good fishy selection for all tastes </DOC> This Pub/Hotel is located at the lower end of Beer High Street, right by the harbour. It is a really lovely location, and just a very short stroll down the hill to the water's edge. The hotel is clean and smart and the rooms are comfortable. Most, if not all, rooms have a sea view. The bathrooms are modern and clean, and plenty of fluffy white towels are provided. Tea and coffee facilities are provided in the room and a good wi-fi signal is available free of charge. The pub and restaurant has several seating areas, and has a pleasant 'local pub' atmosphere. The staff were all friendly and helpful. Beer is a very busy village in summer, but out of season is a very pleasant place to visit, with some lovely coastal walks right on the doorstep. </DOC> Been tarted up since I was here ... modernised but a bit of a much of a muchness like most modern bistro pubs ... staff efficient, fish and chips ok. Great location and for the summer has a good beer garden with lovely bay view. </DOC> We stayed in the Anchor Inn, Beer over the Easter period and had a really great time. The hosts, Mr and Mrs Hills (Phil and Jan) are so professional, polite, helpful and friendly and it filters down to all the staff. We have stayed here several times and it just gets better. The fresh fish, cod, hake and John Dory were meals to die for and there is an amazing choice for breakfast. The room we had was clean, bright and had a lovely sea view. We look forward to an extended stay in the summer. A superb inn. Well done. </DOC> A really lovely inn. Phil and Jan the hosts and their staff are so professional and friendly they do make you most welcome and relaxed. Myself and my partner have stayed here several times and we keep going back for more. Food is excellent, the rooms are so comfortable. This place really is a little bit of heaven in glorious Devon. Christmas here is like being at home. And in the summer it is a place to die for. </DOC> Chain-owned pub with a good location overlooking the harbour. Room small but clean and with all necessary facilities. Unexciting breakfast. Staff friendly enough and capable, but hard-worked and they lack the personal touch."
42,"We stayed at this hotel because of the wonderful reviews on this site. It more than met our needs. We had a rate of $99 per night including breakfast each morning. Also, there was no charge for parking! The hotel was spotless. The bed was very comfortable. The breakfast was good. We were not going into DC from this location but we did notice the Metro stop right across the street from the hotel so this could be an option for DC visitors. We were overall very pleased with our stay and would consider this hotel next time we are in the area. </DOC> Overall, I was impressed with this hotel for a recent business trip. Looks very new and updated. Very close to a metro station as well. Very friendly and courteous checkin and check out. Room was good sized with free internet, and a little balcony. A relaxing place after a day of work. The issues I had were minor ones. Printer (for boarding passes) was out of ink. I reported this, but no immediate fix available. Good luck using the 1970s microwave in the market place. It is funny in such a renovated and new looking lobby, that dinosaur can still be unearthed. Awkward location and difficult to use to heat food. Overall, I would stay here again for business travel, without reservation. </DOC> I think this is one of my excellent hotel experiences, the hotel is near to metro and a lot of restaurants. The check in was fast, the lobby was awesome. The room was great, well kept and looks new. The pool was great. The bistro restaurant was nice, the nearby Jefferson park deserves a visit. I would like to thank everybody works there, you are excellent. I can't wait for my next visit. </DOC> This is a very clean and newer hotel. They are located next to the Dunn Loring metro (Orange line) and is an easy commute into DC. Stayed in room 924 which overlooks the front of the property and apartment building and is the farthest corner from the road. Stayed here for a holiday party nearby. </DOC> We stayed here last year in December, then in August stayed elsewhere. We decided to come back here because the rooms were nice and quiet. Pros: rooms are spacious enough, the bed and cots are comfortable, the service is good, the towels are nice and large, they promptly fixed things that were broken. Cons: the sofabed was so uncomfortable that my 13-yr old said it was the worst bed she'd ever slept on (but they got her a cot instead), the gym is tiny and poorly-equipped, the pool is tiny. </DOC> Spent 2 nights on a business trip-parking garage underneath, quick & polite check in, clean room. Peculiar room arrangement as TV was at left side of bed, and I was straining my neck to watch TV while in bed, although the fold-out sofa bed faced the TV directly. Perhaps I just had a strange room. Small bistro in the lobby with Starbucks coffee & tea, but nothing is free, except use of the Wi-Fi and a spot to check in for flights and print boarding passes. Nothing special about this place, but it is fairly bright and cheery with a recent face-lift. I thought the room rates were pricey, hence rated only 2 stars for value. </DOC> Usually always stay at a Marriott!! This was not one of our favorites!! Big but not friendly and did not like the business center!! Room was good but just not one of our favorites and not easy to get around at this location!!! </DOC> Love to stay at the Courtyard by Marriott Dunn Loring Fairfax when we are in the DC area. The hotel is conveniently located next to the Dunn Loring metro station (orange line) and within 20 minutes you are in the heart of DC. You can walk from the hotel to several restaurants or the new Mosaic Place. Staff at the front desk is friendly and helpful. Rooms are very nice, very clean and good size. Bathroom also nice size, good light."
43,"No complaints at this hotel. In fact, I've stayed here multiple times, that is when this hotel is available. It's located in Dunn Loring/Merrifield and is across the street from Dunn Loring Metro station. Parking isn't a problem, in ground garage, just when you're in the garage, you've got no cell phone coverage. Your typical Courtyard Marriott bathroom & room decor. I would definitely come back to stay at this hotel. </DOC> This hotel was clean and comfortable with good free wireless internet. The lobby area was surprisingly trendy, and there was an outdoor lounge area (though it was too cold to spent much time there). This hotel was conveniently away from the traffic of Tyson's Corner....but still rather noisy thanks to the construction across the street in the parking lot for the Metro station. Hopefully the construction will finish soon. </DOC> Chose this hotel based on great reviews here on Tripadvisor and can say that I was not disappointed! The Courtyard by Marriott is located in the suburb of Dunn Loring directly next to the Dunn Loring Orange Line Metro stop, it's an easy trip to DC as well as everything in Northern Virginia. I really cannot say enough positive things about this particular Courtyard. Rooms are immaculate, very comfortable, and feature a nice mini fridge with microwave. Bed was fantastic and bathrooms are very spacious. Slight problem with tv reception that was quickly resolved. Hotel common areas and grounds also impeccable! Great weekend rates that are a real bargain over staying in hotels in Downtown DC. I highly recommend and will definitely stay here again! Great job Dunn Loring Courtyard! </DOC> Staying at this Courtyard for the first time this week. It is a nice and modern hotel with lots of amenities. Free wifi and free secure parking. The hotel is only one block from the metro so it is very convenient to public transportation. It is also located close to a lot of restaurants and other businesses. Recommended and would stay again. </DOC> I could not find anything negative to say about this Hotel. The easy walk to the metro was the selling point for us but there is so much more. The room was clean and comfortable, The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. We were extremely pleased by the price. The surrounding area was so nice to walk around and we found some very nice restaurants to enjoy a meal. Thank you to the management and staff, you will be seeing us again. </DOC> Stayed at this Courtyard when visiting Washington DC. This is a great choice to stay at if you are visiting DC for a couple of reasons. 1- The usual super clean and sleek hotel backed my Marriott (No need to explain ) 2- literally 2 blocks away from Dunn Loring Metro station which has the Orange Line that takes you to DC. 3- Also 2 blocks away from a huge supermarket Harris Teeter which has all groceries and even cooked food too! 4- There are also a couple of restaurants, Starbucks and stores all within a walking distance. We parked our car in the parking garage for the duration of our stay and decided to go to DC by Metro to save the hassle of driving, save time of traffic and save money instead of looking for parking in DC which is very hard to find and if you do it is expensive too. All in all this hotel is a major Win!!!!! </DOC> Stayed two nights here on family vacation. Front desk was friendly, helpful and efficient. There is free parking outside the building and in and underground location. There is free high speed internet in the rooms and there are free computers in the lobby area for printing boarding passes. Our rooms which seemed to be on a recently remodeled floor were were nicely furnished and very clean. The LCD television was a good size and had a good selection of channels. There was a good desk to work from and plenty of outlets for charging portable electronics. The hotel location is close to the Dunn Loring Metro and close by car to destinations in Tysons Corner, Fairfax and Vienna. </DOC> After a long trip from Europe I was met with a very warm and welcoming person at the front desk, they saw I was a walking zombie very quickly and gave me a quick overview of what was in the hotel and what facilities were available. The room was comfortable and did the job. No complaints at all."
44,"For the money, this Courtyard is excellent. For less than $100/night, we had a clean and comfortable room. The facility was well managed, and the front desk staff was attentive and friendly. We did not try the pool or the bistro, but they were available. WiFi worked well. There are a several restaurants within walking distance, and the train into DC is two blocks away. There is no complimentary breakfast, but there is a mini-fridge in the room, so we brought breakfast with us. Parking is underground (that's nice), but our car top carrier didn't fit, so we used a special area above ground. Not quite as convenient, but it worked. We would definately stay here again. </DOC> free parking is very good -- choice between garage and peripheral. desk staff responsive. check-in took literally less than 2 minutes, including the wait. restaurant was ok. no free breakfast. clean throughout. lobby useful for informal discussions over laptops. rooms ok, although hidden refrigerator design was strange and the bed covering was more limited than usual. only observed defect in the room was a pushbutton switch that worked sometimes. office chair didn't rise high enough for comfortable use of laptop on table. bathrooms very well designed. location very convenient to the metro and far enough from d.c. that the traffic is not always insane. </DOC> Arrived around 9 on a weeknight and check in was very quick and the staff pleasant. Room and bathroom very clean and the bed was comfortable. Frig and coffee in the room which is always nice. No breakfast is included but they do have a nice bistro to get food which was nice as well. I checked in late and checked out early but found it a nice hotel and would certainly stay here again. </DOC> Had a Friday night stay in the DC area and needed to be close to a Metro stop. This is the perfect place. Got a great room rate (being a Friday night may have helped), but the hotel is located approximately one block from the Metro station. Friendly staff and quiet hotel. Will certainly stay here again if a similar situation arises. </DOC> Stayed here several times over the past few weeks and each time has been great. Nice new lobby, plenty of computers and such to use. Love having the newer cafe for breakfast or a Sbux coffee. Absolutely love the underground parking, especially now that winter is here. Room is nice and large and very recently remodeled. The staff is very friendly and always recognize my previous stays at the hotel. Overall a great choice near the 50 and 495 freeways and a short 2-3 miles drive to Tysons Corner. </DOC> Stayed for 3 nights over Labor Day weekend, with a Rewards Members rate of $71/nt. This rate did not include breakfast. The hotel had a nice lobby, free internet, great rooms with a comfortable bed and large bathroom with granite counter and shower seat. The underground parking was a great feature. Never used the metro, but it was just a block away. Tysons Corner mall was really nice, and included some great upscale restaurants and shops. Would definitely stay here again. </DOC> Clean room. Road noise was a little heavy if you face the metro station. I'd ask for a room that faces away from the Dunn Loring Station if you can. Breakfast was excellent and included in our room rate. Not many restaurants close by, but hop on subway and you're in downtown DC in about 25 minutes. </DOC> Stayed here on and off for years. Great location next to metro and a entire selection of restaurants within walking distance. The rate varies considerably through the year. Sometimes it is very affordable, for DC, sometimes it is over the top. Rooms have just been redone. Garage in basement is a little tight but about standard for area."
45,"Hasn't stayed here in years as the price is usually higher than the Marriott in Tyson area up the road. On the other hand it is walking distance to the metro stop and there are now about 15 restaurants of every type within walking distance as well. Everything was well executed and if You do have a car their parking lot is under the building very convenient and free the weekend we were there </DOC> We were in DC for a wedding plus a couple of days of being tourists. The hotel worked very well. It was a couple of blocks from a Metro stop, and there was free parking in a locked garage under the hotel. On the ninth floor we didn't hear too much noise from outside, and there was minimal interior noise. One small problem we had with the room was fixed quickly. It would have been nice to have had a hook in the bathroom. A good experience on the whole. </DOC> Stayed here for two weekend nights while visiting our son who attends school in DC. I chose this hotel for the reasonable rate of $99 which included breakfast and because we could walk to the Metro stop a block and a half away. It is about a 25 minute Metro ride into DC which is why, I suppose, the rate is so reasonable. The hotel also has free wifi and parking which were pluses. The room was comfortable, a standard Courtyard by Marriott room - no complaints. I also thought the included breakfast was very good. It doesn't seem that there is much around the hotel that you can walk to (shops, restaurants). Bottom line, if you're looking for an alternative to a pricey Washington hotel room and don't mind the longish Metro ride, this hotel certainly fits the bill. </DOC> The location of this property is excellent. It's just around the corner from metro and across the street from Harris Teeter. There are several restaurants within walking distance including Italian and bbq. Didn't get a chance to use the pool or hot tub. The staff is very friendly and took care of our every need. The only problem was the noisy climate control. It reminded us of old hotels that didn't have a thermostat but just high or low cool or hot. It clunked all night. If not for that this could have been 5 stars. Forgot to mention the free parking which is always a plus when staying in a large city. </DOC> This is one of the best hotels to stay at if sightseeing in the area. Metro is a block away and an easy ride in to DC, Arlington Cemetery, Pentagon memorial etc. The area around the hotel is built up since our last visit and now there is a Harris Teeter across the street and numerous restaurants/coffee shops with in walking distance. Rooms are large and quiet. Kids enjoyed the indoor pool. Lobby is nice with several TV's. Standard menu at the Bistro. Parking is free and covered. There is a work out room. </DOC> We stayed here for a family function in Vienna & although there was a nearer hotel the metro was very close for visits to shopping centres & Washington DC. The area appears to be very up & coming with more restaurants & apartments being built. The staff were very pleasant & welcoming & the room was quite comfortable. There was also quite a good selection for breakfast but food is only served during dining hours. However, there are 24 hour snack machines available. The only thing we could have done without was a faulty fire alarm very early in the morning but the staff refunded us the night's stay without any problems. </DOC> Stayed here on business. Accommodated my early check-in request, clean room and public areas, nice options for breakfast/dinner, and I loved the 1-block walk to the Metro. Took it from Reagan right to the hotel, and into the city for meetings there. Great value for a business stay!! </DOC> We recently stayed at this hotel over Father's Day weekend. The hotel is located next to a metro stop. For anyone wanting to visit the Washington D.C. area and not pay the rates in the city, this offers an affordable alternative. You can stay at the hotel and walk across the street to access the DC metro. The rooms are clean and very well kept. Free wireless internet is also included in your rate. The front desk was efficient and friendly."
46,"Highly recommended. This place is a very nice hotel. The lobby is expansive with plenty of seating, a breakfast nook area, and more. Breakfast is pay-as-you go. But you get what you pay for. There's a Starbucks concessionaire with light breakfast snacks in the breakfast nook area. The rooms are spacious and well appointed. Some come with balconies. There's an indoor pool and exercise room. Rooms are well insulated and quiet. Parking is underneath the building and provides plenty of space for guests. The location is close to Route 50 and Gallows road and smack dab in the middle of the 50/Merrifield/Gallows Road retro build of shops, high-rise buildings and stores. We loved staying here. We'll be back. </DOC> This facility is perfectly located for visiting an elderly relative in the next block. It is within walking distance of a shopping center and restaurants. However, the Bistro at this Courtyard is wonderful! I found our room to be spotless and spacious!! Highly recommend this Marriott if you find yourself in this area!!! We will be back!!!! </DOC> This is not a full service hotel and it is not meant to be. I have stayed here once or twice a year. What impresses me is the efficiency of the place. Check in works, check out works, the hotel rooms work, the dining area is effective and suited to business traveller needs. You carry your own bags in, but that's good. Everything gets done more quickly. There is a shopping and commercial area being built nearby. In a year or two when it's done the district will meet everyone's needs wihtout having to drive everywhere. </DOC> Stayed 5 nights at the hotel at it was very pleasant, the staff very friendly and always open to help. The rooms were very clean, the only recommendation will be to have security boXes at the room, they are only available at the reception. The place is just around the corner of a good supermarket (Harris teeter) I will recommend to buy snacks and water at the super as at the hotel are expensive. Highly recommended place just 10 minutes in uber from Tyson's Corner area. </DOC> Stayed here for 2 night business trip. Hotel has underground garage that is complementary. Room was the usual for the Courtyard brand although this was fresher and cleaner than most. Great housekeeping service that was very attentive. Front desk staff are helpful. Only challenge was the long line to purchase breakfast food. </DOC> Outstanding location very near Metro stop, grocery store, neighborhood branches of various chain restaurants and services. Very clean property with welcoming staff, free parking, functional and attractive lobby. Outstandingly comfortable and clean bed. Indoor pool w/lifeguard (and serious rules about showering beforehand, staying close to kids, etc.--but not in an unpleasant way). Rooms smallish, but the Courtyard chain isn't designed to be a luxury resort. Recommended by friends, and we see why. </DOC> Just finished a week long trip to the DC area. Though I now live in NYC (used to be a few minutes from this hotel), I'm down in the area regularly. Sometimes, when the rate is right, I'd rather stay at a hotel than my parents house or a friend's house. This weekend was my third stay at this hotel - it's a great property, just steps to the Metro, minutes to Tyson's Corner,right near 495 & 66 - so a perfect location. Great staff, never have an issue when I stay here. Housekeeping always keeps the rooms spotless and it's a great hotel. </DOC> Stayed here one night and the location was sufficient as it was close to the location of my meeting. The hotel has been updated and there was nothing special to speak of. I was greeted as a Gold member which I appreciated as some Marriott properties won't give me that recognition. The breakfast was included in my stay and the food was good. I would stay at again if I had another meeting to attend at this location."
47,"You regular readers of my reviews (I still crack me up) by now have figured out I am a Marriott guy. I travel quite a bit for business and can count on the Courtyards to always be very clean, well maintained, and well suited for me to stay productive. This one is no different. Now that some road construction is finished nearby, this property is very convenient to anything in the area. If like me you try to take the subways when possible, the Metro station is right across the street. This would be a good place to stay for DC sightseeing - if you haven't been to DC before, you DO want to take the Metro in and out, not drive. Very big lobby, extra computers in the business center, attentive staff. Enjoy! </DOC> A nice hotel that is very convenient to the Metro. Large rooms that are spotless. The staff is friendly and efficient. Very good rates and free parking. My only complaint is that they have turned their full service restaurant into a counter service operation...not so exciting. Look here if you want to save a few bucks while visiting DC. </DOC> Great location just 4 minute walk to the Metro Orange Line. Staff was friendly and nice clean hotel. Area is pretty nice with lots of restaurants. I used the metro to sight see in DC and go to Arlington Cemetery. Also has easy access to Dulles access road to get to Dulles if needed. Overall, good location. Free parking also. </DOC> Nice looking rooms and bathrooms. You can print your plane ticket at a computer. The deck at the room is huge. Nice lobby. Close to subway, grocery store, restaurants and stores. They have a shower with a seat and bars, but you have to step over the tub to get in. </DOC> Successfully stayed and want to compliment the friendly staff and its great location. Staff is always welcoming and helpful. Location is a block to the Metro and going the opposite direction a block to many restaurants. A further walk/short drive up to many restaurants, theater and a target. Pool is shared with a children's swim lesson company. Suggest a room toward the back to avoid street noise. </DOC> Dunn Loring isn't the sexiest neighborhood in the greater DC area so I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. It is modern and spotless with all the small things that make a huge difference for business travel - outlets in the lamps, mini-fridge, fast and reliable wi-fi, a kitchen/bar area with hot meals at weird hours, and free parking below the hotel. I can't tell you how rare it is to find free and convenient parking in the DC area. Also you are steps from the Dunn Loring Metro stop, and Target plus every possible eatery is within a 5 minute drive or walking distance. Everything was clean and the staff were very nice - an even rarer commodity in our nation's capitol. </DOC> My family recently stayed at the Courtyard for a family wedding and it could not have been more convenient. The hotel is in great shape and the service was solid. Free parking, free internet, free fitness center and all just steps from shops, good dining options and the Metro. We will definitely be back when we're visiting the DC suburbs. </DOC> This is my fourth time at the Courtyard Dunn Loring on Fairfax, VA. Every visit is excellent. The facility is well kept and the rooms are marvelous. The rooms have a good desk when you need to burn the midnight oil. There a secure garage underneath the hotel. The onsite cafe serve a very nice breakfast and Starbucks coffee. The staff is always very nice. The hotel has great access to all major highways."
48,"Wonderful hotel The whole staff was excellent, friendly, and VERY accomadating. Never lacked for anything. Everything you want a hotel room to be. Great bed, excellent water pressure, and clean rooms. The metro line to Washington DC is right across the street. It is on a main road, but 2 miles from the freeway so there is little traffic to contend with. There are resturants 1 mile south and 2 miles north of the hotel. </DOC> If you are going to No. Va. to see the sights in Washington DC, this is your hotel. It is a one block walking distance to the metro. Restaurants are an easy drive away. There is an Asian market nearby if you need to pick up snacks, beer, wine etc. The rooms are nice. Housekeeping does a fine job..There is free parking for your car. They have a nice outside sitting area. The only draw back was that there is no hot tub. There used to be one, but it has been removed. There is a lifeguard. </DOC> This is a beautiful modern hotel. It is an easy walk from the Dunn Loring Metro Station and the many office buildings in this general region. There is a resturant on the property, which is nice because there are few resturants within walking distance of the hotel. Room are modern and very clean. Staff is helpful. The only downside is the price but that is to be expected for a place this nice and so close to the Metro. A refridgerator and a large flat screen TV was in my room. I will admit I do prefer the Homewood Suites about a half mile south of here. That place has a free breakfast and dinner (Monday to Thursday) and the rooms are apartment-style suites. Its a better place in my view, but this Marriott is still wonderful. 5 star vote in my book. </DOC> The main reason that I chose this hotel was due to its convenience next to the Dunn Loring Metro station and short drive to Tysons Corner. I was redeeming Marriott Rewards certificates for a two-night stay for my family to visit the DC area. The parking garage is very convenient with easy in-and-out access. This was fantastic as the weather was very rainy. The common areas of the hotel were clean and spacious with the standard Courtyard Bistro cuisine which is nice if you are in a bind. If you have car access, I would suggest a quick drive to Tysons Corner for numerous fine dining options. There is a Dunkin Donuts within walking distance within the new apartment complexes being built next to the hotel. The room had the standard, yet updated decor and comfort. The room was very clean. </DOC> I had work in DC, but intended to see sights also in DC and VA suburbs (Wolf Trap concert and Udvar-Hazy Air and Space museum -- the latter is a must-see, by the way). Being across the street from Metro in a hotel with free parking seemed the way to go. The hotel was a model Courtyard -- friendly and helpful staff, impeccably clean, etc. Only problem was that the station across the street was closed for the weekend for testing of new systems, so the options were a shuttle bus or drive to a closer-in station (I chose to drive). The AC problems described in other reviews seem to be fixed -- high 90s and no discomfort in the hallways or common areas. </DOC> Another good experience from the Courtyard. Excellent room, both in size and cleanliness. Two beds, always odd for an Englishman, and both provided an excellent nights sleep. Good work area, clean bathroom. This chain always seems to maintain a consistent standard. </DOC> Stayed here one night in business. Staff super friendly with fast check in. Comfortable lobby and dining area. Good restaurants nearby. Get a higher room and inner courtyard view to avoid traffic noise. Would defiantly stay again ! </DOC> My brother booked the Courtyard by Marriott Dunn Loring Fairfax for the out of town family and friends attending his daughter's Northern Virginia wedding. The weekend rate was not only a fraction of the weekday business rate but included a quite decent breakfast. The rooms and styling felt fresh and new. Plus there was free internet everywhere. The cool free underground parking kept the cars from becoming ovens in the sweltering DC heat. Plus we took advantage of the Metro post wedding as the starting point to visit not only the DC museums but our mother, who lives in Bethesda, MD. In the short, from the Dunn Loring, Northern, Virginia Metro, you have easy access to DC, Maryland, and Northern Virginia environs. If my brother or mother planned another party (such as an anniversary, birthday, or wedding) we'd look forward to staying here again!"
49,"Clean. Comfortable. Competent staff. 21st century decoration scheme. Free coffee in lobby. Free parking. Easy to get to from Rt.66 or 495. 200 yards from Dunn Loring metro. No hair dryers. Cheap on weekends. This is my new spending-the-weekend-in-DC hotel. </DOC> Decnet place to stay, nothing out of the ordinary. Not within walking distance of anything other than the Metro. Room was clean but heating unit was pretty loud, no way to watch TV without cranking the volume up so loud that your neighbors could hear it. Hallways had a pretty stale smell but not the rooms. fitness center pretty weak - 2 treadmills, stationary bike, and an elliptical. </DOC> This was our second stay here and the sequel was just as good as the first time. The deciding factor was the location it is within 2 blocks of the Washington Metro which make travel to the city a breeze. The motel is nicely appointed with large very clean rooms. The staff are friendly and helpful. Dinner at the bistro was good for a snack after a long day of touring. If we return to Washington this will be where we stay. </DOC> Before we booked this hotel, we did the necessary research to determine what hotels were near the DC Metro stations. We used trip advisor to review the various hotels and opted for this hotel. It did not disappoint. The location was one block from the Metro station, plenty of free parking, clean, comfortable, and quiet rooms. The weekend prices were very reasonable--a great value. Would definitely stay here again if in the DC area. </DOC> The idea of leaving towels you wish to reuse sounds good on paper but does not work when things are let after a room check out. Upon arrival I went to use a hand towel and it had fresh (not stains) lipstick marks - YUK! Then I was going to use some of the handlotion and it was only 1/4 full and had dried lotion on the top. I was now beyond wondering what else had been used...not good! The room looked clean and the staff was very nice and helpful. The location was just across the street from the metro stop parking area and just a short half block walk to the orange line of the metro. There are plenty of shops and restaurants if you choose to eat in the burbs. There is even a nice cafe and convenience store in the hotel with affordable prices. Parking is free. </DOC> This is one of the nicer Marriott Courtyard hotels that I have stayed in. The beds are upgraded (more comfortable) over what I typically have experienced in most Courtyard hotels. The rooms are quiet (good insulation from outside noices) and clean. Staff are friendly and helpful, and the lounge area is nice - open with good lighting. I was easily able to hold a business prep meeting in the afternoon in the lounge They also have a nice sized exercise room with good equipment, and on-site garage parking available. Good location for easy access to nearby highways. You can't go wrong if you stay here. </DOC> Right on the Metro line. Free hotel parking (in a garage)....need I say more? OK, I will. The property is outstanding. Staff went above/beyond. Free newspapersssss (USA Today, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post)....not just one....but three. Room was in like-new condition. </DOC> Enjoyed my stay here, good parking, friendly staff. Felt a bit pricey, but guess that is what you get in that area. Bed comfort was only OK, but no major complaints overall. Would stay here again. Silver City diner nearby was good. LOTS of road construction in area right now though."
50,"We were pleasantly surprised at this Hotel, Great location, across the road from a Tram line, walking distance to a whole range of things like the Beach, Albert Pk restaurants, South Melbourne Markets and More, some great places to eat right outside the Hotel and then gourmet food in the hotel dining room or if you like it simple great bar food. Ambiance is great with the feeling of stepping back in time to another era, fire places in several locations is sensational. The rooms are up to the minute with all modern equipment even iPod docking station and great showers. The only complaints was that the rooms are very small and if you get the wrong one can be noisy, Ask for a quiet larger room. </DOC> Overnight stay for a Swan's AFL match in Melbourne. Saw this hotel in a write up we read in a magazine in a medical waiting room. Easy to get to on the 96 tram, from Southern Cross Station, tram stop directly over the road from the hotel. Hotel room very small, but very well appointed. Great little bathroom. Comfy bed. After the match, bought drinks from the hotel bar, and took them to a lovely quiet lounge with a fire glowing. Breakfast was very tasty and ample food to eat. Went for a walk in the morning, down to the beach. Unbelievable amount of restaurants in the street alongside the hotel. Would love to return to enjoy them. Found the staff really friendly, and very helpful. </DOC> We chose this hotel because it was close to the Ferry Terminal. We were pleasantly surprised to find it excellent accommodation. Check in was a breeze and the people very friendly and helpful. The rooms were super clean and well laid out. Modern bathroom with walk in shower and nice toiletries. The restaurant was upmarket and very popular; food was excellent. We used the express check-out which was very handy as we left very early. Altogether it was excellent. A couple of minor things to note. There's no on-site parking (just in the street) and no lift to the upper floors. </DOC> This hotel is one of the standouts of all the hotels I have stayed at so far in Melbourne over the last 5 weeks (2 weeks and more hotels to go). Granted I was upgraded to the King Apartment but walking into it I went, Wow!! The hotel reminded me of The Windsor but this one has been refurbished very well. I ate a bar meal in the downstairs bar and with it being a Friday night the bar had a really good buzzy vibe to it. The staff rate a special mention, as I am sure most of you have partaken of the platitudes given out freely by staff as you pass through their lives, Enjoy your stay etc. I felt at this hotel that the friendliness, professionalism and service delivered was actually backed up with sincerity. This was demonstrated throughout the hotel. </DOC> We recently had a reason to go to Melbourne and decided to stay at The Middle Park Hotel again We were no disappointed, Even better the second time around. We had room 211 which was much larger than our lat room and also much quieter. A bonus was a full bath, the only negative it was on the second floor and no lift. Staff, food, Bar, and pub counter meals were all superb. The only complaint was the poor lighting in the bathroom. We took the tram into the city from right out front, only 10 mins and a pleasant ride. Great little village out front of the hotel with a variety of restaurants to choose from. Tapas bar, Indian, Italian, Coffee shops and tons of atmosphere. </DOC> I have stayed here now a few times for business when in Melbourne. The rooms are always clean and staff are friendly. The food in the bar area is pretty good, however, for a nice meal spoil yourself in the restaurant. Top quality food, no complaints here. </DOC> We have stayed here for business on several occasions, but this was the first time in 6 months. Since our last stay, the mini bar in the room has been removed, and breakfast is now served in house instead of the cafe across the road. Not to mention the food in the restaurant has gone downhill, my steak was only average and the sides were not even close to what the waiter stated. Still a convenient place to stay, but prefer the old Middle Park hotel. </DOC> I have been staying here for years. Its comfortable, convenient, great value for money, quiet, clean and perfectly located opposite the 96 tram that goes straight into the city in 4 stops. Everything you could possibly needs as a traveller is located in the same street and only metres away. I would have given 5 stars but its a little tired now and needs a some new carpet and painting. Despite this I will continue to stay here when I come to Melbourne for work or pleasure."
51,"Well, what a disappointment... this is a pub with rooms upstairs, period. We had the King apartment, which other than being big is no big deal. Strikingly, the interior deco is totally absent, nothing except furniture... and no bathrobe, no tissues, no slippers, no iPad dock, no Milk amenities as indicated. Overall the space is unique but it lacks character, like an blend Airbnb </DOC> Stayed in room 208. Despite double glazing, constant traffic and pedestrian noise kept me awake for hours. Size of the room was small and there was no desk. The shower door could only open inwards (when opened out, it would hit the toilet !). Although it is modernised and the staff are friendly, it is essentially pub accommodation and definitely not a place for a quiet stay. </DOC> Very disappointing visit. Not the friendly atmosphere I expected because of the closed booths. Good very overpriced for what you receive. Seemed to be. Lace where you needed to be one of the crowd and unwelcoming </DOC> I have been staying at this hotel for 3 years . I come to Melbourne 6 times a year for work and this is always my first choice of hotel . I could stay anywhere but I like the cost atmosphere , friendly service , yummy breakfasts , and comfortable rooms . The bar and restaurant are an added bonus plus the tram across the road and the village in the same street with all the gift shop , news agency , cafés and supermarket . I have recommend The MPH to so many people that this time there were 5 other guests I knew staying at the same time as me . It's the best kept boutique hotel secret in Melbourne </DOC> Very close to the CBD (4 km, tramline 96, 15 minutes) with such easy access to Melbourne , in an affluent and beautiful area suburb, this is one not to miss. Close to Melbourne’s best beach. Pub is very impressive! Very clean, simple and modern rooms in a beautiful building, this is a gem! Not expensive compared to the omnipresent and prohibited Melbourne prices... One of my favourite hotels conting 119 countries. </DOC> Location good for easy access to Albert Park, St Kilda and ferry to Tansmania. Also good access into South Melbourne areas. Food in bar is good and room we had was very good. Was a bit surprised that breakfast was not in the restaurant of the hotel but over the road at Victorian Wines, the good thing was breakfast was good but down side only a 15 dollar allowance so porridge and drink takes you over! Would have expected a normal hotel breakfast to be covered. </DOC> The rooms are above a functioning pub, so I was worried noise could be a problem, but only on night could I honestly say I found any noise intrusive, and it stopped by 11pm. Even the street noise from patrons smoking outside wasnt an issue. The rooms are comfortable and well presented, and big enough, the bed was ok. There is a small en-suite bathroom that was reasonably modern. There are plenty of places nearby to eat, or eat in the pub itself. Breakfast is provided but its simple but I found it ok for me. Right across Canterbury Rd is a light rail stop for the light rail to the city or to St Kilda. Middle Park and other beaches are within an easy walk. I found this hotel to be very suitable for my needs, and would consider it again. </DOC> Stayed here one night before a flight to Cairns. Nice room and comfortable bed, good shower. Victorian building having undergone a recent revamp. Bar is very popularandlots of locals use it after work for a drink and a bar meal. Restaurant is very good with a good selection of well cooked meals. Breakfast was included, but after the meal tyhe night before we opted for a light toast and jam with tea. Good staff andvery helpful with all queries. Would not hesitate to use again."
52,"The town itself is historic and well worth a visit and where better to stay than the Parador . It really is a stunning building that has been restored to the highest standards , lovely reception , public areas and rooms . Our room had lovely views of the surrounding countryside was spotless and had a state of the art bathroom . Shame though no ironing board or tea making facility - maybe some day in the future ? Staff were friendly and helpful by Paradore standards - smashing breakfast good place to stay . </DOC> We got a deal on the Parador on booking.com probably because it was empty in early June. If we'd been charged the regular price it would have lost a star. The room was fine with a minimal view (we were at the side). Sadly the cooked breakfast had been sitting under a lamp for some time and the eggs and bacon were cold and my coffee was burnt. They clearly the cook made up enough for the morning and left early. The rest of the breakfast was fine (cheese, meat, fruit, bread, etc). I had stomach cramps for the rest of the day, probably from the coffee but who can say. </DOC> I have stayed here on several occasions over the years and this hotel has always provided a good level of service. The room are generously proportioned and furnished to a high standard. Taking a room on a high floor is a good idea as you are afforded with a good view of the Aragon countryside. The restaurant offers some local dishes and a good comprehensive wine list. As a parador is is always worth returning. </DOC> We stayed here after 3 days in Pamplona at San Fermin, and it was a perfect getaway. The desk staff was pleasant and helpful. The room was not huge, but it was attractive and comfortable and had a great view. First class bathroom. The food in the restaurant was very good and it was easy to walk through the town, as long as you don't mind going uphlll. Highly recommended. </DOC> A lovely parador with the usual high quality rooms. In a fascinating village and with outstanding views. Staff professional and helpful. However I am starting to grow weary this year by the useless wifi I am finding in every parador I stay in. Something has changed to make this the third parador with poor connection. </DOC> Standard Parador on the outskirts of the town but close enough. Good parking - unsecured, but village location so should be safe. Rooms (standard) a bit on the small side but very large public areas including a fantastic terrace overlooking the surrounding area. Restaurant standard Parador fare, excellent desserts and reasonable breakfasts. The town is outstanding and the mosaics in the crypt of the romanesque church truely great. </DOC> Had a great overall experience! Staff was friendly and accommodating. The hotel is very nice and the rooms are excellent with the bathroom being very very good. Definitely a four star hotel. We ate tapas in the hotel bar and were quite satisfied. The town is absolutely charming without any tourist traps. I would stay there in a second. Comparable hotel in the states would be a minimum of 4 times as much! </DOC> The real reason for staying here is the setting in the beautiful medieval town. The parador itself wasn't quite up to the standard of some paradors, but it was still very good. I had a superior room, which was furnished nicely except for the very uncomfortable sofa. The room was almost too large; if I were to stay here again, I would likely opt for only a standard room. Everything was spotlessly clean. The buffet breakfast in the morning was excellent, in a large, airy breakfast room."
53,"As you know the parador chain you immediatly feel at home in this onr. Although it is one of the larger hotels in the chain quality and standards are maintained on a high level. Room was spacious and had wifi ( not the very best signal but ok ) breakfast was superb and the diner we had was delicious ad well. No buts at all ? Yes one, the tiled floors in the rooms, it becomes quite noisy when the upstairs neighbours start moving chairs around ( or walk on high heels for quite a long time) :-) </DOC> The town is the birthplace of king Ferdinand II of Aragon. The parador is an enjoyable hotel with a fantastic terrace where you can sit an enjoy the view or a good book. Rooms are very nice and clean. Service is very good. Breakfast is very good. Very good value for money. Do take time to take a walk around this beautiful little village. </DOC> Stayed on Friends of Paradores half board deal. Offered room upgrade on arrival - 45 Euros per night!! Needless to say, offer declined. Super location and wonderful building. However, in comparison to other Paradores, the little extras were missing - no bathrobes in the room and no nuts/nibbles served with drinks on the terrace. Food was OK but nothing to write home about. In summary - could do better. </DOC> My wife and I stayed one night at this Parador on our way to San Sebastian. We didn't do much research before booking but we were pleased with the location and the view at this Parador. The city is located around 600 meter in the mountains and the view of the surrounding is quite stunning. Our standard room was well furnished but small but we had a great view of the mountain. The terasse at the restaurant offered a stunning view of the surroundings and this is where we spent most of our time. The food was good but as with other Parador the wine selection is limited. Breakfast buffer was good as well. Overall we had a good time in Sos del Rey Catolico and this parador offered a great night of sleep and a great location. </DOC> We noticed the difference over the days we stayed. Sos is a unique destination because of its history and character, so the weekend was bustling whereas Monday was tranquil, both in the town and in the restaurant! With so many people, staff were pushed. They were still charming and good humoured for all that! The food was good, though I would not put it at the top of my Parador list for that. However, the location is fabulous with stupendous views across Aragon - a drink on the bar terrace is a treat for the eyes. Sos is a place to marvel at its long, !ong history, not to shop! We enjoyed it here. </DOC> I've stayed here before so knew the hotel & village. Both lovely. Sad to say the food provided at dinner was rather poor for the price and not up to the standard I'd expect. Breakfast however was excellent. The views are though fantastic, just find somewhere else for dinner I'd suggest </DOC> This Parador is beautifully located with panoramic views of the surrounding countryside.The public areas of the hotel are pleasant but our room was very small and could have been cleaner and the air conditioning is set at 26 degrees which for us was not cool enough.The breakfast was very good but the evening meal was awfull which is totally typical of Paradors.Flies in the bedroom were not at all welcome we left with bites everywhere.Staff were not at all friendly or helpful. </DOC> This Parador is a pleasant mix of old an new construction. Our room was in the old part with dodgy air conditioning and rickety blinds and shutters but high ceilings and loads of character. The dining room is on the top floor and has great views if block concrete construction. The local cuisine was excellent but not to all our party's taste. Paradors have lot of local history and artefacts and SOS is no exception. Very very hot at 35 c so the weak aircon was our only issue. No swimming pool but there's a fair municipal one five minute's drive away."
54,"Stunning property just outside the walls of the village with spacious, comfortable and well appointed room. Upgraded to room with a view which was lovely and only fault was inability to adjust the air conditioning down to a comfortable level for us and should have phoned the helpful reception but didn't. Walked around the village in the afternoon with houses being restored in the narrow streets and sat at the bar in the small square for a coffee. We had the set meal in the restaurant on the evening which was ok if a bit salty for our tastes (main course) but the breakfast was very good, nice for hot and cold choices. Coffee not the best we had had throughout Spain but ok. </DOC> We were on an itinerary to explore NE Spain--Catalonia and the Basque region. The others in our group had not stayed at a parador before the trip, so we chose this one as a convenient spot between Barcelona and San Sebastian. It turned out to be a restful and pleasurable stop in the village of Sos del Rey. The hotel is capacious and well appointed, the food is very good and the staff are well trained, friendly and helpful. We were driving and there was a garage at an additional cost. We were all four relaxed and well fed when we left. A word of caution about the town--the grades are steep and this is not a place for travelers with mobility problems. </DOC> Modern looking building but wih the usual Parador touches inside. There is a terrace on the fourth floor overlooking countryside and the sunset. The restaurant is also on this floor. It is quite a steep climb up to the village, which is practically devoid of tourist tat for a change. Staff thin on the ground as usual but pleasant enough. The food was quite good, despite the overpriced Parador menu in the region of E35. </DOC> Stayed there in mid June and found the hotel to be very good with a nice room with great view, comfy bed etc. Food was also good and the town itself was completely dead apart from one or two bar / restaurants. I think they must all be holiday lets or something because we only saw one or two locals scurrying around! Compared to the Parador we stayed at in Viehla it was the better of the two. </DOC> We enjoyed our two night stay in a superior room with a balcony which had a lovely view over the valley. We enjoyed watching the lightning during a major thunderstorm, and then the fog and mist rolling on the second morning. The rooms was comfortable, nice sized bathroom and good hot water although the shower was over the bath which can be difficult if you have any mobility issues. As in all Parador we have stayed in, very nice linens and bath sheets. We are members of the Amigos program which is free to join and includes better rates and a welcome drink. The outdoor balcony bar area is a fabulous space to enjoy an evening drink, or just to sit and relax and enjoy the views. There is plenty of parking on the road adjacent to the Parador. </DOC> Stayed 2 nights in May 2012. Beautiful situation, in restored hilltop village: perfect for evening strolling. Room, service, and facilities very good. Only slight disapointment was quality of main restaurant meal in evening - restaurant was not busy but meal took hours, and food was unexciting. We had regional menu (always do at Paradors) and maybe we were in the wrong region??? Would recommend check out some village restaurants before committing to hotel dinner. However, breakfast was excellent. </DOC> The rooms in this hotel are large and comfortable with some of the best air conditioning of any hotel we’ve stayed in. The hotel is in a beautiful location and there are lovely public areas and a fantastic bar with a terrace that overlooks the surrounding countryside. Dinner was excellent with great food and great service. On our first morning breakfast was poor with not much choice and lots of food items having run out and the only waitress slow to replace things or not replenish certain things at all. Breakfast was much better on the second morning which made up for the disappointment of the first day. </DOC> Stayed here for three nights on a trip around Aragón and Navarra. Great setting and wonderful views. Sitting on the terrace watching the sun go down and the vultures flying around was idyllic. Room was nice enough but the ones at the front with unrestricted views would be better. Ours was at the side and did have views to each side, but looked directly on to the old walls/rocks which meant people exploring the rocks could have looked in. Wonderful food in the restaurant. Pleasant staff. Well worth exploring the town: church, castle etc."
55,"It is a nice hotel. We stayed here during one of the conference. The property is a newer one. Restaurant food is good. Room is lovely. It is however far off from the airport but if the workplace is in East of Delhi, it is an ideal hotel. </DOC> This was my third stay in the Radisson group of hotels. Since the location was way out of the city, i was thinking there won't be the usual comforts of radisson. But i was in for a surprise. It was fantastic. Starting from front desk to house keeping wonderful service. Special mention of the chef excellent mouth watering dishes. Authentic spreads. Variety of cuisines. Not the run of the mill ones which is given when ever there us residential workshops. </DOC> wonderful food, pleasing ambience. prompt room service and all your needs are taken care of. breakfast menu was well spread and delicious. only issue was that spa was not on. pool water was neat and clean. requested for an upgrade and upgrade was given without any attitude. </DOC> I had a very comfortable stay here in August, 2013 on a business trip. It took me 2 hours from Delhi airport to reach here, but once inside I forgot all tiredness. Very lavish layout, comfortable and spacious room. I had the rajasthani delicacy at their restaurant which was awesome. The food is slightly pricey, but worth for its presentation, preparation and taste. The breakfast is very lavish. Nice staff, very courtaeous and helpful I would love to come back here again </DOC> strategically located on NH58. . has an excellent lobby with people welcoming you when you enter. comfortable check in process. request for upgrade was smilingly taken and upgrade given as well. complete cleanliness everywhere specially the room and its every corner. very good swimming pool </DOC> Had a business conference for full day in banquet, affordable rates, good service, nice staff, lunch at coffee shop is delightful, live music on Sunday , huge variety of veg and non veg items. Will book for further events in future also due to cooperative attitude . Lifts need some technical support, as key slot had issue , as well as aircon in lifts was not there. </DOC> We stayed in Radisson blu and for one the property and the rooms were superb. The rooms were very good and everything was very neat and clean and also the service was superb. The restaurant is the highlight of the Hotel. the staff there is very very attentive and good. would take care of minutest of details. Thw front desk was also very helpful with everything . Definitely worth a stay. </DOC> I have been staying at the property for quite some time now .. I prefer it because of it location on the main road .. good and healthy breakfast .. and good service levels .. what turned me down this time around is the falling standard of maintenance .. i checked in 2 times in a week since i was travelling out for one of the nights .. both the times i had different water issues in the bathroom .. i have bought it to the notice of the hotel staff and am sure they will improve it .. until then i will wait and check everytime I want to stay there .."
56,"The rooms were spacious with first class tolietries et al. The dinner menu was top class particularly the salad bar. The breakfast menu was first rate too.excellent paranthas on a cold February morning. Slightly Pricey but great place to stay. </DOC> The hotel was adequate, but not up to Radisson Blu's international standards. The rooms and hallways are a bit tired with stained carpets and some peeling paint. However, the beds are comfortable. The elevators are also strange and very slow. The staff was friendly and helpful and the buffet breakfast is good. It could be fantastic, but just needs a little work. The overall impression is that it is a bit tired. </DOC> I reviewed this hotel approx 2 years back and i had slammed it for a poor experience then with local staff, average food. This hotel has transformed itself since then. It has become a 4-Star Delhi hotel versus being a 5-Star Ghaziabad hotel - and you know former is better. The hotel has a great advantage of location. The rooms were always modern, business hotel basic rooms. Another thing that has improved is food and the staff was professional and refined. Kudos Radisson Blu on positive transformation. </DOC> This is a terrific business hotel with excellent, proactive and attentive front desk staff. The buffet restaurant serves up a large selection of Indian and Western food that is fresh and tasty. Overall excellent value for money. </DOC> Absolutely a tremendous hotel, outstanding service, the management has ensured that guests will enjoy the hospitality at its best, cleanliness and housekeeping was spic and span, rooms were tidy spacious and beautiful, breakfast spread was very good and delicious, location is perfect. </DOC> Radisson Kaushambi never fails to deliver it's brilliance, it's my second stay here and have always been extremely satisfied. The room décor is brilliant, food is outstanding and service is worldclass and it's situated at most convenient location. </DOC> My wife and I had accompanied my sister in law's family to this awesome hotel to celebrate the New Year Eve. Man, it was opulent to say the least. The hotel is beautifully laid out and one of the best just outside Delhi. Coming to the New Year Beat Up, good fun, the entertainment programme laid out was average, boring at times, but the food was great, the bar excellent and the band good. Walked around the hotel and saw that it was an excellent place for a business gathering and worth a stay anytime. </DOC> Nice Hotel, just besides NH24. Spent one night with family. What fun. Comfortable for an overnight stay. Nice rooms, decked up hotel for New Year eve! Front Office incharge Vineet.. special thanks for making the moment special. Spacious Clean rooms, good fruit platter (spent very less time at Hotel though) What could have gone well.. service speed on housekeeping and luggage collection."
57,"Visited the hotel on a business trip. Reached there early morning 2 o' clock. But was greeted by the alert duo behind the reception like the are fresh on a morning duty. Had some inconvenience in the room due to some paint smell. Next day morning upon request they were not only genuinely apologetic but promptly changed and upgraded the room. And this happened even with a almost sold hotel. Rooms are quite comfortable with all modern amenities and sleep quality is great. The swimming pool and the adjacent bar at the rooftop was fabulous. The spa is equally good with a fully equipped gym. Only the spa therapists may need some more training. The food spread is really great with a great options for both vegetarians and non veggies. I would particularly suggest the evening buffet. The staffs are ever smiling and with a warm attitude. I would rate the hotel great for solo and family travellers. </DOC> Well the way I would rate Rafisson Blu Ghaziabad is out of personal experience at mid year appraisal - 3.5 star. Which means - you are not bad, but you aren't good either!! Radisson Blu is a great average hotel. What helps it's cause is the fact that it's newly built. The staff is very rustic, while being nice. The rooms are exactly what you expect it to be. But it's pricing and proximity to delhi will ensure that you won't get it wrong. It's a perfect no-negative property! </DOC> I have choice this hotel @ last minute deal during my 1 night stay for my noida meeting. Hotel is nice, service, room, buffet break fast , check out all are quick nd nice. Love to visit again. Staff is fully trained nd warm welcome. </DOC> situated at the place arroung 1.30 hrs from airport and also far from new delhi.The reception lobby does not justifies that it is of a five star hotel,Room service is not that fast and no attracting spot arround.Rooms are quite spacious,clean Toilet are not such spacious,Bed are not much cozy, </DOC> Radisson Kushambhi is a very nice hotel , we had a wedding in july , it was a great experience e. This hotel is very well equipped for such event, The entire staff is very co operative and they know very well how to make a event successful and enjoyable. The charges are reasonable. Food is excellent; in fact it was very well customized to the taste of clients. Nice comfortable rooms and good restaurants. I will highly recommend this place for weddings. And even for business and holiday it is a good choice. </DOC> very nice looking property. lobby is large and airy and the buffer lunch is wonderfully set out with lots of options to suit all pallets. it also has a saturday pool party with DJ and meals so definitely worth a look </DOC> Located in Kaushambi, Ghaziabad and is easily approachable. The rooms are pretty neat, clean and tidy. Free Wi-Fi is provided and the speed was decent. Complimentary Buffet break-fast is provided and the spread was pretty good. The only place improvement is required is the Customer Service. They need to be more customer centric and Customer friendly. Except for the Customer Service for which I was not Satisfied, the Hotel scores on all other parameters. </DOC> Recently stayed in Radisson Blu Kaushambi. Located out of Delhi. Location is not great. Service is average too. Room was adequate, multiple onsite restaurants with poor service and average food. Pool was adequate but no towels available, again the staff was indifferent. Breakfast spread was also average."
58,"The hotel is good and well maintained. Checkin was smooth however check out was quite disturbing as the staff had lot of time to waste. Room was good, neat and well maintained. The restaurant offered variety of food but quite expensive. Breakfast offered menu from South Indian dishes to North Indian dishes. </DOC> the ambience is amazing and so was the check in and check out the food has become better and the variety specially in dessert has become huge. appam with vegetable stew was an icing on the cake. the spa services are awesome and so is the swimming pool </DOC> Nothing to write.It is a sheer Joy to stay in Radisson Blu Hotels.Front Desk staff are helpful as usual.The rooms cleanliness has nothing to complain about.The Bed makes you sleep like a baby! Best about this hotel ,they have a ""quick bite "" counter ,where one can just grab some cookies or fruits ,have some quick coffee or tea or a soft drink ,for those who are in a hurry to catch his flight or has to skip his breakfast.Would like to thank the front desk for arranging a take away breakfast kit as I had to check out early morning. </DOC> Repeating what most visitors would have already said about this hotel. Excellent behavior, staff attitude and high service standard right from the time you land at the reception. Rooms are large. Good sleep quality. </DOC> As usual, good front desk staff, predictably good rooms and good room service. Both the service and food quality were fine. If you want to take an early morning train out of the Anand Vihar Terminus, this is the place you want to go to- free drop to the station, packed decent sized breakfast, noise-free rooms with good linen. Of course, should suit any other business or tourist purpose as well. It is remarkable- almost all the Radisson's I've been to in India have great people- and this one was no exception. Wonder how their HR model works. </DOC> We were on a holiday trip with destination of Nainital. It was a stop over destination before a long journey. Therefore a comfortable hotel offering good quality sleep was the main requirement. We had very good experience. </DOC> i stayed in the hotel for business purpose for two days. check in was ok, rooms were kept clean, though interior appears to be old now. only problem i faced was taps not working in bathroom especially shower, maintaince was slightly poor. room service not great but ok. even breakfast was not excellent, but for business traveler its can be managed. overall average, all ok type. </DOC> I stayed here one night, got a quick drive (for Delhi conditions) from the airport, about an hour. Breakfast was really good, the room was clean and convenient. Unfortunately I arrived after 1 o'clock at night and the bar was already closed."
59,"This Hotel used to be Four Seasons years ago. Very effective check in and friendly staff guide you to your room. Large room with all you need. Large bathroom with comfy shower. Also comfy bed. Liked the gym too in the second floor. Will be back! </DOC> Stayed only for one night but it was spectacular. The gardens are beautiful, the rooms was very spacious and the service was off the chart - 7 stars. I was greeted by name as I got out of the car (still not sure how they knew it was me - never stayed there before). My sheet was ready for check-in at reception, when I picked up bags from the concierge they magically appeared in 15 seconds - amazing. Wifi was very functional (a pet peeve in many other hotels), bathrooms were generous. The hotel is somewhat removed from downtown Tokyo, but the hotel has generous shuttle services. Will definitely stay again. Obviously, getting a garden view room would be a plus. </DOC> The hotel is clean and the service is nice. But is outdated, probably need a renovate. Plus it is in the middle of nowhere, need to take a 25-30 mins cab drive every day to get to the center of Tokyo. That's probably why the price is cheap. There are a lot of amenities in the hotel. </DOC> This is the first time that I stayed in the property since it ceased being a Four Seasons, but to be honest you can't notice the difference. This is a very good hotel, with beautiful grounds and good facilities. It is a bit annoying that prices in the bar (and in the mini-bar!) are outlandishly expensive, but that's life. Overall this property never disappoints, and I would certainly come back again. </DOC> Our last two nights in Japan so we’d booked something a bit special. We weren’t disappointed. We had a very well appointed room with large windows overlooking the hotel’s gardens and indoor pool. We tried two of the restaurants and found the food to be excellent. The staff were very friendly and couldn’t have been more helpful. Our only disappointment was that we didn’t realise that the hotel provided a shuttle bus to the airport (at a small charge), we found out too late. The hotel is a little bit out of the centre of Tokyo, but is only a 10 minute walk to the nearest underground station. </DOC> Former a Four Seasons Hotel, now Chinzanso Hotel obviously focuses more on japanese customs, especially for weddings. Nevertheless, due to the fact that wedding parties are held in the Chinzanso Annex, the Hotel itself is a wonderful oasis of peace and calm, beautiful rooms with sight on the huge, magnificent garden, great SPA (only for Hotel Guests) and Onsens. Only negative point: the Room Service Menu is smaller and less interesting then under Four Seasons management. The Breakfast (in room) needs improvements: only 1 juice, only 1 beverage, only either toasts or pastry - everything else extra charged..... not up to date nowadays, with inferior hotels offering huge buffets..... But you will enjoy the calm rooms and the very nice service (especially Danielle at the Concierge!!!!) </DOC> Now, there are many first-class hotels in Tokyo, but if you want to stay in a tranquility, out of the hustle and bustle of Tokyo, still this hotel is the place to stay !! The rooms are spacious and clean and you can see the wonderful Japanese Garden from your room. Beds are very comfy and toiletries are L'Occitane. I love the restaurants of this hotel, and also the staffs are very attentive. If you are looking for crowds or nightlife, go to Shinjuku, Ikebukuro, or Shibuya !! But, after your time in those places, it's a great pleasure to come back to this hotel. </DOC> The hotel is beautiful as one would expect from a luxury hotel in Tokyo. But - it is the gardens - acres and acres of landscaped serenity - that makes this hotel exceptional. It is about 1/2 hour away from downtown Tokyo and the Ginza - and for some this may be a drawback - but it is more than compensated for by the views and the surroundings. The staff provide exceptional service - charming, helpful, incredibly efficient and still very discreet. Everyone you meet in the hotel treats you as though you are very special - client orientation is clearly very high on their list. This service attitude is something the west could learn. It makes the stay that much more special and leaves you wanting to return. Should I return to Tokyo this would be the hotel I would choose to stay at."
60,"This is a classic hotel, former four seasons. Rooms are extremely spacious in classic decoration, though not walking distance to subway, taxi is not that bad. Airport limousine stops over but schedule not as frequent. Not to miss Japanese breakfast, which is great. The onsen water are transport form real onsen, also not to miss. Slightly pricey especially in Sakura season but I'm sure it is worth it, </DOC> An enormous hotel with 9 F&B outlets and 37 ballrooms, a venue for both business and tourist travellers. Rooms are gorgeously furnished in elegant design of old. The highlight of this hotel is it’s famous gardens which blooms Sakura during spring and has beautiful autumn colours in the fall. One of a kind </DOC> I stayed here with my family during the Christmas Holiday. A great hotel with nice rooms, lobby, restaurant and breathtaking garden. But one thing I want to point out is the service, the staff were very helpful and attentive! Staff service is more than excellent! The only down side is the location of the hotel, it is quite far from the city center and the nearest train station is quite far. But overall a great hotel! </DOC> We had a great stay at this hotel. The rooms were very large and well decorated, beautiful toilets and amenities. They have a breathtaking and peaceful garden. The metro station is a nice 10 minutes stroll away. Every member of staff was super. Really thank you. </DOC> The Hotel Chinzanso Tokyo is in the middle of a beautiful garden, with a 1000 year old Pagoda, not the hustle and bustle of Tokyo, but this is incredibly refreshing. Rooms are spacious. Staff are very friendly. Multiple options for eating, both in the hotel itself and on the property. A luxury escape that is only a short cab ride (or 30 minute walk) from everything else Tokyo. </DOC> Just having spent ten wonderful days in the Chinzanso Hotel we must say the stay has been wonderful. The garden is beautiful. location wise, a good ten minute walk to the closest subway and not an easy WLL on the way back as the hill go the hotel is a little steep, but a nice walk and easy to find the subway. We paid 3000 yen from the hotel to Tokyo Station which is really not so bad. Only negative about the hotel is that there are very few restaurants withing walking distance and the hotel prices are too expensive. </DOC> This used to be a 4 seasons hotel for 20 years and the contract expired and not renewed. From a service perspective, it does not need to be a 4 Seasons. Service is impeccable. I went with my family and while a visit to the garden and the soba restaurant is a must that is a one day activity at most. The hotel is far from the very practical and absolutely necessary train network(closest being Mejiro) and a bus is a bit of a waste of time and a taxi ride is about 800-1000 yen. Restaurant and even breakfast is over priced. </DOC> A lovely hotel set in a residential location in Tokyo. Excellent service, food, & helpful. The only downside is that if you have a short time in Tokyo you are a little out of the main shopping areas. The rooms are large and clean. Very friendly staff."
61,"This was a reasonably priced location not more than 5 or 10 minutes from the subway stations and a JR Yamanote stop. It's easy to get to other parts of Tokyo from here so perfect for a short break. The staff were helpful and the breakfasts, although on the pricey side, were of good quality. Would stay there again. There's a fine little Izakaya just down the street, called Masuya standing bar. Actually you don't have to stand as, even if there is no room downstairs, there is usually some upstairs. Prices are very reasonable and the food is good. It's a smoking place so you may be unlucky to be sat next to someone who lights up. </DOC> Super property in a nice quiet area close to Tokyo Tower. Everything went just right from checking in to checking out. They have a good buffet breakfast. A little pricey, but a good meal. We had lunch in the restaurant twice and it's a real bargain. The room as spotless, and the cleaning daily was fine. The desk people spoke enough English so we could be understood. All in all, I can't think of a nicer place to stay in Tokyo. </DOC> Out tour company had booked this. Hotel in our tour and we booked an extra Day earlier because if our early arrival. Simple good rooms Excellent breakfast, convienent location . They were very helpful with explaining direction to the metro etc. </DOC> Direct bus from Narita (¥3,000) before 17:30 or walk/taxi (¥2,000) from TCAT central bus station out of above hours. Staff are very attentive, helpful and friendly. Great location for Hamamatsucho (JR line from Tokyo Station) and Onarimon (Toei Mita line). Lots of good variety of eateries close by - try the Benita restaurant at bottom of road if you like Indian food. Rooms are small but well equipped with fridge, kettle and vending/ice machine in corridor. Usual toiletries provided in bathroom. Free wifi available in both rooms and reception. </DOC> The location of this hotel is reasonable for trains or subways and excellent for backstreet eateries. The staff ensure your stay is pleasant with unfailing friendliness and courtesy. The twin room was comfortable, clean and of reasonable size. We we only there for one night after a long haul flight and appreciated the quiet and calm. The architectural detail of the annex foyer is very good. </DOC> This good mid-range hotel is well-positioned close to a JR station and in a quiet business area but with two convenience stores immediately adjacent and lots of cafes and restaurants nearby. Staff are welcoming, friendly and helpful. Our room had everything we needed and the bed was comfortable. The buffet breakfast, with both Japanese and Western food, was good. Recommended. </DOC> This hotel is in a quiet neighbourhood, close to the Tokyo Tower and an easy walk to several subway and rail lines. The staff were friendly and our checking in and out were fast. Our room was in the annex, just across the road from the reception area, which was no hassle at all. Our room was large by Japanese standards, very clean and well appointed. The only issue was the free wifi, which ranged from unavailable at some times to unreliable and flaky. It was a frustrating part of what was otherwise a very pleasant stay. </DOC> This hotel was booked for us and I am quite certain our hosts had no idea of it's state. The carpet was threadbare. I have never seen such a tired looking hotel. The staff were not as helpful as we generally experience in Japan. The breakfast buffet was overpriced. There are Starbucks and Excelsio nearby where you can easily have breakfast for less than 1/2 the price. The heat in our room was unbearable considering it was coat and gloves weather outside. We opened the window. On the upside, it is quiet and near stations and restaurants. Look elsewhere."
62,"Amazing stay thoroughly recommend this hotel lovely area to stay full of greenery and the hotel went above and beyond. We had an amazing origami lesson with Yuka so do this if you get a chance lovely dinner in the steak restaurant </DOC> Hotel staff were okay but that was the only reasonable thing about this hotel. The rooms in this hotel are miniature - and the bathrooms are even smaller! There is literally only just enough room to stand up in the bathroom. The hotel furnishings are dirty and the carpets are stained. The whole hotel seems old and tired. The air conditioning managed to stop the room from getting hot but didn't work well enough to cool the room down. The hotel consists of two buildings - a main building with an annex across the street. The annex building has a musty smell. My recommendation would be to stay at a hotel in the Ginza area which is a better location and has far better hotels. During my stay at the hotel it was full of backpackers, which seems to be the standard of this hotel. </DOC> This hotel is at a very good location very near the Tokyo tower & the shrine It offers good convenience from proximity to business districts as well as tourist centers of attraction There are many reasonable food joints nearby offering good Japanese & other international cuisines </DOC> spent one night at this hotel we arrived late at night. we took the monorail from haneda airport to hamamatsucho station. it was about 25 mins on the monorail, and a 5 minute walk from hamamatsucho station to the hotel. our room was in the annexe building behind the main hotel. it was a bit dark walking across into the annexe building late at night. the room decor is also a bit dark and unwelcoming, and the room very small, not much room to move with luggage. staff were generally friendly and helpful, and the breakfast was very nice. </DOC> This is a business hotel in the Shiba park area. Close to Shinbashi and Hamamatsucho areas. Rooms are standard size and come with regular amenities. Service staff is very nice and helpful. Nothing really great about the hotel but nothing bad either. Lots of restaurants on site. My room smelled like smoke. The elevator is slow at points. There is free Wifi in the lobby. This is a central neighborhood, but is mostly office buildings. So nightlife is most after weekdays after work. </DOC> This was my first visit to Japan and the first Japanese hotel that I stayed in. It was a most pleasant experience. Having found my way easily from Daimon subway station (5min walk) I got to the reception and found check-in to be ultra quick. The room (double) was clean and nice with all the four star facilities. There was nothing to complain about! Breakfast was good and the restaurant staff charming. The bar was rather pricy but then everything in Japan is rather pricy. There is a Japanese style restaurant as well as a western style one. The front desk will change currency with the minimum of paper work. There are plenty of small supermarkets (7/11 type), ATMs and fast food outlets nearby. This is an ideal place to make your base in Tokyo. Finally, the staff were extremely helpful, knowledgeable and charming but then most Japanese are! </DOC> Very very helpful staff from check in to check out, full of knowledge and a desire to help. Easy access to two subway lines, close to Tokyo tower , easy access to fish market on subway or easy cab fare which desk arranged for us to see early morning tuna auction. Lots of 7-11 nearby, lots of restaurants easy walk, cleaning staff very thorough, 2 English TV channels, very good wifi, small fridge. Bus from airport stops here which is very convenient. Rooms not large but adequate, bed pretty good.. A great short stay for me! </DOC> We used this hotel as our base for touring Tokyo. It is within walking distance of both JR and Metro stops. We had a small double room in the annex at the back of the hotel. The room was quite dated in terms of furniture and fittings with a terrible view of the back of other buildings. The towels in the bathroom were small and thin. The reception area was nice and staff were polite and helpful. Breakfast was of limited choice but adequate. Dinner was expensive especially drinks, my small glass of wine was ~£9. If I was staying again I would opt for a larger room in the main hotel building."
63,"We stayed at this property for two nights at the start of our visit to Japan. As this was part of a group booking, I cannot reliably comment on value for money as I,m not sure how the pricing was built into our overall cost. Check in was uneventful and the rooms had obviously been pre assigned as were were handed a room key and envelope with breakfast vouchers. Personally we found the hotel to be rather dark and dated with a lingering smell of smoke around, however the rooms were adequate, clean and an acceptable size for Tokyo, and all amenities provided including wi-fi in the rooms. Breakfast was a choice of Japanese or Western, Western being served in their sister building directly across the small road. The choice was sufficient, not really hot but acceptable should you not wish to eat Japanese. Location was good, close to the subway and many restaurants and shopping. </DOC> I was amazed by the value for money of this hotel. The rooms were very big especially on japanese standards, everything very clean and great staff. Location is great, only 3 stops from Tokyo station and with heaps of cafes and restaurants nearby. Highly recommended </DOC> The old hotel is OK. Reasonably comfortable, the staff were excellent very helpful. It is clean and tidy, the rooms are small, but expected of 3 star. It could be called a budget hotel. They are building a new hotel which should be OK. Reasonable for 2 to 3 nights. Plenty of shops etc in the vicinity. 2 km walk to the designer shops. </DOC> I liked this hotel, it had a nice feel to it. What I didn't like quite so much was the size of the rooms. But I think that is the case for ALL rooms in Tokyo. It is very handy for catching trains and buses and Zojoji Temple and the Tokyo tower are close by. </DOC> Stayed here for my first few introductory days in Tokyo and it was wonderful. The room was spacious and clean. Staff super friendly. The hotel offers some workshops, including a free origami one - don't miss it! Myself and my friend were the only ones participating and had a great time, laughing so much with the guy teaching us. Location of the hotel is fab and price was reasonable. Highly recommended! </DOC> We listened to the previous reviews and got room in annex on the one floor (6) with built in wifi (everywhere else has wired Internet). There is also free wifi in the annex lobby. Room had view of a wall and air conditioner was loud but otherwise was very positive experience for the extremely reasonable $150 peak season price. Room was clearly of older style but renovated. It was clean and beds were comfortable. Breakfast was included in our rate, which is a huge plus in Tokyo. Staff was helpful but not quite as well trained as in higher level hotels. When asked explicitly and in culturally appropriate way, they responded well. However, better trained staff work harder to anticipate your needs and offer their assistance generously without having to be asked. Loved the location near Shiba Park and Tokyo tower. Nice to be able to walk to several attractions in the area. </DOC> The hotel is well located near the Tokyo Tower and subway stations. Rooms are smallish, but clean and comfortable. As a first-time visitor to Tokyo, I was surprised at how quiet and uncrowded this area of the city is. However, there is a wide range of restaurants and facilities very close by. Hotel has a very pleasant rugby themed bar. Staff were extremely polite and obliging. For those travellers who need to do their own laundry, there is a very...er... compact guest laundry available with washing, drying and ironing facilities. </DOC> We stayed in the annex, which is in the building behind the one where registration is. This hotel is tucked away in a quiet neighborhood, but is close to several metro stations and and two convenience stores. This was a great spot to explore the city as we could return to a quieter neighborhood in the evenings. That said, you do have a bit more travel time to get to the popular areas of Tokyo. The hotel was clean and well appointed."
64,"pros: 1.)located in a central location 2.)rooms are decent on tokyo standards (size smaller than that in rest of the world) cons: 1.)the restaurant is extremely rigid and narrow minded to accommodate any modifications to the standard. for e.g. in spite of giving a request in writing, the restaurant couldn't prepare anything vegetarian for us 2.)there was something called as curry pilaf which was like fried rice with some meat. it was an impossible task for them to make curry pilaf without meat for 3-4 people but if you just want to sleep in Tokyo, this place is good.Dont expect any steam,sauna,Jacuzzi,good food etc </DOC> I stayed in this hotel for couple of nights. The hotel is located very close to Tokyo Tower. The check in process was smooth and quick. The good thing is that the hotel don't charge you during the check in. The room is ok but a little small. There is hot breakfast that you can avail in the morning. There are multiple good restaurants in 5-10 mins walk near the restaurant. The other good thing about the hotel is that you can get direct limounise bus service from Narita International Airport to this hotel. The check out process was also very smooth and quick. </DOC> I’m not what to think about this hotel. The staff is nice. Breakfast is fairly nice. Location is good. And the rooms in the main building seem very nice, too. But I stayed in the annex which is across the street and more like a youth hostel or a Days Inn along a freeway in the 70’s. I feel very bad for the staff which was perfect more or less. Unfortunately there was nothing on my itinerary stating I would be in the annex so it’s just just important for future guests of this hotel to double check this. </DOC> This hotel is excellently located - close to the metro, JR lines and the monorail to Haneda airport. When we arrived we received a warm and friendly welcome and the staff couldn't have done more to be helpful and friendly throughout our stay. The room was spacious (for Tokyo!) and comfortable. We found the place spotlessly clean and the cleaning ladies took a shine to our young son which he found very pleasing! If I had one negative it was that if you are traveling for business (as I often do) then the wifi in the rooms isn't really quick enough to work easily. If you are on holiday though, and just want to check your e-mails then it's fine. There is also free, quicker Internet in the lobby. Overall I would return here the next time I travel to Tokyo with family. </DOC> Could not get into the first choice on Saturday night so my local agent booked this for me. It was fine with very courteous helpful staff. Clearly aiming at the tourist market with some business travellers for good measure. Spacious rooms for Tokyo and bright and clean. Breakfast was resonably good too. If I was stuck again, I would certainly try it again, but it would not be my first choice. </DOC> We stayed three nights there as part of our Discover Japan Tour with Wendy Wu. The hotel location was excellent, but the room is in urgent need of an upgrade. We were at the annex, where the restaurants and reception are. Free and decent wifi. Room was reasonably neat and tidy. The two restaurants were quite good. </DOC> Very nice tidy rooms . Very clean and we'll maintained. Great staff and very good breakfast. Nice restaurant for dinner and one of the most comfortable beds I have slept in for quite some time. A very good deal. Highly recommend. </DOC> The good was the location and the moderate cost. The staff were quite exceptional - helpful almost telepathetic and knowledgable, Thank you Mr Ichinomiya and Ms Akimoto. Breakfast was good value also. The not good was the need to turn the A/C off and open the window to expel the heat and the 2nd hand smoke. The room were quite small. Warning - Japan is not a smoke free zone, although significant changes are being made. A non-smoking room on a smoking floor does not work, especially at a temperature of about 26 'winter' degrees. A non-smoking booth next to a smoking one at Japanese restaurants in three different cities left an unfortunate long forgotton taste."
65,"Great service even by Japanese standards. Staff is very accommodating and friendly. Rooms are clean and adequately appointed. Good wi-fi coverage. Close and convenient to trains, shops, restaurants and many business offices. </DOC> This hotel is well placed for Tokyo tower and an easy walk to most places. It is basic with an austere air. The reception areas were unwelcoming although the staff were helpful. Bedrooms were adequate and comfortable and quiet but nothing special. </DOC> Right in town, easy acces. Small rooms, friendly service. Japanese and European breakfast at your choice. The hotel is working on a serious extension, but it does not bother your stay really. No view and little daylight in the room, small but comfortable bathroom. </DOC> We stayed here for a stopover en route from London to Tokyo. Helpful staff, nice and quiet with the usual Japanese attention to detail. The room was a bit small and the hotel needs new carpets, but it was great for a rest. Direct bus from Narita or the Narita Express and a 30 minute walk. Free coffee, pastries and wifi. </DOC> Nice hotel in a good location. Clean and friendly. Don't expect amazing views but just a short walk from stations, shops and Tokyo Tower. Staff very friendly and informative. As with everywhere in Japan the toilets are amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! </DOC> Large sized room. Comfortable bed. Great shower and bath - quality toiletries provided. Tea/coffee facilities in room. Wi fi good in all areas. Nearest subway 5 min walk away. Jr station + monorail (airport link) only 10 mins walk away. Restaurant expensive but great steak available. All staff friendly, welcoming and polite. Good English spoken. Free origami class on offer + furoshiki class (gift wrapping with traditional Japanese cloth method) which I enjoyed at a very modest price. Several 7/11 stores close by . </DOC> We stayed here twice in the course of our holiday in Japan. The second time we had a much bigger room, possibly because we were staying longer than the first time. The essentials were all there and the beds were comfortable. There was a choice of Japanese or Western meals in the evening and both cuisines were catered for at breakfast. The hotel is well situated for visiting Tokyo, being only a short walk from both a rail station. The staff were brilliant and the Waygu steak was cooked to perfection for me. Like many hotels, the Shiba Park caters for a lot of tour groups, which makes meal times somewhat awkward but it was definitely good value. </DOC> Service was excellent. I was meeting up with my daughter so had travelled to Tokyo separately. The hotel offered to help her should she need any assistance getting to the hotel and would pay any taxi fare on my behalf until my arrival, They didn't even have my credit card details, trusting me to reimburse them later! It was worth paying the extra for a superior twin for a larger room. Tokyo hotel rooms can be very small and as I was staying with my 20 yo daughter, space was important! Subway close by, and the JR line which made it easy and with a Japan Rail Pass - no extra costs."
66,"We were placed at the annex area where you have to cross to the other building. I suggest they place a rooftop on where the guests will cross because of the heat/rain/snow. The amenities were great. They even had a pajama for you to wear. The bathroom was average in size. There was no English movie channels, just a couple of English News channels. They had a smoking area & money exchange machine at the ground floor. The exchange rate was great. It was walking distance to a lot of places. The had a nearby 7-Eleven & Familymart. </DOC> Stayed here on first 2 nights of our Japanese holiday. Good sized clean room. Good service too. Choice of western or Japanese breakfast, but as they were in separate restaurants all in our party had to make the same choice if we wanted to eat together. Near to metro. Would stay again. </DOC> Many of the hotels and ryokans we stayed in only offered japanese food in their buffets. We enjoy this however, sometimes it's nice to have a good croissant and egg dishes. The hotel itself is average...located in a quiet, somewhat uninteresteing neighborhood but it was very clean and we slept comfortably. </DOC> this old has two building, old and new. the old one is not nice, so do book your room int the new building. the downside is nobody help us with our bags when checking in. the room is nearly furbished, it is comfortable and clean. </DOC> I was a little disappointed in the room - it was in the annexe and was rather dull and run down - first impressions of the reception etc. was what a lovely hotel but as I say the room was not at all good - pillows and beds hard - bathroom cramped. Having said that the location was good and the staff were brilliant. Food and drink a bit pricey. </DOC> The good : Good location within walking distance of Daemon metro station and Hamamatsucho JR station. Competent staff in reception. Decent-sized room for Tokyo. Clean bathroom and toilet. The rest is sub-par. Ugly room with very questionable taste furnishings , poor breakfast, Japanese or Western, a bed cover - duvet combination that has not been cleaned regularly, and 1990s (or worse) Internet speeds. I know Tokyo well and stayed here because of all other reasonably priced options being full in the area, and can confidently say that there are MUCH BETTER options for the price. Ryumeikan close to Tokyo Station, or Mitsui Garden Shiodome Italia Gai in the same area of Shiba Park (closer to Hamamatsucho station) are incommensurably better options in a similar price bracket. One to forget. </DOC> Situated in a quiet street not far from Shiba temple this hotel in close to shops, places to eat and Daimon subway station.Rooms are comfortable and reasonable size for a Tokyo hotel.USB ports are in each room along with a refrigerator. Would stay here again.Free wifi </DOC> in 2017 in Developed countries wifi should work whether paid or not. Spent three nights in the annex 604 and I had to go down to the lobby to do work and write this review. The hotel is dated but is clean and centrally located. But sadly no wifi- Never again nor would I recommend."
67,"My wife and I enjoyed a 4 night stay here as part of a tour group. Although not large the rooms are very well presented, clean, comfortable and quiet ensuring a good nights sleep. The bathroom was a little tight on space but functional and well stocked with every amenity the you would need. Breakfast offered both western or Japanese style foods in different rooms. We use Cafe Primula and found it excellent with charming staff. In fact all staff at the Shiba Park are both welcoming and helpful. It's walking distance to several shrines and the Tokyo Tower and subway and lots of restaurant choices nearby. A great location and well recommended. We hope to return again to enjoy a further stay. </DOC> Stayed in annexe. Room ok with small en-suite with entertaining Japenese style toilet. Tea making facilities, but rather large flask to heat water up with. All staff very helpful. No tour brochures visible, you have to ask at desk and they produce them. All bus tours are accompanied by guide. We were going to go on Big Red Bus tour but apparently you cannot get on or off them at will, as you can in other countries. Tokyo tower wonderful views and views from World Trade Centre at night are breathtaking. Take a trip on a ferry from Hinode Pier. We went to Odaiba Seaside Park and spent an entertaining few hours in a cafe people watching. </DOC> This was a pre-booked hotel by our tour company, it was a good choice. We were especially grateful that the hotel gave us an early book-in as my travelling companion had had a rough flight from Helsinki in severe pain and wouldn't have lasted until the normal 1400 hrs check-in. Our room in this multi building complex was well fitted out and clean but could have done with a facelift. Location is good with many eating places nearby and basic services such as a chemist and it's within walking distance of the Tokyo Tower and temples. Overall a pleasant 3 night stay. </DOC> As most reviews state, the rooms (at least in the annex where we stayed) are quite spacious by Japanese standards, and the proximity to eateries, convenience stores, the Yamanote Rail line (JR), and the subway are excellent and an easy walk. Staff were friendly and attentive. The wi-fi was good, and there was a guest laundry on the 4th floor, which was really our only cause for complaint. We were given room 401 which is off the small foyer where the laundry and the elevators are, and noise at night from people coming and going and saying goodnight etc was noticeable. On our last night I had to go out and ask about a dozen young Americans who were literally partying in the foyer while waiting for their laundry to be quiet - so don't take room 401! </DOC> stayed for 5 nights in a triple room. the room size was adequate & amenities decent.The reception staff were very efficient & helpful with direction, etc with a good working knowledge of English.The Hammamatsucho & Daimon station & Haneda monorail were a 5-10 minute walk away. The 7/11 store around the corner was very useful.Did not use the breakfast option as was too expensive. Restaurant menus were not appealing. </DOC> Surprisingly the room was pretty big for Tokyo. The extra amenities was nice and the staff was very helpful. We only stayed one night as we were heading to Kyoto but would definitely stay again. Walking distance to Tokyo tower. </DOC> Handy for Haneda Airport by monorail. Hotel in 2 parts with street in between. Very good price for Tokyo but would not recommend if wanting to be a tourist. Rooms are OK but clearly only a 3 star property at best. </DOC> The hotel is located in a walkable distance from subway. It has two buildings, better rooms are in the newer one. Rooms in this building are modern, spacey and well equipped. Helpful reception staff speaking quite good English. Free WiFi works well. Steak restaurant with a good selection of international meals, also a good offer for breakfast. We will happily come again."
68,"Stayed at the hotel for two nights, as part of a tour of Japan. Hotel very comfortable and clean, and has a good choice of Japanese breakfast, or Western. The hotel has free wi fi , in the lobby. The hotel is also in walking distance of the Tokyo underground (Daimon station) which links to the rest of the underground network. </DOC> The hotel was clean and the staff were very obliging. The rooms however were not very functional and well worn. I realise that rooms in Tokyo are small however the shape of the room did not allow for a good layout of a bed with built in furniture and chair / table. Consequently the bed was pushed right up to the window wall & getting around it was like completing an obstacle course. To make matters worse the small window is in one corner giving a very dark & unwelcoming atmosphere. The bottom line is that the room was not at all comfortable to relax in and you get what you pay for. In this case we never broke the bank so we got at best it got a very average hotel! </DOC> We only stayed here one night but the this hotel is within walking distance of some great attractions in Tokyo. The hotel feels like a business hotel and has all the modern amenities one would expect from a good business hotel - such as free wi-fi. The hotel is undergoing some renovations at the moment but it is very clean and there was no disruption caused by the renovations. </DOC> The location near Tokyo Tower is very good. I think the secret here is to make sure you are in the Annex which is just across a little street in back of the main hotel. We had a small problem with a strange odor on about the 3rd day of a 7 day stay, and the staff was super attentive and moved us right away. We didn't take any meals there, and the restaurants looked very expensive--too much so for the neighborhood. All in all, a good value. We actually had a triple since my grown daughter traveled with us at the last minute. </DOC> Close to Daimon tube station and close to Tokyo Tower and Zojoji temple. Small rooms and bathrooms but comfortable and clean. Breakfast either western or Japanese (only tried Western but substantial). Pain au chocolate and croissants excellent. Staff extremely accommodating and friendly. Then again, I think this is normal in Japan. We suffered the minor aftershock of an earth tremor and the staff were quick to react. </DOC> Had four days in this hotel. The hotel rooms are a tad dated but have everything you need. Hotel is a really good location for subway, and restaurants, would highly recommend looking for restaurants down side streets off Diamond street, Macdonald's is on diamond Street. Lots of nice places to eat, Spanish, Italian and curries. The hotel is also a mere 15 minute walk from Tokyo tower, you can see the tower from the hotel, must do, but at night time. The only negative picky tiny thing is the hotel dryer, something from the 70's and I couldn't use my own hairdryer due to the voltage difference! </DOC> Very clean, functional and friendly hotel in a great location. Close to transport links and lots of convenience stores and temple area. Also good access to Tokyo Tower. Best thing is breakfast omelette. Yum!! How do they do the firm outside soft inside? Wish the chef had teaching sessions. </DOC> Room comfortable, clean. Liked the location as well. Quiet location, very near to street with nice coffee shop (Seattle) and restaurants. Tokyo tower also worth visiting nearby. Restaurant for breakfast very good. Staff very helpful, pointing out good places to eat etc."
69,"This hotel was above all others that I have stayed at. Top notch staff, the rooms are beautiful with a scene of the entire city, I was on the top floor and couldn't believe my view. They offer assistance for those of us that some things were difficult to understand and their wine area is wonderfully relaxing. I did the 1/2 day bus guided tour by myself which included the temple, the bridges water tour and kappabashi street. Everything about my stay, even walking around feeling extremely safe, was just perfect for business (although I added a little personal to it myself). I traveled here a while ago - but am posting this now. </DOC> Stayed here with points. Room was terrific. Be sure to ask for the bayside view which includes the gardens and Rainbow Bridge. Included breakfast was excellent. Lots of choices. Service was also top notch. Great location. Excellent gardens across the street. Fish market a short walk as is the Ginza. </DOC> We absolutely loved our room here. From the floor to ceiling views of Tokyo to the glass wall between the bath and bedroom, it was all breathtaking. The staff as expected are excellent and always attentive. We were with a large group and they worked hard to accommodate everyone. Thank you! </DOC> Arrived early at Conrad, but got still an room although 2 hours before official check in time. Was upgraded to Executive floor. Lounge was fanstastic with nice food selections. Both evening food and breakfast was very good. Room itself was OK and big plus for havning both shower and bathtub. Staff without exception was very service comittted and helpful. All in all a great hotel and I would definetely stay here again. </DOC> Stayed here for a two day business trip and found all offices fairly close by. The check-in experience was a bit cumbersome due to some mix up with the names. After a long haul flight this is not really what I was waiting for but OK. The rooms are spacious and well set-up. The gym is not that large but sufficient, although I would not be surprised it it gets crowded from time to time. I didn't try the lap pool, but it looked very OK. Breakfast has all you need and the lounge/bar area is a great hang out place with nice views over the bay. Service is OK. The internet service, even if paid for, is not that fast which I had not expected. </DOC> The rooms are very nice, with a huge bed, wonderful bathroom, including a walk-in rainshower and separate toilet. The room was impeccably clean (as usual in Japan). Shiodome is a rather unexciting location, but fortunately is very well connected. Shimbashi station is only 5 minutes walking distance from the hotel, otherwise one can use the Shiodome subway stop. The desk was a bit smallish. Service was polite and courteous, but found something lacking for such an upscale hotel and it cannot compete to some of the other high end luxury hotels in Tokyo, such as the Park Hyatt Tokyo. Business centre is free, which is great. The swimming pool was very nice and free for Hilton honors silver, gold, or diamond members. There was very noticeable cigarette smoke in the lobby, which simply does not fit in such a luxury hotel. </DOC> The Conrad Tokyo might be the best hotel I've ever stayed at. Tokyo has a surplus of great, high-end hotels, but the Conrad's attention to detail puts it at the top. Every employee we interacted with was over-the-top helpful. They upgraded us to the executive floor, even though my Hilton Honors gold status doesn't require them to. The lounge itself has great views of the Rainbow Bridge and the bay, and Hamarikyu Gardens are right next door (definitely worth a visit). Our room had high ceilings, wonderful shower, and sweeping views. I look forward to staying again on our next trip to Japan! </DOC> Had a series of company meetings at the Conrad Tokyo. Guest rooms were very comfortable. Bathroom was interesting. Had a huge tub and a toilet with more electronics than my car. Meeting rooms were good but we needed a few additional rooms and ended up holding training in the chapel. While I admire their flexibility, it wasn't perfect. Staff was extremely helpful. Highly recommend."
70,"A short stay in November confirmed my earlier review (jan '14 stay) that the Conrad is a wonderful hotel for service, room design and room view (this time I enjoyed Bay view!). Everything works well and the Spa is worthwhile to indulge when you have flown 12+ hours! Superb fitness and classes being offered! </DOC> Located on the top floors of an office building provides great views. I reserved the one bedroom suite for me and my family. Great space, large bathroom with a guest toilet near the entrance. Excellent room service for breakfast with good, dependable service as you would expect from the Japanese. Highly recommend and for those who want to be within walking distance to ginza this is a good home base. </DOC> A lovely hotel with typical Conrad excellence. Beautiful rooms with large and well-appointed baths. Breakfast buffet a standout. Lounge 28 offers stunning views and a lovely place for drinks but I was surprised that the lounge still offers a smoking-section, which made for a diminished experience. Staff could not have been nicer and even after just a couple of days I was greeted warmly with a ""nice to see you again."" My only critique is that this hotel is slightly set apart from the central part of Ginza and I had trouble obtaining accurate directions. The area around it seems heavily geared to Tokyo business, and not so favorable to newcomers looking to explore the city on foot. Nonetheless, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this lovely hotel. </DOC> We loved every minute of our stay at Conrad Tokyo. Hotel is beautiful with very confortable and modern rooms. Location is ideal for exploring city with great location close to Ginza and many other attractions. Executive floor amenities like breakfast are worth trying. </DOC> Been a few years since I last stayed. The kids are bigger so we got two connecting rooms instead of a one bedroom suite. The standard rooms are large for tokyo. The hotel in on the quiet side of the city but still walking distance or a short taxi ride to ginza and tokyo station. there are a few shops and restaurants around the area which are accessible via connecting halls underground. The lobby where you check in are not on street level so you take another lift up. That provides a bit of privacy and exclusivity. </DOC> This is my first visit to Conrad Hotel (my ninth visit to Tokyo), and this time we choose Conrad because of the location and the size of the rooms. From the moment we checked in, until we checked out, the experience was flawless. The staffs are very friendly, rooms are as expected and considered big for Tokyo standard. Location is convenient, close to the stations and also fish market. Certainly will come back again. </DOC> My stay was too short; I would move in and live there permanently. The Conrad is a beautiful and spectacular modern hotel with all the right touches. I'm a Hilton Honors Diamond member so my perspective is already positively biased. The suite I stayed in would be loved by any condo-loving Manhattanite. It was huge. The bed was heavenly. The bathroom is a mini-complex unto itself. There are two large flatscreen TVs. The view southwards towards Tokyo Bay was pretty at night. The gym on the fitness floor was spacious enough. The continental breakfast presented an inspiring selection and filled me up for the day's journey. </DOC> Great rooms, great views and the costs that go with it, the only place that charged a ""service charge"" for a meal- shame on you Hilton! My only gripe with this hotel is if your going to set the standard for service high and then charge for it you have to get it right, you serve whisky in a tumbler not a wine glass and if a guest says they don't want ice you don't put it in! Staff were helpful and willing to try their best with little requests that make such a difference when your away like early breakfasts."
71,"I stayed 1 night here after we extended our business trip with 1 day, and the hotel we stayed in had no more free rooms. At I am very glad we got to see this hotel. The view is spectacular, and the service is great. The rooms are wonderful! The beds are a little too hard, but other than that - nothing to complain about! </DOC> We've stayed at the Park Hyatt in Tokyo - stunning hotel, location is a bit of a bother, service ueber professional, but cold. The Conrad Hotel is 'the other' Park Hyatt to me - i.e. stunning public areas and rooms, a great bar, great restaurants, a fab pool and location (with direct links to Shinbashi stations), but not over-crowded. Rooms: Large, great views, great bathroom and fantastic bed. Divine. Bar: Buzzing, but not overcrowded and not snobbish. Blue China and Ramsay restaurants: both have Michelin stars and it is clear why: sophisticated food in stylish surroundings. Breakfast: excellent buffet with separate menu for eggs (the way it should be). Pool and gym: Well designed, clean (ueber clean actually), attentive staff, not too busy. Relaxing. </DOC> The Conrad Tokyo is a rare combination of class, art and city living. With stunning design, exceptional views and a staff that caters to your every whim, there is no better place to stay. I was in Tokyo for a business trip and the amenities really helped me relax after work. The pool is especially exceptional with its views from the 29th floor. The concierge went out of his way to help plan my weekend and made me feel like i was in good hands. I will definitely stay here again on my next trip to Tokyo. </DOC> Rooms appear well used. Even though they are modern, they look like they have been knocked about. The Staff doesn't seem to be as well trained to give service as their other Conrad Asia counterparts. Children dominate the Executive Lounge. Perhaps it should be renamed Children's Playground with snacks instead of Executive Lounge. Staff of Executive Lounge are more interested in playing with the children than attending to the service of adult guests. Given the high price of hotel, it didn't meet standard. Even through I am a Hilton Diamond member, it is unlikely that I will return to this hotel on my next trip. </DOC> Stayed at this hotel for a couple of nights and had an exceptional experience. Hotel is located in the business district and is an easy walk to the Giza shopping area. Rooms are spacious and very well kept. Bathroom is a great size also. Bed was very comfortable and the view from my room was sensational. Would definitely recommend a stay at the Conrad Tokyo. </DOC> Always have a great time staying at Conrad Tokyo. Located at the Shiodome area and offering a great view of Tokyo Bay + Hamarikyu Garden, it also offers easy access to the famed Tsukiji Fish Market, Ginza shopping & entertainment belt. The staff at the Conrad Tokyo are impeccably well-trained, friendly and efficient, and they will bend backward to do many things for the hotel guests. The signature Japanese Conrad bear is a collector's dream ... In my many years of travel averaging more than 180 hotel nites a year, this is the hotel that sets the standard for the others to follow. </DOC> Once again the Conrad does not disappoint. A great introduction to Tokyo. Roomy bedroom and bathroom. Comfortable bed, drapes that opened electronically and adequate storage. The bathroom had both a shower and a separate bathtub. And of course a TOTO toilet bowl with a seat warmer. The service was over the top along with the friendliness of the staff. It didn't take very long for them to recognize you. The fitness center was well equipped. The breakfast buffet had a good variety of food very well prepared. The staff fully understands the concept of outstanding customer service and an experience that is unforgettable. </DOC> I stayed at the Conrad during a business meeting for 3 nights in July. The check in process is smooth and people were asking to take my bags from the moment I stepped out of the taxi. The hotel lobby is on the 28th floor of the building and the guesst rooms are on the higher floors. There is an outstanding bar in the lobby with views of the bay and skyline. Additionally, there is an amazing sushi restaurant on premises. The breakfast buffet was great with Japanese, Eastern, and Western choices. The guest rooms are spacious and the bathrooms are huge with tubs and separate rain showers. Two sinks and a high tech toilet. I would stay here again anytime I'm in Tokyo."
72,"Rooms with Amazing views.. Great Service Staff typical of Conrad service level. Nice room, nice Pool, and a lobby bar that have an amazing view of Tokyo Bay especially when you hang out from 5-8 and enjoy the sunset. Only thing I feel they could do better is the bed... Bed from Shangri la and Ritz Carlton are much more comfy.... Its not in a crowded part of Tokyo But easily reached from Haneda Airport (Took me 25 mins from the time I collected my luggage) 14 min Monorail + (7Mins taxi) Alternative is 14 mins Monorail + 1 train station + 5 mins walk (only if you have little luggage) </DOC> Pros: - Got upgraded to a suite - Clean and spacious room and bathroom with full amenities - Great vicinity to Ginza and direct access to the station Cons: - Power outlets aren't available in the usual spots, eg no power outlets next to the bed - No usb charger and no adaptor given - No free wifi (really? At this day and age, and at this type of hotel?) - Gym is quite small and gets overcrowded Overall, it was a great stay experience which was definitely helped by the free upgrade. Would come back to stay here. </DOC> What an amazing stopover. We were coming back from Taipei and decided to stop in Japan. Decided on the Conrad because of the location, quality, and reputation. It met all our needs and then some. The spa and gym are top notch and it's free! (well, I'm sure they built it in the price but it's nice not to pay extra). However, if you want to swim, there is a small charge. The hotel had great restaurants, but pricey. Then again, all of Japan is quite pricey. Great rooms and views </DOC> Stayed here for one night during short Tokyo trip in July 2014. Arrived at 12.45 (check in is at 15.00), and one day before asked for early check in via e-mail, which was promised but not guaranteed, but had no problem to check in at that early time. Greeted as HH Diamond and was informed that they upgraded me into nice suite, which was simply stunning, very large with amazing views, very clean and spacious, with stunning bathroom. Pool is also amazing, with incredible views, as is the breakfast, which is one of the best ones I ever had in a Hilton hotel. Absolutely worth the cost. </DOC> What an amazing and impressive hotel in the sky! From the moment you walk through the door, you are treated to amazing views, impeccable service, and all your cares are swept away. The staff are wonderful, pleasant, and seek to meet your every wish. Truly, you will not go wrong staying here. The rooms are well appointed with modern decor, comfortable huge bed, excellent pillows, and a fabulous spacious bathroom. The restaurants have fantastic foods, and the breakfast buffet will please everyone. And if you are able, get access to the executive lounge on the top floor. Taking a break there after a long travel day is the perfect way to rest your feet. </DOC> Fantastic Conrad property. High level of attention to every detail. Super oversized bathroom. Buffet breakfast is fantastic. Location is convenient given proximity to Shimbashi Station. Ginza is 10 minute leisurely walk away. Overall great stay- will be back. </DOC> The hotel occupies floors 28 to 34 of a highrise. Perfect location close to Subway and railway station. Only a few minutes walk to Ginza. Large, well appointed and luxurious rooms. Very friendly and helpful staff. Several excellent restaurants. The executive lounge serves the best breakfast of all of the many hotels I have been staying at all over the world. Great view from the lobby bar and lounge on the 28th floor. Highly recommended! </DOC> We visit annually and this hotel never fails to deliver an incredible stay. From the greeting at checkin to the helpful staff and the gorgeous suites it continues to deliver a consistently great stay. Their executive lounge has been expanded so there is plenty of seating during busy times. Naomi, the lounge manager, has been there for years and always gives us a warm welcome. The guest services team are all great and there for any of your needs. If you are a Diamond member you can take breakfast in the restaurant. They have a buffet and a menu you can also order from. It’s enough food to keep you satisfied to dinner. The views are incredible especially if you have a bay view room."
73,"Stayed here for three nights on business and thought it was top class - generous size room with very comfortable bed and ensuite bathroom which also shared in the views. The pool and gym areas also have great views of the cityscape and I found the service consistently good, in reception, the restaurants and in the executive lounge, which was a peaceful retreat. Would definitely return if I am in Tokyo again </DOC> I loved the Conrad. Spectacular lobby, great location near Shiodome metro station, gorgeous rooms, luxurious bathrooms, nice staff, etcetc. Beautiful pool. Would stay again in a heartbeat. My only complaint is, while I don't mind paying for a yoga class with an instructor (which was great to have on site), I don't think the hotel should charge $25/day for use of the swimming pool. In a hotel at this cost/level, I would assume use of the pool would be free. </DOC> Well it should be at the price it comes with. Rooms are spacious - really spacious, especially for Tokyo, with a king bed, two full size day beds back to back near the window, enormous bath etc. Staff is nice and location pretty decent (depends on where you have business but still pretty close to most central Tokyo business areas by cab) Breakfast is also decent but slow - they need to improve that, my toast was cold waiting for eggs and I left without my takeaway coffee. Overall, this is one of the nicest and biggest hotel rooms I’ve had without sacrificing a central Tokyo location. Nitpicks: - TV has almost nothing entertaining in English - Room service must cater more to vegetarians. There are a lot more of us and a cosmopolitan / luxury / business hotel must offer veg, kosher, halal and all kinds of other things </DOC> Great location with fantastic service. People were friendly and helpful. Executive lounge was very nice. Room was great and views of park were incredible. Train station within walking distance. Lots of shopping nearby. Good breakfast and dining options are very good. </DOC> This is an excellent hotel in Tokyo that is cited on floors 28 upwards of a tower block which immediately point to superb views. Location is good only 10 mins walk from a main subway link (underground through a shopping centre). Service is excellent as you would expect for this class of hotel. The rooms are very good, comfortable,roomy with a sizeable bathroom. Free WiFi adds to the picture. Even turn down service has an added extra on your first night. Dressing gowns and pyjamas are also provided. There are a number of restaurants (I have reviewed two separately). Would certainly pick this one again if we return to Tokyo. </DOC> We spent three nights at the Conrad. The hotel is conveniently located near the Shimbashi train station, Ginza, and Tsukiji Fish Market. All those locations are within walking distance for those who like to walk. Otherwise, you need to take a cab or subway to Ginza. Our room was clean, modern, comfortable, and spacious. Service was warm, attentive, and detailed-oriented. My only minor comment is that WiFi is only free if you are a Hilton member. At this price point, this seems a bit petty. Otherwise, WiFi was strong, steady, and reliable. Staff speaks English and we really appreciated their accommodation of a non-Japanese speaker (me). I would recommend the Conrad for any one. We had a great stay. </DOC> Hard to fault. I know a number of people who have stayed in Tokyo and all say that this is the best. Room prices change as the hotel gets fuller but you can get it for around $350 a night and as the Yen weakens it will get cheaper. Stayed there twice, prefer the cheaper rooms with city view as not keen on sun bursting through window straight in my eyes which you get in the bay view rooms! Hotel is well positioned near the underground system. Airport bus takes about an hour from the hotel. Best tip is to get clear instructions in Japanese back to the hotel when you go out as not many taxi drivers have heard of the place. Best room I have stayed in anywhere in the world for a business hotel! </DOC> Have stayed many of nights in some very good hotels in Tokyo. This was my first time at the Conrad. Definitely one of the top 5 in Tokyo. In a newer part of town, if you are comfortable taking the transit in Tokyo it is very convenient to the JR, subway, Bullet train and Monorail stations. Lobby on the 28th floor? Was not upgraded but had a city view King which was more than large enough. 1 floor down from Exec lounge, for breakfast a few hot items and a omelet station, very nice. The 2 nights I was able to make the evening cocktail hour the food was fine, one night it was appetizers from Gordon Ramsey and the other from the Chinese restaurant. Pool on the 29th floor is absolutely wonderful. Service was outstanding but you will pay for the privilege of staying here. Will stay again."
74,"It has been described widely here, so no need to rephrase all the good things. Maybe just to add about the service; every singe staff member seems to be unbelievably proud to work there, they are so naturally extensively happy to welcome you, to serve you that it makes it. You will be enchanted. Simple but works perfectly if every guests feels very much welcome. Walking distance to Ginza, nearby park was lovely during cherry blosssom, worth visiting, the monorail station to Odaiba is one level up, very convenient location. And airport limousine service also available. </DOC> I have to say this was one of the most luxurious and indulgent places I have stayed. Super comfy beds in a large room. Terrific bathroom with free standing bathtub and separated toilet and showers. The only downside to the hotel is access to it. If you're on the Skywalk, you have to escalator down a level, then elevator up to 28th floor for the hotel lobby, then walk across the lobby to get to your room. It isn't well thought out. Also signage from street level isn't great and a little tough to find if walking from the train station. Upside: Stunning views and the air is really pleasantly fragranced (and I do not like fragrances) </DOC> This is one of my favorite hotels in Tokyo. Great big rooms, very nice bathrooms a great small little lounge. Very good breakfast buffet and good food choices. Subway very close lots of restaurants and shopping very close. Great hotel! </DOC> What a great Hotel!! Excellent views, exceptional service and great restaurants make this a definite place to stay. We stayed here for three nights and loved every moment of our stay. The breakfast was amazing, both for the view and the great food. </DOC> This Hotel is beautifully appointed and our room was superb - pool area is great but pool is not heated. Before I complain please note one of my companions loved the breakfast buffet because of great salmon. I was appalled because they were in chaos - the buffet was out of eggs and juice and I wasn't offered the cooked egg menu until we were leaving for on the first day, second morning we ordered eggs Benedict in the room to avoid the chaos - THE WORST EVER - one solid congealed mess. The last morning tried the buffet again and ordered an omelette which took 10 minutes to arrive and when I cut into it yellowish water ran out - I left without eating breakfast. Also nothing gluten free. Beautiful Hotel but ghastly food. </DOC> A typical 5 star hotel in a Japanese setting. All is beautiful and stunning. Hotel rooms start at 29th floor so you have a good view over Tokyo. Rooms are big with a great bed and the nicest pillows, duvet and great mattress. The pillow case and duvet case were in the finest cotton material, so it was a bliss to sleep in there. The bathroom is stunning w the largest mirror and a nice bath tube. Everything you need to relax after a stressful day. And the rooms are so sound proof that I didn t hear any other guest or water running. I loved it. </DOC> Arrived around 8am and the hotel was kind enough to put me into a room straight away after a red eye with no charge. Really amazing to receive such flexibility. Hotel is well served by a multitude of transport options and is very modern, impeccably clean and maintained. Facilities are very good. Prices of in room dining / restaurants in the hotel as per any 5 star hotel in Tokyo are exorbitant. But in a city with so many dining options you really deserve to be punished if you don't leave the hotel! </DOC> Our stay at the Conrad Tokyo was nothing short of great. The hotel is well maintained and in a great location. The best part about the property was the included gym/pool/health center. My wife and I went to the steam rooms each day to relax. The only downfall of the property if that the executive lounge is not available to Hilton Gold members. The breakfast buffet benefit makes up for this drawback."
75,"An oasis of 5 star luxury in a frenetic city with great rooms and service. It feels a bit away from the buzz, it is, but in truth it's only 10 minutes walk from Ginza and on top of Shiodome subway station on the Ginza line. Great contemporary rooms with city view or bay view, latter is better but more pricey. Have stayed here twice and enjoyed both stays. The swimming pool, gym and spa on the 29th floor are fantastic, I couldn't resist daily visits to relax after a day in the city. After the Hortholme Hilton on Mahe in the Seychelles this is without doubt the best Hilton I have ever been to. </DOC> Beautiful hotel with very friendly staff who had good english and totally helpful. Huge rooms with massive bathroom. Very quiet and dark rooms with lovely views over Tokyo. Breakfast buffet good selection of hot and cold foods. All staff and service excellent. Great location. The Cerise restaurant very nice with great staff and food. </DOC> Despite being an express train, local connection and seven minute walk to get to the hotel from Narita upon arrival it was worth the wait. The lobby is awesome as you enter on the 28th floor their is soaring cityscapes and some live music in the lobby bar, nice touch. We were pleasantly suprised by how comfortable the bed was and how well designed the bathrooms were. Did I mention the touch of the rubber duck in the tub..again nice touch. We had great service from the staff and especially the concierge on many occassions during our stay. We will definitely come back to this hotel! </DOC> You pay a premium but like all things Conrad it’s worth it. Service on point; common areas are great; lobby restaurants are great and the staff really do a good job with room service and remembering your personal preferences Highly recommend particularly in this location which also has expansive Tokyo Bay views </DOC> Stayed there for 5 nights, service was good in general and polite staff. However something can be improved, the breakfast venue was very busy and crowded during Saturday and Sunday. There was 1 day that housekeeping did not refill the amenities and another day I found short hair in the bathtub. </DOC> Maybe a completely quiet room in Tokyo is not possible. Ours ( on the 37th floor) was mostly quiet but would occasionally rumble - maybe from trains, maybe from rooftop generators? It's overall an excellent hotel In terms of location and value for money. There's often a queue for breakfast but we usually waited less than 5 minutes. Airport coach is convenient and good value. </DOC> Just the most beautiful hotel, with the best service. Rooms are very modern. Bathrooms are amazing. Can't want to visit again. Location is not the greatest, but close to many options for great food. I stayed on the executive floor, and the lounge was the best I've ever seen. </DOC> Yet again Conrad hotels do not disappoint with great service and amenities. As per last reviews I am a diamond member of the Hilton honors program and they upgraded us to the executive floor with access to the lounge. The employees, room and amenities were all fantastic at this hotel. The hotel was well placed for us with easy access to both the JR lines and the subway lines so it was an easy out to wherever we wanted to go. We landed at haneda airport, which is about $70 in a cab if you want to take one but also easy train travel trip with help from the ladies at the station. Most helpful trip advise we got was buy a suico card for the metro - this gets you everywhere on the trains and before leaving hand it back to get your deposit back - all very easy."
76,"I love this hotel. Location, Rooms, Staff!! The concierge were exceptional. Very professional yet helpful, patient who gave fantastic tips, directions, recommendations. It was my first time and I was with two young kids and never got lost in the maze of a subway due to the concierge's directions. It's very comfortable and plush. And if you have young kids, the room is very spacious. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. </DOC> I have stayed at this hotel 4 times in the past year and the consistency of service, cleanliness and overall feel of the hotel is excellent. It has a great Exec lounge for gold card holders which serves a great breakfast, a great gym with a pool and has a few choices of restaurants. Additionally it is in a great locatiin where there are plenty other options close by. I highly recommend this hotel! </DOC> Our family stayed in a Tokyo Bay facing suite and had a wonderful stay over the busy New Year holiday period. The suite was relatively small (compared to others in Tokyo that we had stayed - e.g. Grand Hyatt and Peninsula) but was completely adequate, well equipped and spotlessly maintained. Service was top-notch - e.g. room service accommodated our customised request for meals for our kids - and always provided with a smile. The executive lounge was perennially busy but the staff capably managed this and made sure every guest felt welcome and looked after. Great experience and would recommend this to anyone looking for a top luxury hotel in the Ginza area. </DOC> During my twelve night stay I was extremely delighted with the warm welcome I received every time entering the hotel. Great spacious and luxurious rooms, very friendly staff and great service. A very warm ambiance makes you feel at home although you are actually far away I can only highly recommend </DOC> Husband and I stayed 5 nights. The room really had the wow factor. It was very spacious and well thought out. The furniture, although you could see some wear and tear, ages well, like museum pieces. The bathroom is a dream. The bed was a little too hard for my taste (my problem in many hotels) but it had just dreamy linens. We had breakfast and evening drinks in the lounge (delicious canapes). The service was excellent. I would love to come back to the Conrad someday. </DOC> One of the finest stay under Conrad brand. Thank you Ari Suzuki and team for looking after us. Well appointed room with welcome amenities and hand written card. We only stayed here for a night which didn't give us much time to eplore the area and the hotel. Will return soon......once again Thank You Conrad Tokyo. </DOC> We visited this bar for bar drinks only and it was really very nice-staff friendly and helpfull,excellent view to skysccapers around,very wide range of drinks on bar,high attention guy with perfect reccomendation to japanese whisky etc! </DOC> The ambience and staff all smack of 5 stars. The rooms are luxurious. King sized bed in a large room with picture window overlooking the bay. Staff are numerous and keen to arrange anything they can to make your stay perfect. Lovely bar on 28th floor with picture windows. Restaurants are varied. Prices can be a shock if you are not accustomed to Japan! A bowl of soup and a sandwich delivered to your room can be US $60. Connected by underground passageway to the subway and railways. Well positioned within walking distance of the Fish Market and the Ginza and easy subway connection to main museums."
77,"Currently staying at the Conrad for a week. Have got a bay view executive room. Room is spacious (48m2) with superb views over Hamarikyu park and Tokyo harbour. I woke this morning at about 5:00am (still jet lagged) and have spent the last hour taking in the view hardly able to believe how lucky I am to enjoy it. Definitely worth a little bit extra for bay view rather than city view rooms. Exec lounge does breakfast, afternoon teas as well as evening drinks and nibbles. A range of restaurants in the hotel and plenty of nearby cheaper ones if desired. Service and attentiveness of staff throughout hotel has been impeccable. </DOC> This property is located in a perfect location. Not exactly downtown but more like a financial hub.The subway is located right next door which is a huge plus. It's walking distance to many central areas too. The rooms are gorgeous and good sized. Bathrooms are very nicely designed. The breakfast restaurant can get overly crowded between 8-10 am so plan accordingly. Great tourist or business hotel. Very impressed. </DOC> Stayed for 3 nights in a Bay view suite (got bumped from bay view exec on arrival which was a bonus!) - loved the modern room with great views. Overall service was excellent - loved the large bar with high ceilings. The exec lounge offered a good (although not great) spread again with nice scenic city views at nights. Didn't eat at any of the restaurants for dinner so cannot comment - breakfast was good although could have done with a fresh egg offering.Liked the location as easy walk into Ginza and v convenient for all forms of public transport. Definitely to be recommended. </DOC> We had a 1 night stay here on the last leg of our holiday. We were upgraded to a city view room on the 36th floor. The view, and the room in general, were magnificent. The bathroom was spacious, cleverly laid out and provided with excellent toiletries. Even more impressive than the room was the service. During our stay I realised that I had forgotten a bag at Tokyo station. The staff at the concierge desk were most helpful in contacting the station and locating my bag, which I was able to collect before flying home. We had a drink in the bar in the evening: they were expensive but worth it for the view and ambience. We didn't get a chance to try the gym. Maybe next time:-) </DOC> This is a fantastic business hotel, very large and top rooms. Great services. Lobby lounge has a lovely view and nice area to sit. The breakfast is good with a fair selection, also here great service. It is walking distance from Ginza. The only little downside is, it isn't Really a family getaway type of place. Most guest are there for business and the hotel and rooms are catering for that. Two stations are in close proximity and so are some restaurants. No good supermarkets as far as I could tell (Starbucks and Family Mart are next door). </DOC> This property has amazing décor, ambiance and location. Everything is luxe, probably the best Conrad property. I would stay again. Service excellent, food incredible, comfort unbeatable. I recommend it for Tokyo. </DOC> The hotel is in ideal location and only a short taxi ride away from the major Tokyo subway station or right next to the Shidome station. You can walk 15 minutes and you are in the Ginza shopping district or 10 minutes in the opposite direction, you are in the famous fish market. The rooms are completely modern, ultra clean, quiet and great views over the city or the Hama-rikyu Gardens right next door. Could not ask for a better location. We booked a room on the executive floor (37) and the service, food, drink, etc, in the executive lounge is spectacular. It can get a little crowded, but the experience is 5 star. Excellent gym and indoor swimming pool - could not ask for anything better for a hotel in Tokyo. We are not looking forward to leaving this hotel and travelling to the next city on our vacation trip. </DOC> Loved the Conrad Tokyo since staying here with my kids 5 years ago, so I was eager to return with my fiancé. Still the same beautiful, luxurious hotel I remember, with service better than ever. Conveniently located to a couple of train stations, so despite its office building neighborhood you can still easily get to the major sights of Tokyo. Made it to the park across the street this time, and it was beautiful. Management should really do more to promote guests taking advantage of that natural asset. And I was very pleased to see they eliminated the one complaint I had from last visit, when smoking was allowed in the lobby bar and it was the first thing you smelled off the elevator on the 28th floor. Now it's pure luxury and service from top to bottom. Breakfast buffet as a Gold member was great too. Can't go wrong staying here; we will be back."
78,"We spent a week in Tokyo in November splitting our time between the Conrad & the venerable Park Hyatt. Much to my surprise the Conrad won hands down. From the moment we arrived the service was fantastic and the hotel itself is really element and suave. It has everything you could want in terms of amenities and unlike Park Hyatt, they don't charge you extra to use the spa. The service was attentive and friendly and the food was terrific at breakfast too. Location wise you're close to Ginza and there are a choice of trains right on the doorstep of the hotel for easy reach to explore Tokyo further. I'd definitely stay at the Conrad if I ever return to Tokyo. It's everything you would expect from a top class 5 star hotel. </DOC> I had a fantastic stay at this beautiful hotel in Tokyo. The staff was very friendly and the rooms were nice. It is stunning and the decor and view are what makes it great. I would have loved to give the hotel a 5 star but it was just short. We called for a bellman and it took three calls and 20 minutes of waiting. This was in the afternoon. Also, I stayed for 2 nights and I returned from my day at 4 PM and my room had not been made up by Housekeeping. This is not 5 star service on that level. Otherwise, book it. Its awesome. </DOC> Upon arrival I asked for a room with a nice view and when I got to my room I was very disappointed that I was directly facing another tall building. I called to the front desk and although it took a little time, they moved me into another room with a wonderful view of the park and harbor. I was so happy not to be in a depressing room all week. The location of the hotel itself is really close to shopping and our business in the area. The gym is small but adequate and you can have 24 hour access. Food at the restaurant was very good quality. Yes, I would stay again. </DOC> This is absolutely the best hotel I've stayed in on my multiple trips to Tokyo. The rooms are fantastic, the overall hotel is great and the views can't be beat. Service is impeccable and I love the location. It's in the large Shiodome complex with good access to rail lines. </DOC> Great location, amazing facilities and service, big clean rooms and a brilliant view. I would definitely stay here again. The hotel and its rooms are very modern and the spa and pool is a great added benefit. </DOC> It doesn't get much better than this in a big city. Located right on the edge of Ginza with a train and metro station right on the doorstep. Rooms are big, much bigger than like rooms in Tokyo. Staff were great, nothing too much trouble, the children especially liked the fun bottles of water they were given when going out for the day in the shape of hello kitty and the bullet train! The restaurants were expensive, but hey this is Tokyo and everything is expensive. The only disappointment was the set menu in the Ramsey lounge didnt change during our 4 day stay, we would have been more tempted to eat here again had it changed nightly. Overall an exceptional hotel in the heart of Tokyo </DOC> I truly enjoyed staying at Conrad. Our room was spacious and had a great view of the Tokyo Bay. It had a comfortable day bed all along the window. It also had a large bath tub and all the comfort you'd expect from a high-end Conrad hotel. The only drawbak is it's a bit walk from subway station, but the hotel is connected through the underground path and you do not need to go outside. There are two subway stops - Shiodome and Shimbashi - Shimbashi is extremely convenient to get to anywhere in Tokyo. It's also located within 10 minute walk from the Tsukiji fish market if you enjoy having sushi breakfast there. This is one of the best hotels I stayed at in Tokyo. </DOC> The Conrad is an oasis of tranquillity in a high energy city. Twenty eight floors above street level, you are immune from street noise and mayhem. So relaxing to have a drink or coffee in the bar, with a 'wide screen' view of the City and Bay. Breakfast excellent with extensive choice of food. We had evening meal in the restaurant twice-- excellent both times, with food served at a European pace, rather than the next course arriving whilst halfway through the previous one--( the Japanese somehow think this represents efficiency, whilst we think food is to be enjoyed-- not a race!) Conveniently located in the Shiodome Complex, close to Shimbashi station and 30 min walk to Ginza."
79,"Superb service, large rooms, extremely quiet, very clean, and excellent executive lounge. </DOC> Had the privilege of staying in two different suites on my last stay. As usual, the Conrad was excellent. Service was great, friendly and the concierge was very helpful making difficult reservations. Our first suite was a King Bay View suite. It was huge and roomy with a large king bed, a small half bathroom, huge walk-in closet and a roomy bathroom. Our second suite was a twin city view suite. It was roomy but about 1/2 the size of the king suite. It did not have a half bathroom. We had no issues with our stay. The hotel is very well maintained, comfortable and I personally like the location (10 minute walk to Ginza and close to several subway lines). Very pleasant stay. </DOC> Nice hotel in a good location for walking to Japanese garden and seeing the water! As a Hilton diamond member we got to check in at the executive floor lounge. Room not upgraded and we had a view of a building. Nice room that was clean and efficient. Executive floor was nice with great cocktail hour and an ok breakfast. Small area for breakfast buffet. Alex who just started working there was nice to talk to. Cocktails in lobby lounge ridiculously priced $23.00 for a very weak drink, pretty views but not worth the prices. Hotel a little formal and stuffy. Not sure I would stay here again. </DOC> This is the fifth time that we have stayed at the Conrad in Tokyo. The rooms are spacious. The Staff is very very helpfull. The location is unmatched due to the underground pathways to the Metro and Rail lines. </DOC> We have stayed in the Conrad Tokyo a number of times. Unlike other hotels where our initial experience was fantastic and then when we came back we were disappointed, the Conrad never disappoints. In fact it gets better and better. The staff is superb! The food in the hotel is excellent. The convenience of the bus connection from the airport and the availability of the train station and subway station make it very easy to get around. One can walk to the Ginza easily. </DOC> Very friendly and professional staff. Rooms were very luxurious and well thought out. Was just there for one night but was very impressed by the entire hotel. Ate dinner in their all day dining where the food was just ok but service great. Was surprised that the dining room sits right beside the walkway to guest elevators which made for a noisy dinner as the walls are open. That would be my only complaint and prevent me from eating there again. </DOC> Beautiful hotel and exactly what you expect from a 5 Star property. Hotel staff and all the people of Japan were very kind. Very close to subway and jr station. Try the pool and spa. Great views. We had a city view room which was nice. The bay views are probably preferable. </DOC> This is one of the few hotels where my family is making it a point to get back. From the moment we checked in, the staff made us feel extremely welcome. The service was backed up with amazing amenities from the rooms to the lounge. Every aspect of this stay was superb. Even the location, attached to the Shiodome allowed for us to travel via trains and see the city with ease. Also, this was one of the best hotel breakfasts from any of the hotels which I have visited."
80,"Like many of the hotels in the major cities in Japan, this hotel is situated on the top floors of an office building. The views from the hotel windows provide a panorama of the city area, the Hama-Rikyu Gardens or the Sumida River and Tokyo Bay. The food in the restaurants is superb, but expect to pay top dollar, even for a coffee in the bar. The staff and service were exceptional, nothing was too much trouble and everything happened very smoothly. Our room was very nicely appointed, with excellent blackout blinds (handy when you need a sleep after a long flight). The bathroom contained a full selection of toiletries. Free wifi is available in the public spaces within the hotel. A fantastic hotel, but costs are high. </DOC> We truly loved our stay at Conrad Hotel Minato Tokyo, Service is superb, inroom dining is yummy-pricey though. Their suite is luxurious from the beds, sheets, and bathroom that had water proof tv by the tub. From the lobby to the hallway, everything seems luxurious. Their concierge though are not so friendly but its ok, didnt need much from them. Taking the subway is very accessible cause once you get down the hotel, theres an access to the subway station and leads to all stations you want. I have to say, Conrad Hotel is an Excellent Hotel! </DOC> We spent 4 nights at the Conrad and enjoyed every moment. The breakfast buffet was excellent and started our day in the best way. We loved our suite (room 3145) that overlooked the harbor and park below. The Conrad is right above a very nice subway station and it was easy to maneuver our way around this very large city. Very comfortable bed and luxurious bathroom...very well appointed </DOC> My DH, DD, and I stayed at this hotel for six nights during our trip to Japan. Location is unbeatable with metro/trains right at your doorstep (even the Shinkansen). Service is excellent. Nothing was too much to ask. We had a bay view room; it truly was worth the extra cost. Rooms are quite spacious and nicely decorated. Housekeeping was unobtrusive yet highly efficient. I found the service in the Executive Lounge beyond all reproach. The lounge itself is small but it feels clubby and intimate. Food was varied and very good. We ate at China Blue (excellent and gorgeous views). This restaurant also serves overflow from Exec Lounge during breakfast hours. We ate there once just to experience it, but we preferred the atmosphere of the lounge despite the unbeatable views. We would definitely stay here again. </DOC> For sure not the best hotel in Tokyo, but they do come close. The staff are the best part of the hotel, they make sure they go out of their way to ensure you a memorable stay. The rooms are nice, pretty big but the way the room is divided is not the best, the entrance area is too narrow, you cant walk past it if the closet door is open. The bathroom is very nice, huge round lit mirror as well. The bay view rooms are the best, make sure to take rooms in the centre of each floor to have a good view, the higher the better for sure. The internet is free, the gym is nice with a good choice of equipment and a nice indoor pool. Location was great for my business meetings. The breakfast is good as well, both Japanese and international options. </DOC> Just stayed here for 3 nights in late March.. we could have stayed here forever as the views, the bathrooms, the beds, the amenities, and the decor are perfect ! That said, we had access to the conceirge / executive level with breakfast and evening snacks (we also had free internet as a Hilton platinum member). Without that, the rating might not be as high because the restaurant prices are outrageous and the bar menu did not seem exciting or worth the prices. The lobby and bar area also frequently smelled of smoke (not too uncommon in Japan). As far as the rooms go, they are among the top 10 I have ever stayed in during my 25 years of travel for both business and pleasure.. We will definitely go back if the chance arises ! </DOC> Well located hotel in the heart of Ginza, within walking distance from two train stations, and with spectacular views from the lobby and rooms. Service is outstanding, as generally the case in Japan. We booked a twin room and were able to stay there as family of 2 adults and 2 kids - this is a big plus. </DOC> The Conrad Tokyo is one of those rare hotels that approaches perfection. From the minute you drive up to the entrance, the service is terrific. very one of the staff was friendly and helpful. Registration was fast, efficient and welcoming. The HHONORS lounge is one of the best I've experienced. The rooms are spacious and very well appointed. I cannot imagine a better hotel experience in Tokyo!"
81,"Very elegant and beautiful hotel.Overlooking nature at its best as a japaneses park.Nice spacious rooms,very good service and nice restaurants.Breakfast was complimentary as a hilton Gold member and it was quite nice with a lot of variety.Walking distance to shopping street of GInza as well some nice restaurants. </DOC> Brilliant location, spacious room and excellent service. We had after a long journey dinner in the Japanese restaurant and it did not disappoint. Breakfast had a very good choice of western and Japanese tastes with a cheerful and efficient staff. Pricey, but worth it. </DOC> We had the pleasure of staying at both the Conrad and the Park Hyatt Tokyo in October 2014. The Conrad starts with a lobby and lounge on the 28th floor with a magnificent view of Tokyo Bay. We were greeted by Ari :-). The room we got on the 34th floor was spacious, luxurious, very modern, electric shades to the outside and between the glass wall between the bath and and the room. The fitness center was excellent and overlooked the pool on the 29th floor, which itself was amazing as it overlooked the city. outstanding hotel! I will post a separate review of the Park Hyatt, but the bottom line is that both are outstanding and the choice of where to stay hinges on what Tokyo neighborhood you want to be in. </DOC> This is an amazing hotel. the lobby is large and opened planned. reception is on the 28th Floor with a great view of the skyline and Harbour. The room was very pleasant, the bathroom large and well stocked. We had a great view of the harbour, the staff are amazing and cant do enough for you. Breakfast was one of the best I have had in a hotel in a long while, Defo stay here again </DOC> Jetsetter had a mystery hotel deal happening right around Fall of 2012 and it wasn't hard to figure out it was the Conrad. Great hotel. Rooms were huge. Bathroom was awesome. Breakfast was comped and very decent selection. Great service. Concierge was very helpful in setting up a surprise bday cake for the gf. They were even more helpful making some difficult restaurant reservations in the city. In terms of getting around via subway, it's not in the most convenient location. Shiodome is right outside the hotel but you need to transfer lines to get anywhere interesting. Tsukiji is within walking distance. Ginza is walkable too but really would just recommend just cabbing it. </DOC> Hard to criticize anything about the Conrad. Rooms are marvelous. Great decor, wonderful bathroom with separate tub, and beds that out of this world. Light system easy to figure out. Breakfast in the Executive Lounge is great. Spend a little more and stay on the water-side of the hotel. View is spectacular. The only strange thing I’d point to is how long check-in and check-out takes. It’s because of the computer system. Must be DOS-based! </DOC> Stayed at the Conrad Tokyo for 2 nights. It is a nice luxurious business oriented hotel. The location is in the hart of Tokyo's business district. This Hotel is connected to Tokyo Metro's E line (Shimbashi Station). It is Also 10 minutes driving distance from Tokyo Station where you could get access to JR network such as the Narita Express or the Shinkansen network. The hotel staff in general were nice and the concierge were very useful. </DOC> Tokyo hospitality + Conrad standard = great result. While I was not particularly fond of the exact location (just south of the Ginza district), the location was walkable to metro and JR rail lines. The hotel staff were (as expected) awesome. They were genuinely concerned with making my stay great, yet they were not overbearing. The room was also fantastic -- large for Tokyo standards and the high ceilings were a nice touch. The Executive lounge was nice, and the breakfast buffet in the lobby area restaurant was fantastic. I can't wait to come back!"
82,"Entering via a bell desk on the ground (first) floor you then scoot up to the 28th floor reception where the friendly staff efficiently checks one in. We were lucky to be upgraded to a suite. The Hotel is beautifully decorated and the rooms are very attractive with good views, comfortable beds, super bathrooms with a separate toilet. The breakfast was special and offered a reasonable variety. A very good choice close to the public transport system yet a little removed from the extremely busy centre . One of the most beautiful hotels we have stayed in and almost clinically clean. </DOC> This was in the too five hotels we've stayed with over many decades. The service and attention to detail was flawless. The rooms were well equipped, super clean and serviced perfectly. The staff anticipate your every need, insist on helping with every element of your stat. The concierge were all knowledgeable and each time went the extra mile. I've rarely experienced a better staff or a better stay. It's on the shiodome subway line which is not the best, but if you are ready to walk about ten minutes or so, underground, you get to the much more significant Shimbashi station. Great stay. </DOC> We had an amazing stay in this hotel ,it truly is 5stars in every way - the staff are there to help you wherever you go,always with a smile -the rooms are large,clean and with everything you need - We had breakfast in the executive lounge ,and it had a very good atmosphere both for breakfast and evening cocktails - The hotel is within easy access to trains and metro,and I recommend to use an hour or two in the lovely park close to the hotel - you can also visit a nice tea house in the park I highly recommend Conrad Tokyo </DOC> As many reviews have stated the rooms and service are great. Wanted to comment on brand new Collage restaurant that has replaced Gordon Ramsay at Conrad restaurant. Collage has all new interior done in chrome, mirrors and leather. But not tacky or too retro feeling. More very sophisticated and makes the room very open. The food is fantastic and the chef, chef Maeda, is a great talent. He blends Asian and western flavors together. Three different set menus give you a choice of selections. The dishes are presented on very contrasting plates that really highlight the dishes' colours. We went on opening night and were not dissappointed. Collage will become one of the top restaurants in Tokyo and can be expected to earn several Michelin stars. </DOC> This ia afabulous hotel. It is new and hotel with a great location. It is very expensive however. I stayed using Hilton points but would have paid close to $500 a night for the Executive room I received. I would advise, however, if you are planning to stay in the hotel you may want to consider the addition $75 or so for an executive level room. The executive lounge offers free breakfast (very good--smoked salmon, omelets, fruit), free non-alcoholic drinks all day, free snacks all day, free alcohol from 5-7pm, and free evening appetizers. We never had to eat breakfast or dinner which saved quite a bit of money. </DOC> Great location. Service really nice but some puzzling aspects. There is no place to just sit in the main floor and relax. One afternoon I was just sitting by the window admiring the view and the hostess told me it was reserved and I had to move. The whole place was mostly empty too. This is a deluxe hotel. </DOC> Although I had hoped to spend time sightseeing in Tokyo before heading to Kyoto, Typhoon Lan interfered with my plans. Fortunately, I was staying in one of the world's truly great hotels. Everyone I met at the hotel was pleasant and professional and appeared eager to assist with a guest's needs. As a diamond member, I received an room upgrade to a room with a great view after the rain subsided. Since going outside wasn't an attractive option, I spent a lot of time in the lounge. The options for breakfast, afternoon snacks, and evening happy hour were all excellent. Although I missed breakfast one morning due to my belief that it ended later, the lounge manager without being asked ordered food from the restaurant for me. </DOC> This hotel was absolutely beautiful and smelled amazing too.... the hotel lobby was located on a higher floor (don't remember which floor exactly) with great views of the city and water. If you love shopping, the Ginza district was not far away! 10 min walk from the hotel where you'll find tons of high end shops and amazing dining options too. Lambert helped out my girlfriend and I from check in to check out! He was truly amazing... he got us a fantastic room with amazing views and pointed out where to go and what to do on a map he created for us. Extremely nice gentleman! One thing you must visit in this hotel is the pool... jaw dropping lap pool! It was so amazing.... thank you Conrad Tokyo we will be back!!!"
83,"This was my first revisit in perhaps 4 years and a very pleasant surprise. extremely courteous check in and overall service, even by the high standards in Japan matched by high quality rooms.Although somewhat out of the way from Ginza, the proximity to the monorail connection to Haneda airport makes up for it. </DOC> Lovely design, Good location as it is close to a subway station, remarkable harbour view from the room, great sleep quality It is a great hotel though if you want to experience Japanese hospitality, you don't see a bit here. This is more like American style service. Everything is good but I expect the same level of Japanese hospitality as other big hotels have. Breakfast is more like western style with limited choices, </DOC> This hotel is not exactly in the center of town but everything else overcomes the slight inconvenience of not being there. The hotel staff are slick and obviously know their business. The concierge is knowledgeable and probably one of the best I have ever come across in my years of travelling. The room and bathroom are spacious and well appointed. The Aromatherapy Associates amenities in the bathroom have my vote despite being made in China. The breakfast is all-encompassing with a full buffet as well as an à la cattle menu ranging from Asian to Western, all beautifully presented. Ask for a room overlooking the bay as it is a wonderful view and well worth the extra. The Conrad is not cheap, compared to other hotels in the same category, but it is worth paying the extra for the impeccable service and the lovely rooms. </DOC> Top business hotel with all amenities you can ask for. Warm and dedicated staff who care about your well- being. Lovely indoor-hotel restaurants and super close to all exciting shops and malls nearby in Gaiza district. One of the best concierge desks I have encountered on my business trips worldwide and superior business center with knowledgeable staff. Extraordinary club level offerings Highly recommended for the business traveller! </DOC> I only had a short stay at the Conrad. We arrived late and had an early flight out of Haneda. Our reception was excellent - the front desk staff was very efficient. My room was a beautiful 2 room suite with a great view. The bed was incredibly comfortable. The bathroom was amazing with a large bath and shower in the same glass cubicle. The sitting area was very comfortable. The hotel is well situated in a park-like area. I was particularly impressed that when we checked out early the next morning, the front desk staff met us with snack boxes. I would definitely return to the Conrad. </DOC> Our travel agent booked this hotel and we had no idea what to expect. This was our last hotel on our 21 day trip in Japan and stayed for 5 nights. Our room was on the 31st floor with a view of the Tokyo Bay. It was breathtaking. The guest room was beautifully appointed and luxurious. The breakfast buffet was everything we could possibly want and more. The staff at breakfast were constantly making sure we had everything we wanted or needed. The front desk staff were always checking with us to be sure we were ok and asking if they could help in anyway. We were absolutely spoiled and did not want to leave. What a wonderful experience. </DOC> This hotel is not inexpensive, but it won't bend your credit card, like one or two others I've stayed in which do not deliver what you will consistently get at The Conrad. Service is unfalteringly good, choice and standard of restaurants means you can entertain clients unhesitatingly, over sized rooms and well appointed, and if you are on the Tokyo Bay side, you will be won over by the view, day or night. All in all a very high class experience. </DOC> Well located to Ginza shops and restaurants this hotel offers a very high standard of accommodation and facilities. Striking views over Tokyo Bay and gardens below from the 28th floor bar and restaurants will not fail to impress. All staff are attentive and helpful and it most certainly ranks amongst the best in Tokyo which is experiencing a tourist boom from just about everywhere in the world right now. One or two examples of furniture looking tired and worn are beginning to show through which management need to keep an eye on in order to stay close to the top of the tree."
84,"First time I've stayed here after being recommended by friends. Extremely satisfied with all aspects and would definitely stay here again. Staff are particularly attentive, and the view from lounge bar is striking </DOC> Stayed here for our final few days in Japan following a two week tour and thoroughly enjoyed this hotel. With a metro station literally outside the door, it is great for accessing all that Tokyo had to offer. We stayed on the 37th floor and found the rooms to be excellent and spacious with high quality toiletries etc. slight criticism was the non enforcement of the ""no phones in the exec lounge"". Its not a big lounge so booming voices on that ""vital call"" travel very easily! We couldn't understand why the hotel has decided to have the lounge facing the tower blocks when there is a beautiful view of the bay on the other side.. Commercial decision maybe. The bar on the lower floors makes beautiful cocktails and the breakfast has almost everything you could wish for. Overall a good choice for business or pleasure. </DOC> This hotel is very nice and is on the top floors of an office building. Try to get the bay view side which is a much nicer view than tall buildings. Hotel staff is excellent and the food in the club room is excellent too. Our suite was very nice though the hotel is starting to show a little wear from when we were here about four years ago---time for the hotel to look at replacing some furniture, carpet, etc. </DOC> Very large and beautiful rooms, especially by Tokyo standards. The hotel is not in a particularly great location though, among a series of buildings and highways. The metro station nearest to the hotel is not on the main, most convenient lines either. Also, use of the pool is extra... which is ridiculous given the room prices charged. Probably more of a business hotel for business people with their own means of transportation. </DOC> For years we rated the New Otani , Tokyo best hotel in world. Then a few years ago we enjoyed the Conrad Hong Kong which is superlative. Now we can add the Conrad Tokyo, it is better than New Otani because of spectacular views of Tokyo Bay from bedrooms, which are larger and more modern, with outstanding bathrooms. The Diamond Executive Lounge on Floor 37 Lounge completes the contest with wonderful service from check in to check out. Luxury. Near Fish Market and grand garden. </DOC> The rooms are very well appointed and large in size. However the two step process of getting to your room is a bit annoying (elevators take you to the 28th floor) and then you walk to another bank of elevators to get to your room). The breakfast buffet was large but not as much variety for a western pallet as I expected. Service is exceptional everywhere except the bar/lounge. </DOC> Walking from Shimbashi station, it was difficult to find. Entrance had such a small sign that I had to walk around. Possibly the hotel expects everyone arrives by cars. Event halls are completely separated from hotel itself and located on ground level whilst hotel rooms are on higher levels. I was not impressed by hotel staff or service although it is supposed to be an expensive good hotel. </DOC> Hotel is great in terms of location, comfort and furnishings, and so is service. But there is no free internet access either by LAN cable or wifi, which is unusual for Japan, and that is a big disappointment for me."
85,"Pros Insane room with view, bathroom, tub. Super impressive. Insane pool on top floors with mens lockers, tubs. Near the Shiodome MRT, Ginsa district. Beautiful garden and ferry just across the street. Nice attentive staff Excellent bar with view Cons Some limited English Ramsey restaurant was empty. My top 3 hotel. I'm Conrad for life! </DOC> The Conrad Tokyo provides luxurious accommodations and outstanding service. The location is great, with quick access to Ginza. The hotel sits atop an office complex so that all the rooms have an outstanding view of the city and Tokyo Bay. The layout is very modern without some of the edgy chic that is seen increasingly often. The controls for lights, window shades and drapes, as well as entertainment are all remotely controlled from the bed. The bathroom has all of the expected amenities, as well as the quintessentially Japanese heated commode seat. </DOC> We stayed twice during our Japan trip, in between side trips. We really looked forward to returning at the end of our tour. The staff is extremely helpful and considerate. The advice we received and the attention to customer service was excellent. We had a room over looking the bay and Hamarikyu Garden - absolutely beautiful view. Pick up a bottle of wine and watch the lights of Tokyo Bay from your room before dinner! The underground passages between the Shiodome and Shinbashi (Shimbashi JR) stations may at first seem intimidating (especially during rush hour!) but once you figure it out the access to subway and JR is easy and convenient. The rooms and very clean, turn down service is welcome after dinner, and the blackout curtains really work making for a great night sleep. This is one of my favorite Hilton family hotels in the world. Will definitely stay again. </DOC> Stayed for 2nd time at this beautiful hotel. As usual staff are friendly and helpful. Main difference for this stay is that the executive lounge has shifted to the 28th floor behind the reception and it's temporary as they are expanding the original one. Only sparkling wine is served there and no champagne. I felt that the quality of the food could be improved. I stayed in the city view room this time and certainly the view of the Tokyo bay is way better. Maybe worth paying the extra for that view. Otherwise hotel is very convenient to travel to the different sites of interests. I highly recommend the gardens in front of the hotel. The Sakura is already starting to bloom! The garden is called Hamarikyu gardens. </DOC> The hotel is located near the yurikamome line shiodome station which is one stop away from Shimbashi Station. Pretty close to the Haneda Int'l Airport. The room I stayed was at level 33 of the hotel, had a breathtaking aerial view of Tokyo. The staff were courteous and helpful, the breakfast was great. Tried the 28 Bar and had a wonderful time. The staff were so helpful and went the distance to find me some chargers for my mobile phones and my MacBook. Was really impressed. Overall, nice room, nice view, nice staff, strategical location very near to Marunouchi business district. </DOC> Very modern, well appointed, the staff go out of their way to assist and answer any questions or requests, the rooms are large and comfortable, and the location is within a ten minute walk to Ginza. We only ate at the hotel for breakfast and the buffet was very nice and had a extensive selection of foods. All the restaurants in the hotel are very pricey, and so is the hotel. The Conrad is what you would expect form a luxury hotel in a modern city like Tokyo. </DOC> I've stayed here a few times and everytime I feel like i'm returning home. The staff is so friendly, the rooms are so tastefull. The train station is right underneath the hotel. Entering the Hotel is like diving in the warm ocean. </DOC> Our room on 37th floor with great view over Tokyo Bay. We did not like glass wall to bathroom. Toilet was an old Toto that really does need upgrading. I was also disappointed no Nespresso machine for the price we are paying ( very expensive spending Australian dollars. The staff are all excellent and very helpful. Good range of restaurants but very expensive"
86,"Super luxury hotel in a good location with easy access both on foot and public transport using nearby Shiodome station. Amazing views from the Bay-facing rooms on the higher floors - we loved the seats in front of the windows looking out over Hamarikyu Gardens and beyond. Staff was very professional and breakfast in the lounge was splendid. Special call-out to Ida at reception who was brilliant and helped us resolve a problem with a hotel we would be visiting later in our trip (as they didn't speak English, and we didn't speak Japanese, so yeah....). Thank you Ida! </DOC> Have stayed here several times for a single night, and this hotel always shines. Attentive and friendly staff is very helpful, location is close to a beautiful park and 5 min walk from the fish market. On this trip I actually bought some beautiful tuna frozen and carried it home to the US with me - with a little ice and inside a small styrofoam container it was easy to carry-on my flight and was defrosted for perfect sashimi when I arrived at my home in the LA area! Rooms are spacious, well laid-out, and have impressive views whether overlooking the harbor or the city. Also used the pool on this trip; located on the 15th or 18th floor, it too has a gorgeous view, was comfortably warm, and the spa area had a nice sauna, steam room, and array of hot tubs. Always a reason to return here! </DOC> Fabulous hotel in Minato, Tokyo. Nice location, great views -take a harbor view room, the view is worth it, well appointed rooms, friendly staff, a fantastic spa-health club, unrivaled whisky bar, what more could you want? I love this hotel. Great restaurants. Excellent breakfast. </DOC> The Conrad Tokyo is about a ten minute easy walk away from Ginza towards Tokyo Bay. It is in the midst of a very modern office and hotel complex above two stations and is on the 28th floor up of one of the blocks. Excellent sized rooms. Very tasteful modern decor, excellent wi fi and service. Top of the line restaurants with Gordon Ramsay etc in situ and the best in room dining burger ever produced in a hotel. Worth staying just to oredr teh burger. </DOC> as above i am not one for raving but this hotel its location -staff- rooms . well i just cant find fault other than its a Hilton and as rule of thumb never been happy with their reward scheme !!!! as it does not reward. This hotel from breakfast to afternoon tea cant speak highly enough. wish i could have stayed longer. Its opposite the park and ferry and near to all main attractions so if you can afford you have to stay. Thank you Conrad hotel for the best sleeps etc </DOC> I think it's a phenomenal hotel overall and I'm hard to impress. This hotel hits it out of the ballpark: - Stunning lobby and great bar - Fantastic gym and amazing pool - Pleasant staff and lovely restaurant for breakfast - Well appointed rooms </DOC> We had a bit of a mishap when we checked in and I didn't think it would be a great stay as it was a bumpy start at check in. Perhaps it was just one of those days.. For all parties involved. We did end up with our beautiful comfortable room and there were all the little extras that you come to expect from Conrad. The kids got themed water bottles and a little stuffed animal and wine and fruit was waiting in the room. The restaurants on site are spectacular. And the location of this hotel is so central. You can walk to the metropolis of Tokyo and steps away to the serenade palace tea gardens. Because it was our first family trip to Tokyo we did he bus tour of all the highlights and then returned to our favorite spots. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Tokyo. Thank you. </DOC> Great place to stay. Arrived at the airport, caught shuttle bus to hotel, checked in and relaxed!! Top place to stay, close to some great restaurants and convenience for the challenging Tokyo railway/tube/mono rail. Service top quality and the breakfast is one of the best in the world!! People very helpful, open and just a top place to stay. We will be back!!"
87,"Booked when a discount was offered and got upgrade to executive floor. Price was quite attractive with the discount. Stayed many times in various Hilton properties, but first time in Conrad. It was very impressive. Room is spacious, with very nice design. Staff was very helpful and friendly, and service is very good. Although the choice of food in executive lounge was not as much as I expected, they were all in high quality. They even offer made to order omelet in breakfast time. For location, it is located in Shiodome. A few minutes walk from Shiodome Station (Toei Subway Oedo Line), or a short walk in covered area to Shinbashi Station (JR and some Metro lines). </DOC> Stayed there twice in November - excellent service, great staff (very helpful guest relation managers Jonas and Lambert!), wonderful rooms - big, nice view anything you may desire ! Great views from the Lobby over Hamarikyu Park and the bay .- can't be topped! Breakfast excellent, just like the Japanese and the Chinese Restaurant. </DOC> This is an amazing hotel in terms of location, rooms and services. The rooms have great views of the city or Tokyo bay. Service is outstanding and the breakfast is one of the best we've ever experienced. The Japanese breakfast, which takes 30 minutes to prepare is worth the wait, though you will need great self discipline to not try the food in the first rate buffet while you wait. The location is great for a spread out city such as Tokyo with Shimbashi and Ginza nearby. It's a great place to give yourself a special treat. </DOC> Everything about the Conrad is perfect - including the beautiful harbour view, the hotel location just minutes fromTsukiji market and the Ginza district, the very large rooms, beautiful bathrooms and excelllent breakfast buffet with western, continental and Japanese offerings. It is also very close to the metro, JR line and the Hama Rikyu Gardens. But what is most remarkable is the level of service provided by all of the staff from the concierge desk to the restaurant staff. Truly impressive and exceptional. </DOC> This place is just outstandingly good in every way. rooms are beautiful, service is fantastic especially in the lobby bar. they will do anything to make your stay a special experience. location could be better though as its slightly out of town but close to an underground station. </DOC> 2nd time staying here this year and its a great hotel. Central location is fine for walking, visiting the fishmarket (be sure to smuggle some fresh wasabi root home from one of the small produce vendors in the fishmarket). Rooms are huge for Japan at 520 square feet with spa-sized bathrooms. Great technology in the room to control drapes, blinds lights, tv etc and REALLY comfy beds. Staff is very friendly and welcoming. Will return time and time again when doing business in this part of Tokyo </DOC> We have stayed in many 5 star hotels over the world, and this is one of the best 5 star hotels all over the world. Maybe because our rooms was upgraded to a large suite room. The room was huge and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel is perfect for holiday makers in Tokyo. Everything seem to be new and of high quality. The breakfast was well appointed and of superior quality. It was a memorable stay for us in the Conrad Tokyo. </DOC> We spent three nights here and had a lovely stay. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming. We were asked about our plans for the day, and it seemed like everyone had a recommendation for something to see or do no matter where we were going. The hotel pool was lovely and I wish we'd had time to go there more than once. The hotel is close to several public transportation options (especially great for getting to Odaiba), and it is very much in a business district. We were able to book and prepay tickets for the Airport Limousine Bus. This was a great service. When we checked out the hotel stored our luggage, and when we came back in the afternoon they made sure all our luggage (and us) got on the right bus."
88,"We stayed 3 nights. The room is very big, have a nice living room, a table desk,a great bedroom. The bathroom is nice and great. The view is amazing, looking the nice green park. Breakfast is very good, and good selection. The service is ok, i stayed many times in Conrad Tokyo, but this time i feel the service and staff wasn't great. Still, Conrad Tokyo its a wonderful hotel, great restaurant and food. </DOC> This was the second of the Conrad brands that I've stayed at (the other being in Bali). This one is by and far better than the one in Bali. The hotel is a top of the line 5 star hotel with the greatest of service. They give great recognition for Hilton Honors Diamond members, I was upgraded to a bay view room which was much better than the city view. The executive lounge access was also a treat, the food is provided by one of the restaurants and the drinks were really good. Would definitely want to come back to this hotel. </DOC> i took my family here for a long weekend as the start of a vacation. After the long flight from Atlanta we were tired. The reception could not have been better. Our bags were picked up at curbside and were in our rooms waiting for us when we completed checking in. The service in the executive lounge was impeccable. The Sushi chef prepared my son's favorite items as if he anticipated the request. Breakfasts were always excellent with warm pastries and cold juice. The location is perfect. It's just a short stroll to the heart of Tokyo and some serious shopping, something my wife enjoyed. </DOC> I was in an executive room so I can not judge the other rooms. It was absolutely spectacular from the moment I opened the door - I audibly said Wow! High ceilings, wonderful city views through floor to ceiling windows. Outstanding room lighting, decor,space and layout. Bathroom was spacious with separate tub and glass separation that allowed views. iPod docking, automatic switch for curtains, General kimonos as well as sleeping kimonos. Excellent service, very helpful and cordial. The only thing that was less than stellar was the gym -it had the basics but was minimal. Fabulous location - right by Shiodome and close to Ginza. </DOC> This was our third stay and it was every bit as good as the last two.. The Conrad Tokyo is like a well oiled machine. Everything works just as it should. The location is perfect, the rooms immaculate, the staff impeccable. It is our home away from home and remains our number 1 choice in Tokyo. Only slight disappointment was the lack of upgrade as a Diamond member and return guest. But still my first choice:) </DOC> Our stay at The Conrad was nothing short of amazing. The hotel exudes elegance and class. The staff epitomize true Japanese hospitality, they genuinely want to please. The rooms are spacious and beautifully designed with top notch finishes. Linen and towels fantastic quality. The rooms are well sound proofed which was much appreciated. House keeping very consistent always making sure the room was immaculately clean. The hotel is connected underground to the metro and JR which takes you anywhere you want to go and after 7 nights we finally got to understand how it all worked:) We loved our stay here and in Tokyo. Cannot wait to return!! </DOC> Simply the best Hotel in Tokyo. Location is perfect just above the Shiodome Tokyo Metro station, easily accessible to most favourite spot like Shinjuku, Shibuya, Roppongi, Ueno and etc etc. we stayed for 7 days, booked a Twin suite and were upgraded to the bay view with a fantastic scene of Obaida and the park. All agents warmly greeted us and they always smile - this small gesture of friendliness makes all the different between a mediocre to a true 5*hotel. On the first day i am asking about a place where we can have a good ramen, the concierge more than expected printed out all different kind of ramen noodle and places we can go and visit. This hotel have done beyond my expectation - fantastic and worth every cents.. </DOC> The Conrad is a quiet and elegant hotel in Japan's most hectic city. The lobby and hotel rooms start some 20 stories up, so the views are beautiful and the overall feeling is always tranquil. The hotel is an easy walk of the Ginza, the Japan railway, and monorail stations. There are a wide variety of inexpensive restaurants in the Shiodome shopping complex next door. While you are in your initial state of jet lag plan to get up at 4:30 am, put on some rain boots, and make the easy walk to the Tsukiji Fish Market and tuna auction. It is amazing."
89,"We enjoyed our stay in the Conrad Tokyo very much. We had a lovely comfortable room with the most fantastic views. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The weather was not so good when we were in Tokyo, so I guess we will need to go back another time. We would certainly choose to stay in the Conrad again. </DOC> Hotel standards in Tokyo are generally very high, certainly in the luxury segment. The Conrad is one of the best in terms of room and interior quality as well as level of service. Not sure about the location for tourists but for business I anyway tend to go by cab and most things seem quite close. Top marks from me. </DOC> As you take the elevator to the 27th floor lobby you are reminded of an understated luxury, with a lot of attention to detail, that is exclusively Japanese. The rooms facing the harbour have a great view and are gorgeous. A very Japanese aesthetic. The dining options in the hotel lobby are impressive. A michelin star French restaurant, a terrific Japanese restaurant and a wonderful general eatery. We basically ate in-house nearly every night! Much easier than braving the outside traffic :-) The gym is slightly disappointing. Fairly small with not much equipment. As for the rest, a divine experience in zen luxury. </DOC> I have now stayed here three times and hope to come back again for either business or for a personal stay. The hotel is beautiful. I like the fact that the rooms start at the 28th floor. Have had a view of the garden outside the last two times. They take service to another level. The room design is so very open and large and the bath is excellent -- large walk in shower (along with a tub for those who need them). Club lounge is well run but could use different food offerings each night if you are for a few days. My favorite hotel in Tokyo. </DOC> I only stayed for one night but was impressed by the quality of the hotel and the room. Top notch standard that in Europe or the U.S. Is hard to find. Of course Asia is different and Japan in particular, but still. Close to perfection. Only slight issue: not enough sockets in room to plug in electronics. </DOC> Nice hotel, very nice rooms with a great view, good comfort and amenities. Can be quite easily reached by train from Tokyo station. Location is ""ok"" - a comfortable walk of 15-20min to Ginza. All in all a nice experience. </DOC> The Conrad in Tokyo is gorgeous. The room, the bathroom, the view hypnotized my wife and daughter. If you have Hilton points, this is the place to use them. </DOC> I stayed here 4 nights during a business trip to Tokyo. I had a suite on the 31st floor, it was excellent. This hotel is very nice, one of the best Hilton properties for sure. Even the room service was good. The only down side is that it is super expensive and the food and drink have the same pricetag. Expect to pay 1500yen for a beer."
90,"Great staff spotlessly clean, great facilities. Famous for its little touches. Not cheap but really great international quality. Bedrooms are superb with every facility even an umbrella. This has to be one of the best hotels I ever stayed in. </DOC> Wonderful hotel, with excellent rooms with all the luxury you can wish for. The restaurants are very good and the sushi was out of this world.. Pity that the hotel is not in an area with some shops and restaurants, only the Hama gardens and the Tsukiji fish market are near. </DOC> I was here for one night on a stopover to meet friends. Location a few minutes by cab from tokyo metro station. Had an executive room, which as has previously been discussed, was amazing (pic attached). Location close to tsukiji (went there early for suchi breakfast). ALso checked out the executive lounge. It was not as big as I had thought it would be, but had a decent spread for breakfast and fantastic views. I would defenitely stay here again. </DOC> This hotel is one of the finest hotels Ive ever stayed in. Period. Service is flawless--the staff was outstanding. English is spoken throughout hotel. Rooms are modern, sophisticated and extremely functional and quiet. Executive longue had outstanding food especially at night where they served wine as well. The coneiergie team, especially Mr. Abe were second to none. Emailed them one day and they responded immediately. Provided print outs of additional places I wanted to see and how to get there. There is a business area with 3 computers and free internet access. There are two train stations within 200 yards of location so I dont know what one reviewer was talking about. Food is pricey but Tokyo has loads of great restaurants. Overal a fabulous hotel and a fabulous City. </DOC> As you would expect from the Conrad brand, an excellent hotel with every amenity and luxury you can think of and in a great location near both the subway and the Ginza district. Although, I was here on business for 3 nights and thus my needs were pretty much limited to food and wi-fi, I did feel that the hotel was a bit souless, sterile and lacked any sort of defining character. Not an issue on a business trip but for anything else, I am not sure this would be a venue I would choose. Having said that, breakfast was very good, dinner good but expensive and the bedroom spacious and well decorated. My only gripe would be the speed of service in the lobby bar which was very slow. </DOC> Just returned from six days in this fantastic hotel.The standards were top notch,great service,great rooms. I have stayed at a few Conrad Hotels and they do not disappoint. Great location to Ginza.The staff were polite and helpful,way beyond the call of duty and a joy to deal with,even staying polite to some extremely rude and ill mannered guests. Overall I cannot recommend this hotel enough, 10 out of 10. </DOC> Indulgent hotel - absolute first class. Rooms comfortable / quality furnished, bathrooms wonderful. We had a room overlooking Tokyo Bay. Ultra stylish, great eating options. Only gripe was that it felt a little on the periphery - a good 15min walk into the centre. </DOC> This was our third stay at the Conrad. It was a night away from the kids to celebrate our anniversary and it exceeded our expectations once again. The little extras and the quality of service have us looking forward a return visit. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet this time and it was of high quality. I recommend making time for a quick workout and then hitting the spa for a soak. A special thanks again to Ari. His enthusiasm and attitude are inspiring for me to be better at my job. Executive lounge is stellar. Bedding note: two twin beds are large enough for 2 adults and 2 children. However, I am not sure what is allowed by the hotel. Disclaimer: IHG Elite and Hilton Gold member."
91,"This was a night away from the two kids and a return to the Conrad did not disappoint. The high quality and service is our benchmark for judging other hotel stays. The tea session at the Executive Lounge has the added touch of ice cream. Granted the city view from the lounge is less scenic than bay view, but not a deal breaker. As a note, my wife and I concluded Ari the X factor. He brings something special to that hotel and I hope he is recognized for his efforts. </DOC> We spent 2 nights at this gorgeous hotel. It's location in close proximity to a Ginza and across the road from the Hama- Riki gardens just superb! The staff from the moment we walked in were so helpful and friendly. This was the rule and not the exception at this marvelous place. The breakfast was great- supper with Martini relaxed on the 28th floor. A truly relaxing break before our cruise in sumptuous spacious surrounds and a stunning and large standard room. As a Hilton Honours member we also got a 7 am early check in complimentary, in spite of me offering to pay- true class and a true reward program. Keep up the good work. </DOC> We stayed at the executive floor with a great city view and compliementry breakfast every morning. We visited their gym and pool, very nice. They did a great job with their concierge service, very helpful. The hotel is located right next to Ginza with walking distance and a subway and JR train stop near by. Also about 10mins walk to the Famous Tsukiji fish market. Our room was very nice and the service is great. I have no complain about this hotel. They also have a great view of Tokyo bay and the city. Very city feel but also very quiet and well rested! </DOC> Very nice up to date rooms, with pleasant views over the bay. Service is great as always with lovely gym,pool and restaurants .restaurants can be pricey so watch that .but a lovely stay. Would only say bring plug adaptors as The electrics in the room don't provide for international applications. </DOC> We had a wonderful room on the 36th floor. The rooms are spacious and everything we wanted. Close to the park and shopping in Ginza. Just a few minutes walk from the fish market and Tokyo Station is a 5 minute cab ride away. We did enjoy breakfast there every morning at the buffet and it was nice with a large variety. No complaints at all. </DOC> The attention to detail were noticed and greatly appreciated by my wife and I as we celebrated our 12th wedding anniversary. Overall, the quality of service throughout the hotel from check-in to the Executive Lounge was outstanding. We look forward to a future stay. Hama-rikyu Gardens is five minutes away and well worth the 300 yen. It closes at 1700 and takes about 60 minutes to walk along the various paths. The edge of the Ginza district can be reached in 5-10 minutes </DOC> great welcome, extremely friendly staff, room as clean as ever and the view over the old emperors garden and tokyo bay I just gorgeous. however some small dents appear: - the brakefast room gets overcrowded at times and the waiting staff has a hard time to refill the buffet.. - also unacceptable i find is the fact that since over 6 month both english keyboard desktops in the business center are out of order and nobody seems to know when replacements will arrive... </DOC> The Conrad is a relatively new hotel in the Shiodome area of Tokyo. The style is ultramodern and the hotel plush and comfortable. The room was first rate, comfortable, large, well appointed and with floor to ceiling windows. Only two complaints: for a luxury hotel at > $450/night, they are fond of nickle and diming you for everything. Secondly, the service was highly variable. If there was no one else in line, the desk staff were attentive and helpful. If there were people in line, the staff showed no urgency or interest in helping those of us who were waiting. Certainly not my experience at other Tokyo hotels."
92,"why stay anywhere else? beautiful architecture, great rooms, excellent staff. </DOC> Perfect stay, left us speechless. Our room at the 37 floor and the club lounge were all unforgettable. Breakfast was exceptional (included for gold and diamond Honors member - you can and should take it downstairs at the restaurant rather than at the lounge. The service here beats every Conrad I have ever stayed at. Only complaints: The spa can't be relaxing when there is SO much light at the hot tubs, saunas and resting areas. No reachable power outlets in the room (one on the floor). </DOC> We stayed for 5 nights and enjoyed thoroughly the meticulous attention and service of the hotel associates. The associates went out of their way to recommend how we can send our luggage to Haneda ahead, as we were headed away for a few days before returning to Tokyo. Located within easy walk to the metro lines and JR line, the hotel is easy to use as a base to get to places of work apart from the taxis. The roads around the hotel are still having construction works. Only one issue for us: the lights at the front desk is rather dim. Perhaps this might negatively impact the sights of the associates working there? </DOC> I stayed at Conrad for 6 nights back in May. The service from the moment I arrived to the last day was faultless; the staff was always attentive. The room was large and extremely comfortable. I ordered room service on 2 occasions and the food was truly delicious. Breakfast had a wide range of selection and a choice of egg dish. During the week breakfast was always very busy and on some occasions I had to wait in the queue outside or left unattended because the staff was too busy to take me to a seat. So if you’re traveling for business just factor just in a little bit more time in the morning. All in all extremely happy with my stay. </DOC> First visit to Tokyo/Japan, so nothing to compare with. But the Conrad rooms were wonderful. Spacious and airy, comfortable beds, good view (although facing into the city, sadly, not the bridge). Loved the bathroom with free standing bath, and my favourite Aromatherapy Associates products. Breakfast was good, didn't try other restaurants or bars - put off by smoking allowed in main bar. Service was very friendly. Would certainly recommend. </DOC> The hotel is 6 years old but it looks and feels brand new. This is absolutely the best Conrad Hotel I have stayed in. The guest rooms are extremely stylish and comfortable with an exceptional bathroom. My only niggling criticism which is my bug bear, there's no free wifi. Why don't hotels of this standard include it as standard?? I had the nicest vegetarian meal ever in the Mitchelin star Chinese Restaurant. Very expensive but worth every penny. </DOC> Conrad Tokyo, the best hotel in Tokyo, occupies the 28th to 37th floors of the building cross to Shinbashi and Shiodome metro & JR station. My room was 30th floor, room No. 3021 cross to elevator, but quiet. Very convenient. It has nice sea view and big bath tab. 29th floor has Spa with swimming pool and sauna. I enjoyed swimming from 6am before breakfast. On the ground floor we got our wonderful glance at the beautiful plum blossoms that were starting to bloom all over the country. For breakfast from 6:30am, marvelous food and hospitality. I took pictures my breakfast and my room during 3 nights staying, so show them on my review. </DOC> The hotel situated 10 minutes walking distance to Ginza by upper walkway that connects few business buildings in the area. It's very convenient and you can easily walk but not on the sidewalk of the busy street, but on the upper walkway on top of the street. It's very unique and very clever. The hotel itself have great views and great room. Very clean and they do serve good breakfast on the club floor. The shower is amazing and the bed is very comfortable. The staff also quite helpful and very friendly."
93,"The views, the location, the staff, the quality of everything. There is probably not a hotel better than the Conrad Tokyo. The views from the lounge and upper floors is absolutely stunning. The lounge also had great breakfast and snacks during the day. The place was also so clean. I have never been to a cleaner hotel. Not a cheap place and it cost me a gazillion points but this memorable stay was worth it! </DOC> perfect location with direct access to underground station. perfect service. outstanding brakefast buffet. large rooms with beautiful views over tokyo bay. simply a heaven in a large city. the japanese restaurant is my favorite in town. </DOC> I did enjoy my two night stay taking advantage of the Visa Signature Luxury Hotel Collection offer. One of the best hotel in Japan has an excellent service, even for the Japanese standard that offers nice service and cordiallity and make you feel you are very especial. As a HHonor Diamond member & Visa promotion, I've been upgraded to a lounge floor and had breakfast in the Lounge one day and at the restaurant another day just to have a comparison. Both wonderful, but more intimate at the lounge and a huge selection at the restaurant. Lounge is small e quiet busy during evening coktail. The room is vell decorated and the view is just breathtaking overlooking Odaiba, Rainbow Bridge, Harumi Futo, Hamarikyu Garden, Sumida River and Tsukiji Fish Market. </DOC> I recently stayed 6 nights at The Conrad on the executive floor. This is a phenomenal hotel. Being there was a vacation in itself. I didn't want to leave. </DOC> Spent 4 nights here this week. Every part of our stay was great. The front desk, concierge and bell staff were great. The personnel in the restaurant and bar did a great job! The location is very good and the views of the harbor are stunning. Rooms are quiet and comfortable. I would highly recommend the hotel and would definitely stay here again. </DOC> I had a city view room on this occasion but the room was nevertheless marvellous. Spacious with a good working area, it is most suitable for late night calls from the room. Internet connection was a little spotty at times from the room, but still satisfies my needs. Price-wise is in accordance to the standard of the hotel, though it did not include breakfast in the booking. You probably get use of the clubroom on the 36th floor (good views) as a Hilton gold member. Yes the rubber duck is in the bathroom, but who has time to soak in the bath! Probably better to have a stayed here on a combined ""bleisure"" (combi of business and leisure) trip. </DOC> Conrad Tokyo was excellent, with very large rooms and great quality of service. Pros: - Extremely spacious rooms, discarding my prejudice about Tokyo hotels. - Very high quality design and furnishings, up there with Mandarin, Ritz, Four Seasons, at a more reasonable price. - Unlimited number of devices can connect to the internet for free and the standard service got the job done. - Exceptional service, very friendly staff, who are eager to help. - Open views as the hotel rooms start at 30th floor of the building. Cons: - Location is probably excellent for business travel, but a little bit off for leisure travel. You have to go 5+ stops on the metro to reach Roppongi, Shibuya etc. - Can take a while to go to your room as the hotel lobby is located on 28th floor and the rooms start at 30th floor. You have to take two elevators. </DOC> Beautiful property in modern business section of tokyo. Definitely worth it to stay on the bay side. View was outstanding Rooms are nice, perfect for two a little tight for 3. Bathroom is very large, wish the bedroom was bigger and bath smaller Excellent breakfast buffet definitely worth the price and included with Gold or higher Hilton honors My highest recommendation is for the concierge desk. I contacted them about a month before we arrived and they helped with restaurant reservations including one in Kyoto, a tea ceremony, boat tour and even looked into a dance performance for me. Responses were superfast and they were extremely helpful in coordinating activities They could not have been any nicer in helping me plan a great family vacation"
94,"We are staying in the Conrad Tokyo when we travel to Japan this time, and we are staying in one of the Twin suites and the suite is just beautiful, clean, simple and of course, comfortable. The service, the food, the room, the gym, everything are just so good and we have a memorable and enjoyable time here at the conrad Tokyo. All the staff are very helpful and caring, especially, Mr. Yasutoshi Abe & Mr. Yukihiro Taniguchi, they are always willing to go the extra mile, very helpful and friendly! Absolutely the best conrad staff in Asia! Although the location is not that perfect, it good enough for me! The Conrad Tokyo is highly recommended anyway, you won't be disappointed. </DOC> I have stayed at the hotel around four times over the last ten years. This stay was for six nights over the year end holiday period. We stayed here as we wanted to use the lounge facilities for breakfast and drinks at night which are exceptional. The breakfasts are simple but sensational. The hotel is also a short taxi ride to Haneda on the freeway. It is convenient to offices in Shiodome and a short walk to Tsikiji Market. As usual the hotel service is exceptional. The staff are very polite and efficient even when the hotel is crowded. The only down side is the hotel is starting to look a little tired and may be due for a refurbishment. </DOC> We have stayed at different Conrad throughout Asia, and we have to say that this hotel exceeds all expectations! The service is impeccable, and we love the bed linens! So comfortable! We got upgraded to a suite, and that was super nice! Love the location! Will definitely come back. </DOC> I think this is the best hotel I have ever stayed so far. The service from its staffs are no equal. We were greeted by name from the time we entered the lobby, the check in process is smooth and fast. As diamond member, I got a bay view room and access to the executive lounge. The view is fantastic, can see the bay and rainbow bridge. The food served at the executive lounge is so good that make me almost do not want to eat out. The room is very big and clean, kids able to run around. The bed is very comfortable as well. It has a good location with pleasant walk to the subway and train station and can easily get you to anywhere in Tokyo. The limousine bus stops in front of the hotel, thus makes it easy accessible from Narita airport. We can't wait to go back. </DOC> Loved this hotel from the first step inside. Incredible room, views, evening lounge, concierge and food. Location of this hotel is excellent and connected to subway. Harbor area is walking distanc and main street of shopping in Tokyo is a 5 minute walk. I found an amazing room rate and this is by far one of my best stays ever anywhere :) </DOC> This hotel is spectacular in many respects. First the location. It's well connected to the trains as it is located close to shimbashi and shiodome. I took the train to and from the airport. Second the height. How many hotels have you been where the lobby is on 28th floor!! The rooms are large with great views. Third the service. The staff are very friendly and provide great service. </DOC> Having stayed here previously a few years ago I already had high expectations but these were easily exceeded. The rooms are comfortable and spacious. There is free wifi, free spa/gym/pool access and free water by your bed every night. But it is the staff who make it so great here, I can't say enough about how nice and engaging they were, and not just one or two of them but all of them. It is perhaps the best service at a large hotel I have ever experienced. If I had to give a negative it would be that there are no power outlets by the bedside tables although there are plenty elsewhere in the room (I'm hoping management reads this and installs them). I would definitely stay here again if coming to Tokyo. </DOC> This hotel has perfect rooms with all kinds of gadgetry. The rooms are spacious, elegant, and clean with terrific views of the surrounding city. Hard to fault the room in any way. The service was also exceptional. Although our bags were a couple of minutes late in arriving at our room when we checked in, the bellman apologized profusely and refused a tip, saying that he did not deserve a tip! Concierge services were very helpful. My only complaint about the hotel is the price of food at the restaurants, particularly the Gordon Ramsey restaurant. Ramsey persists in charging high prices at his restaurants worldwide, but provides tiny portions - so you need to eat elsewhere after you are finished. There are other noted chefs that charge less and provide food just as good. Even for an expensive city like Tokyo, the restaurant prices should be about half of what the Conrad charges."
95,"Located within Walking distance of the Ginza and Tsujiki fish markets, and easy access to Shiodome and Shimbashi stations. The hotel offered an excellent concierge service with lots of helpful advice, restaurant reservations and maps. Three adults shared a twin Suite city corner, which was a more economical than an additional room. Comprised of a very large bedroom, lounge and bathroom with separate toilet, shower and bathtub, it fitted three people comfortably with plenty of space. Large windows had great views of the city lights. Everything was beautifully appointed and extremely comfortable beds. Highly recommended. The hotel is located on the 28th floor of an office building and had beautiful views across the water. High tea was popular in the lounge on the weekend. </DOC> We stayed in Conrad Tokyo for 2 nights. Overall it is an excellent stay where we all enjoyed. We have been upgraded to executive rooms which are big and comfortable, though the view has been blocked by 2 high buildings next to it. The staff are all very polite and nice, the only comment is that check in can get very crowded and slow. We had breakfast in the hotel, where the food is only good (we were late so did not get to try a few enticing options that take a long time to prepare) but service is excellent. We also had a few drinks in the bar where you get a great view of the bay. </DOC> I can normally be quite critical on my reviews, but this hotel is superb. I stayed at a Westin, Ritz Carlton and a Hilton during my stay in Japan, but the Conrad was the best of all four. It has an attractive pool and fitness facilities, small executive lounge compared to 2 other Conrads I have stayed in but it is welcoming, excellent main breakfast, fast wifi connection, very helpful and polite staff. As for the room, these are of a very generous size, well designed (apart from not having a plug near the bed, or at least not that I could see), and a big bathroom. </DOC> Stayed for business, great sized rooms and easy to operate functions, the usual clean and neat Japanese style but not the usual small style. Get a room with a view over the water, stunning by da and night. Definitely one of the best around. </DOC> This hotel is almost perfect. Its location is very good - away from the central hustle-bustle of Shinjuku and Shibuya yet well connected via close public transport options. The quality of finish of both the fixtures and bedding etc is superb. The staff are excellent, the Japanese restaurant (try the Teppan option!) is fantastic and the executive lounge very good indeed. The only downside is that it is expensive - but bearing in mind that it is a top-end hotel in Tokyo, perhaps the price is in proportion to the product. I do hope I make it back there soon! </DOC> Elegant, classy and functional appointed rooms. Particularly, I enjoyed the smart mechanisms allowing to clear the glass wall from the bath tub to enjoy the outside views while relaxing. Variety and quality breakfast buffet. Outstanding customer service. </DOC> only 10 mn from the Fish Market (Tsukiji), this modern hotel has a top class gym and swimming pool. Also a very good Spa. the Sushi Bar is one of the best i have found in hotels. Staff is extremely friendly and room are very large and very well presented. Ideal for business, perhaps a little pricy for tourism. </DOC> Stayed there again in September ... as expected .. great service ... the rooms were fantastic .. had fantastic view of the tokyo rainbow bridge. The hotel staff were always very very helpful. It had not deteriorated in service at all."
96,"I loved this hotel - the location, the rooms, the staff - everything was excellent. It is close to two train stops, so you can get anywhere you need from here. It is also right next door to the fish market - so the best sushi in the world awaits you there. It is also a walking distance to the gardens. The views are beautiful on both sides of the hotel - the harbor or the cityscape. The breakfast was very nice too. </DOC> A great hotel, nothing to say. Stunning view, great service, beautiful rooms, stylish common areas, superb restaurants (Had spectacular sushi at the Japanese restaurant and one of my best burgers ever at Cerises, the French one). Highly recommended, especially if you manage to get a room with a view on the bay and access at the executive lounge at the 37th floor, which is an excellent facility. Only thing to have in mind is that you need a cab to go to most places: the Conrad is conveniently located but still you cannot walk to most places. If I had to go back to Tokyo, in any case, I would definitely go back to the Conrad. </DOC> Fantastic views, with afantastic room, and fantastic staff, and a fantastic breakfast, and fantastic facilities, and a fantastic location. What more could you want? Which is better, the Conrad Tokyo or the Mandarin Oriental Tokyo? We stayed at both this month and it is too close to call. They have quite a different feel, but both are superb and both must be amongst the best City hotels in the world. </DOC> The service and quality once again did not disappoint during our anniversary stay. Ari and his team are consistently the best. I recommend checking in a little earlier to allow time for the sento - very relaxing. Afternoon tea in the Executive lounge is outstanding with the ice cream and coffee selections. </DOC> We decided last-minute to extend our stay in Tokyo and booked the Conrad with reward points. The service at the hotel is of a very high standard, from the friendly reception in the GF lobby to the smiles around the check-in area to a very friendly Italian staff at the restaurant. The room is of good size with a very impressive bathroom (double sink, shower and very pretty bathtub), comfortable bed, big screen TV, a somewhat small desk and a very long sitting area along the window. The only two concerns I had with the hotel were a) the lack of recognition of the Gold status (no info on benefits provided) and b) the very busy afternoon tea (practically impossible to get a table without prior reservation. Maybe the hotel could reserve some area for last-minute walk-in residents. </DOC> The Conrad somehow manages to mix the subtle with an innate ability to impress. The hotel is beautifully decorated, complimenting the fine views of the city and of the Bay. I had a huge king size with city view, a treat of a room with lovely window seat, comfy bed and a well appointed bathroom. Staff were very friendly, provided assistance when necessary and gene really had a spring in their step. Don't miss the pool! </DOC> This hotel is easy to get to from the airport (HND and NRT). Very professional staff and top notch amenities (pool, for example). The rooms are nice. Prefer the side viewing Tokyo Bay. The breakfast is great. We stayed in the executive lounge (which was well worth it), but visited restaurant for breakfast. It was filled with great asian as well as international food. No issues with the hotel or location. It is close to the GInza area/street. If possible, visit it! Questions, message me. </DOC> I visited this hotel for a couple of days with my wife as a treat, and we certainly enjoyed the experience. The room was excellent, the welcome efficient and quite warm, and almost every detail met our expectations. The only exception was the lobby bar, where the cocktails were mixed by incompetents. I ordered a caparinha and it was appalling, managing both to combine incorrect ingredients with an extremely weak mix. Believe or not, the bar staff put lemonade into it... I sent this monstrosity back and ordered another cocktail, which improved slightly to just ""bad."" It was a shame that an otherwise excellent hotel does not have properly trained bar staff. Avoid that, go have dinner at the Ramsey instead, and enjoy your stay."
97,"The Conrad just grows on you. Rooms are of good size and comfortable. All very clean. Location is also good and just a 10mins walk to Ginza. However, on one day we found ourselves waiting at the Concierge Desk for around 7mins without anyone helping us at all. She suddenly appeared from the back. Also our bathroom sinks seemed blocked - although we complained it was fixed for one day before reverting to previous state! Overall comfortable, not quite Peninsula standard but not far off... </DOC> My first time here and this is an impressive hotel indeed. Entering the ground level concierge lobby one immediately knows this is a luxurious and elegant hotel with the design and sculptures. The main lobby is on the 28th floor . Service is very good, even by Japanese standards Location is quite good with Shiodome metro just underground. 10 min away is the larger Shimbashi JR station for further needs. Also 15min away from Ginza for many shopping and food options I booked a suite so the room is large, and wonderfully elegant. Not too many tv channels but this is a tiny blemish. The bay view is excellent Didn't get to spend time in the gym, pool or hotel restaurants but I'm sure they are wonderful . The whiskey bar at the lobby is a good place for cigars and whiskey Hopefully I'll get to return here at some point </DOC> This is NOT your typical Japanese Hotel ... extra large rooms ... good location next to the Yurikamome sky train line OR a short 7 min walk (All underground / sheltered) to the JR Lines at Shimbashi. Service is impeccable. Will do the little extras if you are Hilton Honors members. Spend the little extra to get the bay facing rooms ... won't regret it! Also the Narita Airport Bus takes you to the doorstep of this hotel ... so no walking needed ... wheel your luggage from the coveyor belt the the bus curb side ... someone loads it for you ... arrive at the Conrad ... hotel staff takes it and brings it to your room ... what more can you ask .. </DOC> I've stayed here 3 or 4 times, and each time I've been very pleased. It's pretty pricey, but the rooms and especially the bathrooms are very nice. The bar/lounge is fantastic (albeit very expensive), and the swimming pool / sauna / spa are also high class. The best part of all is the executive lounge, where one can enjoy a good breakfast and excellent cocktails with canapes in the evening. Their sparkling wine is always excellent (usually a Cremant de Bourgogne). Other than the high price, everything about this hotel is top notch. </DOC> One of the few hotels I stayed in (and I stayed in many, around the globe), on which I can say only one word: ""Perfect""! Everything- The room,amenities, facilities, service, executive lounge, staff - was perfect, with not one glitch. The toilet seat is heated and has an options of flushing your bottoms, and you simply don;t want to walk away from it... It is just above the subway station of the Oedo line, just 20-25 minutes from Haneda airport, and a walking distance (10 minutes) from Ginza quarter. </DOC> Check in was very smooth and view for the 28th floor lobby is wonderful, facing rainbow bridge. Room is very spacious and very clean, maybe too big for single person. Location wise it is just nice located next to Shiodome station (Yurikamome line and Oedo line), or you can also walk for about 8 - 10 minutes to Shimbashi station to get into JR Yamanote and other lines, thus it is very convenient to go places. </DOC> Everything about this hotel is perfect. It's a 10 minute walk from the Ginza district, yet the area around the hotel is quite and peaceful (as it's in a more business district). Trains are easily accessible The service is remarkable, the rooms are impeccable, the breakfast and lounge were great, and the bar is world class. This is hands down one of the best hotels I've stayed at (and I say this coming from the Park Hyatt Tokyo the prior night). </DOC> The rooms are beautiful, modern and large with sweeping views of Tokyo. This hotel is on the 28th through 38th floor of a new office tower in the Shiodome development next to Shmbashi Station. The health club is good and it has a lap pool. The only downside is that to access any train or subway station or to reach any of the restaurants in the neighboring buildings, one has to go through some sterile, underground ""habitrails."" One is guaranteed to get lost at least once."
98,"Very grand hotel, good for business and romance. The bar sitting by the reception is very nice! beautiful view to the Tokyo night. HIghly recommended. The staff were really sweet and helpful, they even left two cute bears on the pillow. </DOC> I arrived in the early hours of the morning but all the staff were friendly and helpful. The room was spacious and comfortable with most things you might want... Apart from accessible plugs by the bed to charge your phone - a must have these days. However a bigger miss was a mirror in the main area of the bedroom. There is an admittedly large and well lit bathroom mirror, but to access that is likely to mean encountering a wet floor from the shower, so not ideal when barefooted or wearing socks while getting ready. There is a mirror opposite the wardrobe but the passageway is narrow so it is difficult to get a view from any distance to check how your whole outfit looks. These are two small things, but in the competition for 5 star hotels these little things matter. It should be mentioned also however that views over the parkland and river are spectacular. </DOC> Recently completed a 5-night stay at the Conrad in Tokyo. Highly recommend this hotel as my experience was excellent! The room was impeccably clean and well appointed. Sleep was great and room was quiet. Everything felt new and clearly the hotel is well maintained. Views of Tokyo Bay are stunning during the day and at night. Enjoyed breakfast each day and had plenty of choices. Location is super convenient as the Shiodome Station is located at the hotel. By far the best part of my stay was the staff. Particularly Mieko and Matsuzaka on the Concierge Team, great service ladies! They made numerous arrangements for me prior to our arrival and provided outstanding service during our stay. I cannot say enough about them - they are the best! I would absolutely stay at the Conrad again. </DOC> Our first hotel in Tokyo was Conrad. And I'm glad we made this choice. This Hotel was one of the highlights of our trip of 5 weeks to Asia. The check in was very quiet and, as part of the benefits of Visa Luxury Hotels in were upgraded to a room with a spectacular view of the Bay of Tokyo. The room decoration, amenities, breakfast, public spaces, location, everything else was perfect! Access to subway and JR was quick and easy! But the staff is the crown jewel of this property! Everybody nice and polite. I want to thank especially Ari, for having made our stay something so amazing! Super recommended! </DOC> i am so amazed with this hotel. the breakfast is amazing. so many choices. if you are diamond member you got a free breakfast. the room is amazing. they upgraded me to a suite room. wow!!! thats like 2 times the regular japanese room. they also have a premier floor, they let me me stay there and enjoy food till i need to depart to aiport. amazing hotel </DOC> We NEVER stay at large international hotels but did this time thinking to ease ourselves into our first experience in Japan. Perfect! The Conrad Tokyo is very approachable but also totally Japanese. Everything from the Front Desk to the room to the breakfast buffet was absolutely impeccable. The room was large with a wonderful, huge, bathroom and great soaking tub, and gorgeous view of Tokyo bay. Breakfast was bountiful, both western and Japanese style. Concierge was extremely kind and helpful as were all the staff. Every single detail was impeccable... Would be easy to move in! </DOC> Stayed here for one night. Great experience from check-in to check-out. Friendly staff that speaks English well. Beautiful, clean, and spacious rooms. Modern bathroom with excellent soaking tub. Located within walking distance to Ginza, Imperial Palace, and Tsukiji Fish Market (especially convenient if you intend to attend a 5AM fish auction!) Will definately stay here again in the future. </DOC> Just had 4 nights at the Conrad. The rooms are lovely and spacious by any standards, and enormous by Japan standards! Had a good meal at Ede restaurant on 2nd floor of Shiodome City - but lots of choice nearby if you don't want to eat in the hotel. Good for walking to sights or using subway/Trains. Glad of HH diamond card for free breakfast/Internet etc. Would be very expensive otherwise. The only niggle was the executive room did not have a good view - this is different from all other Hiltons's/Conrad's I have stayed in which have wondeful view from the exec room."
99,"Hotel is in an excellent location with a subway stop underneath and within walking distance to Ginza and Marunouchi. Service was excellent. We arrived at the hotel very early in the morning and the staff were kind enough to let us check in half a day earlier than the standard check-in time. Also, I left a package in a taxi one day and the concierge helped track down the taxi and got the package safely back to me. Rooms are very spacious and beautifully designed. The room was serviced impeccably. Acca Kappa toiletries, which were nice. The only reason I'm rating this 4/5 instead of 5/5 is because they don't provide free Internet/wi-fi. </DOC> This was my sixth hotel in a two-week Asian business trip, and this was the best one. In fact, it ranks in the top 2 or 3 hotel rooms I've experienced. The hotel itself is a little odd, as it starts on an upper floor of a building. The lobby is very modern and not very inviting. The room, though, took my breath away. It was huge, had a bay view, a couch across the entire window, and a large, gorgeous bathroom with free-standing tub from which one can enjoy the view. Shades can be drawn down the bathroom window for privacy. Also, instead of a little mint on the pillow, they left a box of four truffles. Service was excellent, too. This will be my first choice when in Tokyo. </DOC> Loved it. LOVED IT! Gorgeous immaculate high floor view suite with knock out water/city/park vistas. A star of a concierge/manager young man named Arrie (spelling?) who spotted my jet lag & fatigue from across the lobby and escorted my husband and me directly to a complimentary cocktail while the cute clerks checked us in. Was he clairvoyant? Intuitive? Genius? Yes-he was all of the above AND got us a last minute lunch reservation to one of Tokyo's best TINY superstar sushi places! Which was one of the highlight's of our stay. I'd stay there again in a hot minute-and take Arrie out for cocktails next time! Oh-insanely delishious breakfast buffet. Immaculate, fresh, delishious. </DOC> Stayed with family in transit to usa . Was fun , very polite staff .. Wonderful experience , Manager of hotel went out of the way to help us out and see that we had a good time . Location is prime area .. No complains .. Will come again end of the year .. </DOC> I have to give my thumbs up to the Executive Club Lounge staff as well as Ali, the service manager. Services were excellent. You can never get a better services. Having to stay at top notch hotels, I believed the staff here has portray more than just professionalism and hospitality. The hotel vicinity is closed to a lot of eateries area and the fish market. One thing Conrad can better itself is the look of the rooms. I think it is pretty running old. Housekeeping is one of the best I seen so far. Selection of food for breakfast as well as club lounge meals can be further improve. Else this is a great hotel to stay in </DOC> Pluses: New, state of art furnishings Extensive food court of restaurants in same building, with choice of many types of food Top quality service Extensive mall nearby at the Shiodome subway station, for food and shopping needs Minuses: Hard to find. While hotel says it is right above the Shiodome subway station, this is a little deceptive in that there are many office buildings above the station which itself has many exits. It took me 15 minutes of walking around with luggage in the dead of night to find the hotel, only after running into a local who could point me in the right direction. Hotel has a reception lobby on the 20th floor, then a long walk to the elevators which you take up to your room. Not easy to get to your room from the outside...count on a 10 minute commute just to get to street level. </DOC> My friend and I toured Tokyo during the cherry blossom festival this spring. Most hotels were sold out, so we used points and switched hotels each day. The Conrad was in a great location close to the fish market and Ginza. It was close to 2 metro lines. The room was beautiful, clean, and amenities were plenty. Service was friendly and helpful as well. </DOC> What a different world when you get into the lobby, see the cherry tree, listen to the wellness music and go up to 28. Floor.reception very polite and friendly. Right room to the bay is important. Rooms are welll designed. Free wireless lan. Perfect room service.breakfast is excellent. Great location. Concierge is very good. Restaurants also good. Both. Bar is still a spot to be. Service very good."
