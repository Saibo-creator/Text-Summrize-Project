A large breakfast buffet with plenty of choice. The hotel is located in a quiet area of town so it is easy to walk to MRT. Only downside was that there was no lift to access to the lift, which they did not have a sign to keep up with. Staff were all very friendly and helpful."
1,"The location of this hotel is a little difficult to find in the city centre but it is a great place to stay. Well located, the building and rooms were excellent. The room had a lot of noise from the road and the air conditioning was cold. We were given a small shower and were given a kettle with tea and coffee. Tea and coffee were available in the morning. Nice pool, bar area, no place to sit and no one could find anywhere else. Would like to see more consistency in the rooms. In summary, we would return."
2,"I was in the area for a business trip to Seoul. The hotel is very nice, good location, good breakfast and friendly staff. Hotel rooms are not big but they have an excellent view of the city and the airport and close to all the main attractions of interest. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Room was quiet even though they have a car park. Will return"
3,"Threading is a good hotel for the money. Staff were very friendly and helpful, but not a lot of people in the hotel. The rooms are quite large & spacious with good facilities. Only negative was that they charge for bottled water (at least the restaurant was closed on Saturday). Food was good and staff friendly. Only downside was that the room service was not refilled so can't comment on that, and I would have liked to have done a better room but this hotel also has a lot of potential to be a good choice."
4,"Threading is a good hotel, the staff were very friendly and helpful. I was given a room with 2 double beds and a single bed. Despite that, the bar is clean and well equipped. The lunch menu had some of the best food, just what we needed after a long day of sightseeing in the centre of town. Well done to the management, they deserve to be a great hotel."
5,"We booked a standard double room for one night, the staff were friendly and helpful. The food was excellent as was the service. Hotel is situated in the heart of town and a short walk to the main square and many restaurants. Breakfast buffet is excellent but no variety of food. There is a hotel that does not serve breakfast so you can't comment on the hotel as it is a good choice for a hotel in the area."
6,"We arrived in the hotel after a long day of driving from Ireland to the UK. A little bit far from town centre but only a short drive to The Bund. The rooms are spacious, well decorated, and they have a nice pool and breakfast area. the beach is a must do but be prepared to drive to the beach or other tourist areas. Breakfast was very good and staff were very helpful. Will return to this hotel again"
7,"We spent 2 nights here in the last 2 months. The room was large, comfortable and had a very comfortable bed. the staff were excellent and a credit to the hotel. Breakfast buffet was a bit disappointing as it was not served until 8:30 am, staff not friendly enough to serve us but the food was good as always. Pool area is in a lovely area but not much in walking distance, but it is a short walk to the centre of town. Easy to walk to shops and restaurants and shopping in the neighbourhood. Recommend"

The location is great - easy access to the main street and very close to shops and restaurants. Staff were friendly & helpful. They were very helpful, breakfast was good, breakfast was fine, breakfast was also good. Would definitely stay again."

Food was good and the bar was great. breakfast was ok, nothing special but the best I've had anywhere. would stay here again."
10,"Threading stay in a very nice room, the staff were friendly. I had stayed here before, but it was a bit tired. Breakfast is good but the bed was very hard and the pillows were too soft. The bar is not too bad but the hotel offers a good choice and service. Very good service. Parking in the basement is very good. I will return."
11,"The staff were friendly and helpful. Unfortunately we were on the second floor with a small balcony. The room was small but functional, the breakfast is not that great. I do not understand why the hotel is not full of food and service at the restaurant, but I did not eat at the restaurant or to eat at the restaurant. Just a basic experience - what a shame. Would stay here again if I was in the area. Well done, I will be back. Well located for a few days"
12,"I picked this hotel based on the reviews and was pleasantly surprised. Staff are friendly, helpful, and efficient. The rooms were small, but clean, with a good shower and the hot tub was good. Breakfast included in the price - decent enough. Free WiFi wifi which we enjoyed. Good location for sightseeing and walking distance to the town centre. Would stay again, but can't comment on the location."
13,"Unexpectedly good location in the heart of town. Very friendly and helpful staff, good breakfast and a large room. Our room was small, but clean. Parking is a little tight in the evenings. We did not eat in the restaurant. We were here on business, but it was not that bad. The rooms are older but not adequate for a business traveler. Not a bad place to stay."

They had a nice pool and spa area with a small bar. I did not try the breakfast or any other food choices in the hotel. Free wifi. Would definitely stay here again if in the area."

We have been coming here for many years and have never had a problem. Friendly staff. Breakfast is good with good selection of choice. The property is very well done."
16,"Threading and value for money. This hotel is in the middle of nowhere and has a very nice private terrace overlooking the sea. Staff were helpful and friendly - great room and good bathroom . The hotel is not in the centre of town. Staff could do with a bit of a bit of an attitude. I stayed here for two nights and would come back again, but will not return."
17,"The staff at this hotel were great, although the hotel is a bit dated and not well maintained. Only a few minutes walk from the beach. Staff were friendly and helpful. Large rooms with a very quiet room, a clean and comfortable room, no complaints at all, only drawback was that there was no air conditioning which was a little annoying. Overall a very pleasant stay and I would return."
18,"Have stayed here before, very good value for money. Very friendly hotel, very clean and well maintained. If you are a light sleeper then ask for a room that is not open on the weekends but not a problem for me. There was no lift but I did not have any problem with the luggage and the breakfast was not cooked properly and the sausages were fatty and overcooked."
19,"Have stayed at this hotel several times over the past year and weâ€™ve been to many times. The location is great for exploring the lake, very easy to find. We had a great view of the river, which was nice with good food and drink in bar. Had a large group of four adults & 2 children. rooms are small but clean and the bathroom was clean and well stocked. Rooms adequate for a short stay"
20,"I originally booked this hotel for one night as it is right on the river. The staff were great, and we enjoyed the evening meal and the dinner. Hotel was lovely, nice bar area. Our room was on the ground floor and overlooked the street. Good sized rooms, good bed, nice bathroom. Free Wifi is a bit limited but it is a good value for money. Would stay again."
21,"Threadt is a great place to stay with a small group of friends and young children. The hotel itself was very good, but the room could have been cleaner. However, they had a good selection of food and drinks. the staff were very friendly. Negatives: the reception staff were not helpful, but did not do anything about it. Would not return to this hotel, but I would recommend the hotel and will return."
22,"We stayed one night at the Inn in the area and decided to try this hotel. The restaurant, bar and restaurant were very good. Food was excellent and service excellent. Only downside is that the rooms are somewhat dated but with a couple of rooms, a pool, to have a drink and drink or a drink. Will return next time we visit the area. I have seen better days in the world"
23,"The Royal Oak and the Hotel is a gem. It's about a 10 minute walk from the main train station and restaurants. A good restaurant with a wide range of rooms, great pool, but not really enough staff to speak English. Breakfast was excellent, staff were friendly and helpful. Staff were all very friendly and helpful."
24,"We stayed 3 nights at the hotel on our last visit to the south shore. The staff are very helpful and professional, food is good,drinks very good. Room was big with all mod cons and no fridges. Hotel has a large pool area with open fire and a spa in the bar. Food was excellent. No complaints at all. Loved the bar and the food. Thank you!"
25,"Threading is a very nice resort with a large variety of restaurants in the area. Two pools, steam bath and sauna, 2 treadmills, etc. Excellent service. They have a restaurant and bar and the food is good. The hotel is quiet but then you have to walk to the hotel but this is a major drawback. We were not able to use any of the facilities in the hotel. Housekeeping staff very helpful and friendly"
26,"Unexpectedly the staff is wonderful. The resort itself was very spacious and clean, but a little dated in all areas. We had a small group of 4 adults and 1 child for a week. Rooms have been refurbished but had been renovated with a new look and its staff are not very friendly. One of the best hotels in town for dinner. Only negative was the restaurant - not open at all. We stayed in the restaurant, which was better than most Holiday Inn Express hotels."
27,"The Westin is a very new property and it is now one of the best hotels in Europe. Very friendly staff, excellent service. The rooms were lovely, clean and well equipped. Breakfast was good with a lot of choice. Not a lot of options to eat in the hotel but they have a good selection of food, not for vegetarians. But the best thing about the hotel was the staff. A bit of a walk to everything but not in the heart of downtown, and I'll be back."

Room was clean and well appointed. No lift or balcony. The rooms were dated but adequate. Negatives: no view from rooms, and no air conditioning, so you have to use a car park."

The hotel has a great pool and the rooms are not huge but they have a good breakfast buffet, fresh fruit/coffee, free coffee and tea (as well as free) as well as many other hotels in town. Staff very friendly and helpful. Would stay again but if I come back to the area I would probably try to avoid the nearby restaurants."

No staff at all and no English breakfast. No breakfast in the morning but it looked like they had been made for me to be replaced by housekeeping. I will not be back."
33,"We travelled here on a business trip and found the hotel to be quite good. The staff were very friendly and helpful, food was excellent - room size was adequate. Reception staff were friendly and helpful. One thing that doesn't make up for the lack of breakfast is the lack of a buffet, the food is a little too small for what is in the bar. Staff at reception was helpful and friendly, but not over the top. Handy for walks of people to thank you."
34,"Have stayed at this hotel several times, and it was a great experience. Our room was large and comfortable. We had a very pleasant view of the city in the morning (which is a good thing!) The staff were pleasant but the food quality could not be faulted. The breakfast buffet is good with a good range of options and the staff were friendly. One minor point was that the bar area was not very clean and the tables were not cleaned properly. I had to ask for a drink from the bar to get a drink in the bar area. All in all, a good place to stay."

There are a few restaurants within walking distance and has a hot breakfast buffet with a choice of food, and many other local restaurants - like I am a regular traveller"

The hotel is set back from old and old fashioned but good. Breakfast buffet was good with lots of choice and good selection of food. Rooms were a little tired and some of the rooms have been renovated but still has a good view. We would stay again."

However, the staff were not helpful. The bar is a bit noisy as it was a little chilly, but we did have a good night's sleep. We did not eat in the restaurant, but it was fine for a 3 night stay. Breakfast also served a very good choice."
39,"Threading is a very nice hotel with good service. The staff were friendly and helpful and the menu was varied and well presented.

Cons: I had to walk to the hotel to get to the hotel and they were not able to use it."

There are a number of restaurants and shops within walking distance; one of the best restaurants in town with a nice outdoor pool. I like this hotel and will return.

They have a nice business center with a Starbucks/bar. Overall a very good value for the price paid and the staff was very nice."

There is a wonderful view of the mountains. The restaurant was very good with a wide variety of foods and wines. All staff were very nice and helpful. One of the best hotels we have stayed in, and we did not try the restaurant - perhaps the best buffet in the world. Only negative was that there was no water in room, so we went to reception with a bottle of wine."
51,"The room was a bit dated, but clean. I am sure this hotel is new, but it has closed in the winter months and it is still a bit of an identity. Good food but the staff could not do enough for you. Very professional staff and friendly staff , clean and tidy with a good ambience. Altogether a very good experience in Vietnam but its all about the staff"

Walking distance to a number of restaurants and bars. An old building with a large lobby that has a large feel to it. There are no restaurant options for dinner, hotel restaurant is a bit of a let down. No restaurant, not a good choice."

The food is excellent although the prices are quite high for what you get. Staff were very helpful and friendly. The only negative point was the poor wifi - could not connect to the lift - they were unable to connect to the old house! Would not return!"

However, the room itself was not cleaned up well, although there was no air conditioning in room. Breakfast is served in the bar area, no table or table with tables so no tables cleared. Food in restaurant was good but not outstanding."
55,"I was in the middle of nowhere in April. Rooms are spacious and clean, very comfortable bed and food. We stayed in the new wing & it was awful. There was a strange smell from the kitchen, which was not particularly useful. They need to have a better staff as it has a lot of noise. Not sure if it is worth the money. Stay here if you want a place to sleep. Otherwise, a good place."

Didn't have breakfast but the staff did a fantastic job of keeping the food stocked and ready to help. Will stay here again next time I am in town."

90,"Nice hotel with a wonderful staff. I was booked in for the first time, and it was a pleasant experience. Hotel is well positioned and has been recently renovated. However, the staff were very friendly, and the rooms were clean. Room was spacious and clean. The view from our room was spectacular. Will return again. Yes, it was very busy but we managed to get a good night."

Food is excellent, service excellent and room very clean. Staff very helpful with all the staff. Food is excellent and the buffet breakfast was excellent. I have not stayed here before but will be back soon."

I was not disappointed. good location for the beach and restaurants. Close to everything. Great location, a good location for visiting the beach. Pool was very nice and staff was very helpful. Will stay here again"
93,"Threading is a great location in the middle of the city. Beautiful hotel, rooms are large and spacious. However, the staff was very helpful. I had to ask for a room on my own. The staff was rude and unhelpful. Had to ask for a cup of coffee, not only did I have to pay for my credit card, but did not have a card. Breakfast was disappointing and had to be sent to reception staff."
94,"We were in the area for business meetings and the hotel is not exactly what I expect for a business trip. The location is fantastic, right in the heart of downtown. Beautiful rooms, great service. Gym and gym are very good. The hotel room, however, was tiny, dirty and dirty. Food was not good. So I am not sure if it was my last day of year but now they have a full service hotel. What a shame! Thank you for your kindness and hospitality."
95,"The staff was lovely, the hotel is well maintained and has a very nice atmosphere. We had a room with a balcony overlooking the sea (I'm not sure why). Hotel has been renovated and shows its age. Very clean, comfy bed, good bathroom. Food was excellent and I'd recommend the chef to the chef. A good choice for a short break"
96,"I travelled to the area for business and had a wonderful time at the hotel. The room is very spacious, with all the amenities, and an excellent location for exploring the city. But, no free wifi, no buffet, no free wi-fi, no food available (not included in price). Food was good. They have a small gym, but no one in charge - get rid of the Sleep Inn. What a pity!"
97,"I arrived late at night, the hotel is very well kept and has everything you need. Hotel is just steps away from the main train station, but you can walk to all the shops. The rooms are spacious and really well appointed. Rooms have all you could need, and large bathrooms. Staff were friendly and helpful. Only downside was that they had a club lounge, bar, bar, lounge and bar staff. Thanks for a great stay"
98,"We originally had booked last minute in advance. Hotel is very well situated in the middle of everything. Rooms were clean, spacious and fully equipped kitchen and bathroom. The gym was huge, huge and well appointed with great bed. The hotel also has a shuttle bus to the city center of the city. But the view from the reception area is amazing! Went to the hotel for my birthday, so I went to the restaurant for dinner. Hotel staff were super friendly, but couldn't be bothered to see what I was doing. Might be a bit more expensive"
99,"I picked this hotel because its location near the beach and it was perfect. Staff are friendly, helpful, attentive, helpful. The rooms were not changed in the past but the hotel has been renovated but now it shows. Rooms have a balcony but no air conditioning. No tea/coffee making facilities to walk around and no coffee. A few years ago we went to the bar and had no problem staying here. No one came to help us. I asked for a drink and when we returned to my room they said they were 3.5 miles away."
