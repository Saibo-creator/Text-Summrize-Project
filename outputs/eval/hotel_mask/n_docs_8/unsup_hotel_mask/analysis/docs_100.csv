1,"wife and i stopped over for one night , room allocated did n't have a shower , so they moved us without a problem , room was nice and clean , remember it 's an old building very quiet at night, breakfast was good , meal in the hotel at night was excellent , one tip for the management do n't let your staff drink at bar one in particular was overly loud and did n't do your business and good apart from that liked it a lot </DOC> first impression was poor as i waited in reception for 5 minutes unattended before being greeted by someone who had clearly been smoking outside .after that things improved , room was small but clean and functional bathroom , evening meal in the bar was better than expected for a monday night , breakfast was good and the view across the road to warkworth castle fabulous . </DOC> i stopped here for 1 night and occupied a front room overlooking a lovely large beech tree , which obscured the view of the castle .the room itself was decorated to a good standard with lovely thick tweed style curtains .it was fine with a drench shower in a good size enclosure .the bed was comfythe open hall downstairs is flagged stone so you can also hear everybody coming to bang the fire door in advance ! ! !i had a very nice steak meal in the pub and the breakfast was also very nice .i had the kippers which although fiddly were delicious .all the staff were very busy but the service was very good and everyone was pleasant .good size car park to the side and rear and easy access onto the road . </DOC> we were made to feel very welcome from the moment we checked in until the moment we left .after a peaceful night the northumbrian breakfast from the extensive breakfast menu the following morning was excellent and served efficiently .also it was a pleasant change at breakfast to help yourself to freshly brewed coffeewe would stay again and thoroughly recommend it . </DOC> a traditional hotel and pub with a view of the castle at the top of the village .whilst the room was quite smallit was fine for a stopover .breakfast was excellent and the bar meal was ok ( the restaurant is closed on sunday evening ) .it 's a friendly place , good value& it 's well - organised with good staff . </DOC> whilst touring this lovely part of northumberland , we stopped at this hotel in castle terrace , right by the castle walls .a lovely old hotel , which served us a meal , in late afternoon , which was very good , well cooked , and hot , well priced , 25 % cheaper than dining down south .the staff were extremely friendly , and welcoming , on a lovely sunny day which it was , there could be nothing better we loved it .they also had rooms , but we do not know what they were like , but in they are anything like the rest of the hotel they will be fine paul and joan bennett </DOC> the sun hotel is located right across from the castle in warkworth -- a beautiful setting .the restaurant is a bit on the upscale side -- quite nice -- and the food is a bit above average .service is slow but that seems to be the norm in northern england .this is a very enjoyable place to have a relaxing dinner in the shadow of a compelling historic site . </DOC> the owners had recently taken over and were gradually updating the hotel .those parts that were complete were qeite nice .the staff were particularly helpful .the dinner menu could have done with having a greater selection of dishes ."

8,"in some establishments , people in our situation are treated badly , but i must say all the staff and management were very friendly , welcoming and supportive . organising chairs etc for us was no problem .we only visited the reception , function room and bar area , but everything was very nice .all very nice .apart from the group we were involved in , it seemed as though most people were there for the golf , with the course right outside . </DOC> the hotel is a little tired but the staff are excellent and the food is great .the golf is good but the hawkstone course was my favorite as some of the championship holes were very long .the golf bar was freezing cold and beer is expensive as is the pro shop shame as this spoils the experience .all in all good value at this time of the year . </DOC> other reviews correctly note that the rooms are tired and in need of a refurbishmentmy room was a little basic but clean and a decent size .so this is good value .anecdotal comments heard in myvisit suggest you can get absolutely cracking deals combining golf and accommodation .the restaurant and bar areas are good and we even managed to sit outside one night – amazing that this british summer allowed it !a private meal with all of the participants from the golf day on my second night here was very nice .where this place really scores is the golf , although it ’s a shamethe clubhouse is modern and looks nice .the 2 courses are in great shape ( even more so considering the bad weather so far this summer ) . </DOC> a great weekend of golf , 2 excellent courses , very busy and 2 weddings also whilst we were there .the food is fine , staff excellent and fantastic location .the hotel though is run down , tired and in total need of refurb , overpriced for what you get , the net curtains and shower curtain must have been in the room for 20 years or more ....but sadly the hotel needs more than just new curtains .i will return to play golf , but not stay at the hotel incurrent condition . </DOC> staff at this hotel were very friendly and accommodating .breakfast was excellent and dinner in the restaurant was of a good standard .the bar with the open fire is a lovely place to settle and spend the evening after walking in the area .the rooms are clean but a little cramped and probably need an update to the decor . </DOC> there are some good deals to be had on the hotel websitesso it seemed very good value including breakfast .the rooms are a little dated and could do with modernising but overall were comfortable and had the typical amenities .the bar area was adequate with a fair selection of beverage choices .breakfast was a typical buffet style but did offer a good choice andoverall a nice hotel , good value , good service . </DOC> the golf course looked nice and the clubhouse was in good condition but the hotel and in particular the rooms at this hotel are in dire need of updating .in my room which was like stepping back to 1970 the decor was poor , there was damp in the corner behind thpae tv and in the bathroom roof bead the showerand it was very cold all night .as i said early this hotel is clearly concentrating on its coreu clientele hence the need for twin beds in all the room , very friendly staff </DOC> overall things were fine .excellent golf course ( hawkstone ) very helpful staffvery good dinner good breakfast and lunch .public areas of the hotel were good .i think some of the more negative posts relate to an annexe , which did n't look very enticing to be fair , so specify main building when bookingin line with earlier posts , the pies are only average ."
9,"stayed at hotel for a golf weekend with a small society ( 12 ) . booked a single room which although bijou , was more than adequate for purpose .room was modern and all that one could want for a golf trip .lounge / restaurant was contemporary and the evening meal enjoyable .breakfast equally as good .bearing in mind that this is a three star establishment , i thought the hotel and golf courses were good value for money .would have no hesitation in returning . </DOC> we stayed here for one night following a family wedding elsewhere in the area .the reception staff were very friendly and helpful .we wandered up to the golf clubhouse and enjoyed a couple of drinks on the balcony with its charming views .these were reasonably priced and good .our room was ok , a bit dated , but clean and the bed was gloriously comfortable .the public rooms we encountered on the way to our bedroom were very gloomy .breakfast was fine , all the usual components of a ' full english ' , excellent bacon , marmite as well as jam and marmalade .perfectly acceptable for one night , and as we did not have time to explore the famous hawkstone follies we would like to return and would happily stay at this hotel . </DOC> we ' ve stayed here before , so it was nice to see the programme of refurbishment has rolled out across most of the hotel , the unfinished sections did n't impact upon our stayand it 'll be a vast improvement over the old decor in the public areas .the hotel is clean , tidy and the staff friendly and helpful .is very dog friendly and there 's plenty of walks nearby to exercise them .obviously the hotel is focused upon golf , as the course is the major feature of the area , the amenities are good , parking plentiful and the clubhouse even if you 're not a golfer ( as we are not ) is friendly and welcoming .plenty of country walks and things to do in shropshire and across the county border into cheshire .and hence you 're getting good value for money .good value for money and enjoyable stay . </DOC> what a find , nice quite ye olde world but attached to two full size golf courses ( not that i play ) .rooms are a decent size a worth the money , the bar it quainte and all the staff are very friendly helpfull , basically look after you , point of note if like me you eat in the bar the tables are very low next time i will use the restraunt .set in large grounds unfortunately the weather prevented a walk round but it looked very nice breakfast pretty much eat as much as you want all in all for the money paid </DOC> 2 rounds of golf , dinner , bed and breakfast .great value as always with these deals .having two contrasting but both decent golf courses is always a bonus for a quick break .massive bacon roll on arrival in the clubhouse , which has a massive bar area on the upper floor overlooking the course .smooth visit to the pro shop to check - in , fairly slow round on the hawkstone course with some very quirky holes .good atmosphere in the clubhouse bar afterwards .recently refurbished , it was well - appointed if a little small . bar area was pretty good and lively on a sunday evening .the dining room was very busy but once inside the food was nice and service good .breakfast was excellent . </DOC> we always enjoy the challenge of the two excellent courses .the hotel however is so tired & not changed over the years .when i spoke to holly on reception , we were eventually given a luxury room including a separate suite , outside patio , very nice & spacious , still tired & dated however .the staff in the bar & restaurant were all great , dinner & breakfast were good standard . </DOC> it was full of golfers , being a golf hotelthe room is probably due a decorate and the bath roomcould do with an upgrade , but only minor point as it was very comfortable .the food was excellent i have to say </DOC> value is truly excellent - £ 99 for two games of golf , dinner , b&b .b three course dinner was nice enough .pate starter was pretty plain , paid £ 9 supplement for a sirloin steak which was good and the cheesecake dessert was fine .plainly it does n't register on the green - keepers maintenance list ( did you visitthe championship course is a good test as is the hawkstone ."
10,"we stayed here for a couple of days playing golf and had a very pleasant time .the staff were very friendly and helpful and the food for the evening meals and breakfast was very enjoyable .the bedroom was large and comfortable but the bathroom was very tired and not very clean .the external of the hotel was also rather tired and the price of drinks was rather expensive but overall a rather nice stay .there is wifi in the rooms but only the first hour of your stay . </DOC> although the hotel is a bit dated and needs some decorative and furnishing attention , for usit was fine .the staff were all polite and very helpful .dinner was really very good - not gourmetit was of good quality , well cooked and very tasty .the main reason for our visit was the golf .we were lucky with the weather and that is bound to make a difference , however remembering it was october the courses were in good nick .in my opinion this is a better course than the "" championship "" .the tees , greens and fairways were all better on the hawkstone and the scenery is terrific with some real quality golf holes . </DOC> both courses at hawkstone park are greatbut i can stay the follies coursesis the best one we have ever played on in the uk todayno two holes the same in very good order and at a great price of the tee times website drinks in the club house are too high that s the only down side about the place . </DOC> on arrival i was met by this young lady at reception who came across bored and uninterested , she was also biting her nails whilst talking to me and looking for paperwork , very rude and unhygienic .there was no other guests at the deskso check - in was quite quick .however , she only explained how to find the room ; she did not explain anything else about the hotel such as wifi , breakfast times , etc .breakfast cold buffet was very limited in choice and very sad looking .there was no hot buffet as per description on breakfast menu !and they charge extra for smoked salmon !room was nicely decorated and warm , although a bit small .the bathroom was very cold and the shower was not good , the power did not go up at all .dinner was nicer than i had expected .restaurant staff was polite in the evening and both mornings . </DOC> the good bits ... the most comfy bed i have ever had at a hotel and the view from the room was lovely .if i had paid full price for the room i would have been livid .there were stains on the carpetsthe walls badly marked kids had even drawn on the walls .the tv s small and out dated .. still the old square ones .the table had many marks on it .the bathroom outdated .one thing that did bother big time me is we turned the tv off when we left the room when we returned it was on again and a different channel from the one we was watchingdo .i think the food would have been lovelyhad it not been cold .breakfast was nice bit you have to serve yourself </DOC> the hotel reception , rooms , bar and restaurant all passed our tests for service , cleanliness and flexibility .the bar staff excelled themselves in staying awake so long , retrospective apologies offered .the golf was less professional , with a tee - time error which was however quickly remedied .the old course was lush with good lies but it is obviously well - used and a bit worn - out .would be good if there was water in the ball cleaners for example and there was no water for sale in the 9th hole vending machine .to cap it allthere was no lemonade in the clubhouse barso no shandies .but we would give it another go . </DOC> we have been going to the santa safari at hawkstone for years nowand after a couple of disappointing years , i am happy to say the excellent santa safari is back on track and better than ever .departure for the trip is back at the hotel like the good days and plenty of thought and planning gone into making the whole event festive , magical and very special .it was great to see the dining room full of happy families again .the food and the accomodation were good and the staff were excellent .i recommend this trip a lotso i am glad its all back to the high standards that bring people back year in and year out .well done hawkstone park , thanks for everything </DOC> we found the young staff very friendly and helpful .food was of a very good standard , with adequate choice , though breakfast late arrivals would regularly find that choice was very limited , as things had run out and not been replenished .the standard of the bedroom was poor .much money needs to be spent on a major refurbishment to bring it up to a satisfactory standard .the shower though hot was poor due to minimal water pressure .i would play golf here again , but would not stay at the hotel again ,"
11,"lovely place to stay and not far from shrewsbury which is a great place to shop .the scenery is gorgeous and the santa safar at christmas is well recommended .look out for barry the elf .not just for children , the whole occasion is festive , family fun and memorable .value for money . </DOC> the course was great apart from the weather giving it a beating the last few weeks only down side on the course£ 4.25 a pint the pro shop and staff all made us very welcome </DOC> we stayed at hawkstone park for two nights whilst attending a wedding nearby .the hotel was fine for a short stay and we did get a very good deal -our room was spacious and the beds comfy , but very dated ( particularly the bathroom ) .the whole place is desperately in need of refurbishment and upgrading both inside and outside .indeed all the staff we met were very friendly and eager to help .dinner was ok , but again the dining room is so stuck in the 70s/80s .this was not a massive problem to us , but then the guests all seemed to have to walk past our door to get to their rooms and then there was a great deal of dragging of tables ( or something ) until well after 1.00 p.m. </DOC> the room , though small , had been upgraded and was clean and comfortable .the dinner was good but not overly fancy .the golf club centre is rather dated and the service not great .the food also was rather ordinary .the golf courses however were both in great condition and a challenge for all golfers , especially the championship course .the complex in general is in need of updating to match the quality of the golf courses . </DOC> the hotel is conveniently only a chipshot away from the first tee of the hawkstone course which i think is the better of the two courses at this venue .the staff are friendly and the buffet breakfast is very tasty .but that does n't detract from this being a great choice for a golf society break .thegreens were very good and the balcony at the clubhouse is a super place to knock back a few beers whilst watching people play down 18 </DOC> over the last few years we have watched as the hotel has become more and more tired .wall paper is coming off in places , stained carpets and so on .however , the rooms are clean , the staff are excellent and the food we ate at the function was very good . </DOC> a group of us stayed here for a wedding nearby and , after being in se asia recently , it was a disappointment to be honest .the decor is tired and needs a major refreshbut i suspect that the availibility of a good golf course helps them get away with that for golfing types .despite what others say the quality of the breakfast food was very good and replaced regularly which is important as places can stint on quality of ingredients too often .it was not worth themoney to be honest although it could have been good . </DOC> for some time now i wanted to go to see the hawkstone folliesand it was a last minute decision to book a room at the hawkstone park hotel nearby .the hotel has recently been renovated and there is still a bit of scaffolding about but the suite we had booked was very pleasant and sunny with a large balcony overlooking the golf course .evening meal was included in the price and the food was excellent and very well presentedand we really enjoyed our meal despite the noisy background from a nearly fully booked dining room with golfers on a special golfing deal .we realised that it was the same young lady who had left the building when we arrived and was obviously aware that we had come to check in and after the rather long wait we expected an smile and an apology for having left us waiting"
12,"this hotel is on the trafford centre complex and recently built it is a short walk from the trafford centre , event city , legoland and sea world .rooms are typical of the brand and clean and spacious as expected .breakfast is the brand 's standard limited buffet but well cooked and kept stocked up . </DOC> stayed here a few nights whilst passing through trafford .the hotel is extremely modern and funky with a good vibe to it .the staff all display excellent team skills whilst working hard .the rooms are bright and airy and have air conditioning units in the rooms .the beds are really comfortable and some even include sofa beds .sadly this hotel fails on this front .also if you have an evening meal and the incentive is 1000 bonus points then do nt bother as you never get your pointsit 's a scam .in conclusion , the hotel is so close to the trafford centreits an ideal location its literally across the road 5 minutes walk .i will definitely stay again just a real shame that you never get your promised bonus points despite repeated emails and assurances but never mind . </DOC> great bed lovely shower .little things like iron and board in room now only downside room still being cleanedwhen returning in the evening much improved brand having had a less than great night in another one </DOC> however it 's a great location if you want to go to the trafford shopping mall .a funky modern style layout and feel .there is plenty of parking which is controlled and secure .the breakfast is good and plenty of choice .filled my belly . </DOC> not recognised as a gold member receptionist cold and stand offish barman did not speak english and could not take food order food poor and waited - despite chasing 4 times-20 for desert staff do n’t interact between themselves or with customers not your typical hie </DOC> i recently stayed here as part of a work trip .the location was ideal for us at a 3 - 4 minute walk to the venue and also just over the road from the trafford centre !the hotel is very new and clean , our bedrooms were very well equipped ( iron , and hair dryer in every room ) as well as being spacious and comfortable .but it was okthis is n't ideal and not what i would expect to have to chase , however both issues were rectified immediately .the staff were all friendly and helpful and i would stay again for business purposes . </DOC> this new hotel is breath of fresh airfrom the moment you walk through the door into the very modern reception desks to the bedrooms and restaurant you find a spotlessly clean hotel .the reception staff were excellent and check in was fast and efficient .the rooms are amazing comfortable beds excellent bathroom they also have an ironing board and iron in the room .the price also includes a very nice breakfast cold and hot items are available and served in pleasant surroundings .ample free car parking is available .the situation of the hotel is first class and just two minuets from the m60 motorway and on the doorstep of the trafford centre . if you wish to visit manchester city centre i can recommend the x bus which passes the hotel and takes about 15 minuets or so .a wonderful hotel with a very dedicated and hard working team of staff . </DOC> stayed in this hotel recently .its right next to trafford centre and motorway network so really handy for commuters , with a large car park at the back too .the team are pleasant and friendly and there is a small gym which is not the norm for an express hotel ."

15,"stayed here a couple of weeks after it opened as it is very handy for the office of a client i visit regularly .i do n't know if prices were heavily discounted due to it being new , but other hotels in the vicinity( there 's a couple of premier inns close to the trafford centre)are usually quite a bit more .having said all that , there 's a nice big car park , nicely fitted out rooms with good modern touches like smart tv and usb charging sockets by the bed .restaurant / bar / lobby area is light and airy and breakfast was good .however , if the price is right , i will be staying here again for convenience and a decent room for the night . </DOC> well it 's a bit of an in joke with the superb staff at this great hotel , without a wiff of coconut .as soon as you walk in the door you feel at home , ok at the moment they do n't take amex but they will sort that .they are very clean and presented very well .the staff are absolutely brilliant a cheerful lot that make you 're stay a wonder .thank you all for making my first stay at this great new plush hotel a real pleasure .they recognise loyalty and offer good wholesome food for breakfast and although limited to the hol inn express standard menu the evening food is good as well ! to nathan and all the teami ' m off to check my dust caps and look forward to seeing you all again soon ! </DOC> room was small but perfectly designed .comfortable reception area with bar for nightcap . free parking and close to the trafford centre .we would definitely stay again and could certainly recommend to others . </DOC> great hotel , friendly helpful staff , lovely clean room , very comfortable bed .but i would definitely use this hotel again and would highly recommend it </DOC> on arrival i found the reception staff to be far from welcoming , as a regular ihg usereven on departure they lacked the manchester warmth .rooms are good , modern , clean although lacked the chair for desk work .wifi good for email checking . </DOC> so is very clean and well presented .my room was big with lots of room , quiet and comfortable .there is plenty of car parking on site .wifi was free and good quality .breakfast was good .the bar in the evening was the only disappointment , very slow service and no craft ale on sale . </DOC> nice modern hotel - good rooms , breakfast & safe parking .walk to & from old trafford takes about an hour each way which is longer than we expected !staff very efficient and pleasant !wi - fi very good . </DOC> this hotel exists purely for the purpose of event city and the trafford centre .rooms are nice .brilliant usb plugs by the nerds , comfy beds , nice small bathrooms with good showers .they forget to replace cups and this sums up what is mainly wrong with this hotel .like many budget hotels , staffing levels are too low .though the hotel is full ( and i know as the jobm working on has booked 150 of them ) there is one barman in the evening and one person on reception .too cold or too hot and dry which tends to suggestthat the air con units in each room do n’t really do what they say .i stay there for four nights and do n’t sleep well on any of them ."

18,"food was a bit formulaic and unimaginative .roasts appeared to be cooked in a steam oven and so lacked a real roast meat flavour .and they were cooked proficiently and the veg and gravy were fine .when the dishes arrived they all had summer berries from a standard frozen mix that you can buy in any supermarket at any time of year .overall , as i say it is just about adequate and the ethos seems to be "" oh well that 'll do "" and is hence a little boring .i think there must be better restaurants around and will try out a different one for sunday lunch next time . </DOC> the staff were very weloming .reception was bright and cheerful , the bar was very pleasant and with real ale served - a great plus for my partner .everywhere was clean and tidy .our room was comfortable and quiet - we had an excellent nights sleep .the ensuite was very clean and with a good shower .if we need to stay in the area again then we will certainly return to this hotel </DOC> we booked the main room at the hotel for my mother 's funeral reception as it is close to the crematorium .the staff were helpful and nicole happily kept taking the revised numbers .the food was tasty and the tea and coffee was fresh .everybody enjoyed the refreshments . </DOC> i was a bit disappointed by the interior of the room , which was n't very luxurious .we did n't eat in the restaurant , but had a drink in the bar on both evenings .this was n't very enjoyable as there were lots of people walking through the bar to go to a function room at the backand they were being rather noisy .this was a shame as the bar was housed in a very attractive room .service was mixed and it took me a long time both to check in and check out as the reception was n't manned . </DOC> on arrival ( approx 7.20pm ) , the car park was almost full .the room clean and suitable for my requirements .the kettle in my room was not working ( i reported to reception ) & the bed was a bit ' sqeeky ' , but generally had a good night sleep .the restaraunt service was good , although seemed to be a little short on staffing & the tables were not set ready , i had to wait .meal was good when it arrived , but it took 35 minutes from time of order .breakfast ( full cooked ) was nice .the chef came out and apologised that they only had white bread - the guest said that would be ok .when his toast was delivered ... he only got one slice , so he had to request more .not good enough in my opinion . </DOC> there was a handy and sufficiently large car parking area .upon arrival there was a roomy and bright ante room with a bar and comfy seating .the dining room was similarly bright and the tables were very well spaceda good variety of vegetables which were well cooked and plentiful .welsh cheeses but again unimaginative when you consider there is a magnificent cheese shop in narberth just 100 m away .overall value at about £ 15 a head was about right .and there was no attempt to rush us out which was nice .staff were friendly and courteous .overall i 'd use it again if in the area . </DOC> stayed here for 3 nights on a kgb voucher - fantastic value .great room - good size , very clean and lovely furniture with loads of storage space - about 20 drawers in total !the bathroom was a good size with one of the best showers in any hotelstaff were friendly , helpful and professional . ate in the restaurant on the first night and the bar on the third night - both meals and the breakfasts were excellent - well presented and tasty .the hotel is well situated just off narbeth 's main street which has a good variety of shops and restaurants .would definitely stay here again . </DOC> and as always the rooms are spotless , the staff very helpful and attentive and the food was once again excellent will stay again very soon thanks so much"
19,"we made the right choice staying here during our round - trip in cambodia .clean , relaxed stay , good food , good service , a nice swimming pool and a big clean room .would stay again .bycicles had a good quality to make a nice tour in the environment . </DOC> it 's on the rustic side in a tropical surrounding .hot water was available only by calling the front desk .mosquito nets covered each bed .tiny little lizards / geckos are running around at night and some are in roombut they do not bother you and are harmless .the pool is nice ....dinner was good and very cheap .breakfast was a set menu with different options .if i recall there was 4 options .location is along the riverside .quiet part of the town but short drive to the main area . </DOC> … … .. off the beaten track . beautiful hotel with great staff .lovely grounds , pool and good food .our room was pristine and my only niggle was the lack of a mirror in the main room and the fact that the bathroom was so dark .we had a very comfortable night </DOC> i ' ve travelled quite a bit in rural cambodia and most towns the size of kampong them do n't have anywhere as nice to stay as this .i had a bungalow that was nicely , but simply furnished and clean .the gardens here are lovely , as is the pool area .the restaurant is very nicely decorated and with decent food - some dishes were great , others fine but not amazing .we also did the sunset boat tour , which was lovely .the soap obviously had some kind of strong chemical colouring agent , as event bleach could not get it out - my shirt was ruined !this might be a good reason to change to a more environmentally friendly , less chemical soap . </DOC> a beautiful bungalow style hotel with very good location 400 meters away from the night market and centre of town , but still alongside the river .nice and clean bungalows with mosquito nets .nice veranda in the garden .the pool was clean and a delicious breakfast served on 1st floor overlooking the pool .the staff was very helpful from the first start with the welcome drink through to our check out .we would like to come back to this place . </DOC> the individual bungalows were a delight set in beautiful gardens .the room and bathroom were very clean and well equipped .the staff were very helpful and friendly .unfortunately food was n't very hot but plentiful and tasty .this hotel was a little gem but bugs were a real problem of course i understand that is beyond the hotels control . </DOC> all immaculately clean and well organised .a really charming and unique place to stay . </DOC> a pleasant hotel in a nice setting .staff helpful and friendly .restaurant food very tasty and authentic . reasonable prices for the area , free bicycle loan .a nice clean swimming pool in a lush garden setting .rooms spacious and comfortable .a quiet area of town and great for wandering by bikes to the town or by the river to a lovely village ."
20,"a point to remember about this hotel is that it is out in the coutryside of cambodia .the accommodation is very basic but there is a bathroom in each villa .the bathroom was very basic but served its purpose .our villa was clean and each bed had insect netting supplied .the room also had an air conditioner built into the wall - and the air conditioning worked !the geckos in the room during the night were very loud at times .i have n't had such noisy geckos in other places .we had been warned that the food service at the hotel was very slow .this hotel is fine for a one night stopover when travelling between phnom penh and siem reapbut it is not a place where people would spend the day relaxing around the hotel . </DOC> this was a delightful oasis .yes it is very basic , but that makes a stay here so pleasant .the rooms are very spacious , clean and comfortable .yes , you can see daylight through the tile roof , there is no tea or coffee in the rooms , and the lighting and bathroom is a bit dim , but that makes it so charming .however , the pool is lovely , the service is excellent , the staff are charming and the evening meal we had was fantastic .but it was great to be woken by village sounds ( along with gheko 's and frogs ) as this hotel is set a long way back from the main road .the hotel has free wifi and even free use of bikes , but what a great stay in rural cambodia . </DOC> it was okay for one night , but nothing special and found the staff not as friendly as elsewhere in cambodia .they have brought in a ' consultant ' to help them sort out some of the issues they are having with the staff andin particular the quality of the food .we were hoping to experience good local cambodian food but instead there was a limited choice ( 3 )main courses which had more of a safe western feel .not bad but rather boring and bland .on the positive side our room ( big garden shed ) was perfectly okay , old fittings but clean and functional with a nice outside sitting area .the pool area was good and a nice place to relax after a long drive . </DOC> this is a lovely place to unwind and have a nice swim and meal afterwards up stairs .this place is so relaxing , the staff are lovely and they have free wifi .you could easily stay a few days before tripping off to siem reap or going back to phnom penh .the pool is lovely and a great place to relax in . </DOC> hotel consists of bungalows set in lovely gardens .bungalow was very roomy and there was no noise from the street .cocktails were cheap and nips were generous .the dinner was very tasty however there was very little choice for breakfast .the only issue i would like to bring to management 's attention is the dangerous stairs leading up to the dining area . </DOC> i spent five nights at this excellent accommodation .we appreciated having a private outdoor sitting area , as well as use of the hotel ’s free bicycles .the staff were professional , the grounds were lovely , both the breakfast buffet ( on busy days ) and a la carte ( other days ) menu were varied . </DOC> but it is a real gem .the rooms are in bungalows with the most amazing gardens all seeming a bit like a tropical jungle .our room was rustic but clean , spacious and comfortable with mosquito nets and a fantastic supply of hot water .had great night 's sleep .the staff were all very friendly , the wifi worked perfectly , and the pool was beautiful .the breakfast , although slightly limited was delicious . </DOC> what a lovely surprise after a gruelling drive .the bathroom was unusual , of stone so although upon closer inspection i could see it was clean , first impression was not so positive .we were fine .dinner was very good , if a bit pricy by cambodian standards .wines at around $ 19 were very nice .staff were so helpful and caring .we enjoyed our night here and would return ."
21,"this hotel is a real haven , particularly on a hot day .the rooms are huge and so is the bathroom .the pool area is fantastic .we also had dinner and it was delicious and well priced .the staff is super friendly and attentive . </DOC> my room was very traditional and very comfortable .bear in mind that you are in the middle of the countrysidethe bar area has free wifi and a full bar service .the cocktails were great .breakfast was very basic .the setting and grounds were lovely .coming from phnom penh , it was really relaxing . </DOC> we stayed 2 nights in sambor village and enjoyed it a lot .the grounds were lovely with lots of plants .the pool really nice .food and the restaurant were really nice .we didn´t even go out to try other restaurants since we liked it so much .on all booking sites sambor village showed up as fully bookedwe did some tours to temples from there .the highlights weren´t the temples , but the landscape and people on our way .breakfast was good , staff very friendly and helpful and knowledgable on helping us with the booking on our onward journey .there are free bikes which we used on one night to visit the bat tree - highly recommended .the only negative thing is , that wifi was really slow </DOC> sambor village resort is simple , but pleasant with a lush garden and a swimming pool .the rooms are basic , but clean and the bed is firm and comfortable , equipped with a mosquito net .stir - fried dishes are tasty and healthy .it is not really a resort , but peaceful and relaxing , definitely the best place to stay for your visit to sambor prei kuk . </DOC> the bungalow style rooms are spread around .the pool was actually a bit cool .service was ok but not brilliant .rooms are carly large but amenities are ordinary .it did seem clean enough .some of our group had issues with hot water though we were ok .our big problem was apparently a wedding was nearby and loudspeakers were blaring chants etc from 5 am to midnight .it did not make for a very restful night . </DOC> this is a fairly small ( 19 rooms ) hotel about 600 m from the centre of kampong thom , beside the river .it is set in its own secluded and quite pretty garden , with the rooms in bungalows each with their own small terrace and seating .the rooms , all en - suite , are quite large and have all the facilities you ’d expect , including air conditioning and tv , as well as mosquito nets for the beds .there is a very reasonably priced bar next to the swimming pool( although the pool really needed cleaning out when we were there ) and a covered upstairs seating area .food is available ( we did n’t eat there ) and a buffet breakfast included in the price , a fairly limited selection compared with a big hotel but totally adequate and all seemed fresh . </DOC> we recently stayed 1 night at this hotel and it was lovely .the room was spacious and we had the best shower we have had this trip .the food in the restaurant was ok .grounds were lovely as was the pool .starting very early .service was good . </DOC> after a hot day 's cycling it was great to end up in this quiet sister hotel to the villa langka in phnom penh .we had an individual villa in the leafy grounds and , after a shower to slough off the red dust that forms the surface of all the ' off - the - beaten - track ' trails through villages and temples , a welcomed angkor beer by the pool was the order of the day .our meal that night was absolutely excellent , especially the fish and breakfast next morning was by menu , rather than the buffet style of the larger hotels , then it was off on the bikes once more en route to siem reap ."
22,"the scandic victoria tower in kisk is a well run business hotel .the rooms are not large , but very well equipped .the internet was excellent for a hotel .the restaurant serves an excellent buffet breakfast and lunch .close to the train station and a shopping mall .housekeeping could be improved . </DOC> i must say that this hotel is a fresh breeze .modern , free wifi , convenient located with easy access to public transport .a few coffee shops and restaurants opposite the hotel , but they are only open with business hours .about 10 minutes to walk to the kista mall open to 9 pm every day .the rooms are bright , modern and convenient , however i do miss a wardrobe in the rooms , no where to put your clothes .the staff is friendly and accommodating .the breakfast is ok , larger with many options to choose from including organic options .unfriendly staff , mediocre food with high prices .the sky bar on the 34th floor offers a great view , but can not serve coffee ,the answer given by staff member is that they do not serve any hot beverages in the sky bar .i would recommend this hotel to persons needing to find accommodation while visiting businesses in the area . </DOC> they easy chair in the room was very uncomfortable for me and there were no drawers to put ones clothes .the staff was outstanding , very friendly and helpful .the breakfast is excellent and free as is wifi .i would stay here again . </DOC> this new scandinavian style hotel is a big step forward for the kista scene .it is decorated with cheerful modern furniture , with functional yet a somewhat austere overall look .the artwork in the restaurant has a cool look but is not inviting ( what 's the scoop with the lady with the rifle ? ) .given that this is the 34 story business hotel in the high tech swedish silicon valley , they could do better to justify the price . </DOC> this was probably my 20th time to stay at kista scandic and the hotel never ever disappoints , clean and courteous service , polite staff , good food and walking distance to all establishments within kista .the bar on the 34th floor is the best thing to do in the evenings just to take a drink and sit by the window to watch over stockholm … nothing quite like it . </DOC> luckily i had the chance to stay in this new scandic hotel close to our office for a 3 days meeting .the hotel is new , so is everything else .the rooms have a bed and a tv , some strange windowsand you fell the "" nordic "" taste of empty rooms .the heating system in the bathroom was definitely set too cold .the shower cabin is not really a shower cabin .water gets everywhere out and the cold air of the bathroom lets your body freeze while showering .i really need fresh air while i am sleeping .that made me feeling very uncomfortable .a plus is the breakfast .that is as always at scandicin my opinion the hotel is a bit pricey .considering that it is located at the end of kista , which is far away from the city center of stockholm . </DOC> rooms are spacious and very clean .beds are comfortable , but i found the pillows to small ( too thin & not wide enough ) .the shower is good and powerful , and due to the bathroom layout the whole bathroom does n't get flooded .huge selection at breakfast .it was very busyreception staff very friendly and professional .the gym : a couple of treadmills , some dumbells & a multi - station .do n't expect it to compare to a commercial gym , but for a quick workout it 's fine .overall it 's fine for a business trip . </DOC> definitely a big step forward for kista with the following positives : nice and modern with large rooms .restaurant menu could use more variety and tired paper menus should be replaced especially given high prices ."

26,"victoria tower is a typical modern hotel belonging to scandic chain , actually i have scandic card but the receotionist to my understanding ignored it .the lobby is airy , nothing really to remember .the rooms are tidy and they have everything a traveller needs , safe and sound .nothing extra nothing personal .sky bar is worth visiting with nice beers and nice view . </DOC> i was working in kista for 2 days and it was certainly convenient and well located .it was also very quiet which was nice , almost too quiet !breakfast is great with a wide choice , and funky decor .i would stay here again though . </DOC> this hotel is located a few blocks from the trains that takes you directly into stockholm center .enjoyed my stay here , and will definitely stay here again . </DOC> great hotel for business if you are needing to be in the area .not in the centreso not great if you need to be therethe staff are very friendly and the rooms are very comfortable though i struggled to work out how the heating worked .breakfast was very good and plentiful with loads of choice .i would stay again for business and would recommend visiting the sky bar to see the views ! </DOC> i got room 802 and was surprised to see that a modern hotel was so clumsily made : when entering the room the door opens inwards with hinges on the left side and immediately to the right was the bathroom , also with hinges at the left : this means that the doors will clash if opened at the same some , and that the bathroom have to be opened fully to enter the bathroom .on top of this , when in the bathroom you almost have to climb over the toilet to enter the shower cabin .this was not very impressing for a new hotel .apart from that the room was fine in its scandinavian spartan style , with a great 34 floor bar and a typical swedish breakfast .i will come again despite not being impressed . </DOC> nice new scandic hotel .located in the middle between arlanda airport and the city center .great location for kista .the hotel is very modern with good sized rooms and well - arranged bathrooms .the restaurant offers quality food with good service and standards .the "" sky "" bar is great for a view over stockholm .if i was in this area again i would stay here with no issues . </DOC> this hotel is not far from the airport .it is a modern hotel which is a tall tower .the rooms are furnished well but the view is blocked by a design board which obstructs the window .one has to bend down to get a good view outside , the breakfast spread was good and the service of the staff was also good .we generally enjoyed our stay here . </DOC> a good , clean hotel .the rooms are very plain and stark ( think one step up from ibis ) , but clean .the views outside are fantastic ... from the rooms , and also from the bar at the top of the hotel ! not that anyone goes to kista for the view , but if you 're there , why not see something interesting ?the restaurant is good ; but be aware it is priced at the fine dining end of the scale .the menus are ipads .excellent breakfast buffet .like so much in sweden , the prices are outrageously high ."
27,"a good choice when in kista , this high - tower hotel has fairly fresh rooms which are quiet and comfortable .views are nice , internet is free , good working space .there is not much of "" soul "" in this hotel though , it caters more to the typical business traveler .elevators may be a bit slow at peak hours , but that is minor nuisance . </DOC> this hotel looks very fancy on the outside , but it 's in my opinion pretty regular inside the roomon the plus side the breakfast was decent , the internet connection worked as expected and the service at the reception was friendly .still , giving an average overall rating because i think this hotel is slightly overpriced .it 's a very convenient hotel to choose for sure . </DOC> a typical new modern business hotel .location great when visiting kista and literally next to the freeway to arlanda .rooms are clean and adequate but also a bit steril .great breakfast buffet which really give you a good start .the gym is as often nowadays a bit smal but is ok .a plus is the skybar with a great view of stockholm . </DOC> this hotel in the kista business district of stockholm is very good .the design is typically swedish but with some really great "" twists "" . plenty of contemporary art in the hotel .but - all of the food is cooked superbly well .the hotel is at the top end of stockholm prices , but then all hotels are expensive when compared to other european countries .welcome to scandinavia ! very proficient and friendly staff . </DOC> hotel is really great with nice design and comfortable rooms .located at 15 - 20 minutes walking from the kista subway or 5 - 10 minutes walking to the train station .breakfast is really good with plenty of options to choose .staff is helpful and nice , always smiling ( which is not so common in swedish hotels ) .the only problem at this hotel is the windows : if you want to have a nice night of sleep with a very dark room , that 's not the place .that 's the only negative point , in my opinion . </DOC> this is a relatively new hotel in a glistening tower conveniently located close to ericsson headquarters in kista .consequently business appears to be good as they have cornered the market for business travelers .unsmiling service and quirky "" technically functional but lacking warmth and comfort "" amenities are the negatives .examples include : minimal number ofsomewhat thin , almost threadbare , towels , insufficient number of cardio machines ( without tvs ! ) , etc .bottom line , they could do so much better with a little effort and a relatively small investment .bottom line you feel for the price you pay, they give you the absolute minimum they can get away with . </DOC> what i liked : - great - looking hotel , in a funky glass tower , offering good 4-star amenities . - on the motorway , halfway between arlanda airport and the center of stockholm , very convenient if you are doing business in the surrounding areas .- modern , minimalist design - spotlessly clean throughout -i like the ambience , the service was great and the food good .- great views from the sky bar on floor 34 - good breakfast offering a sufficient range of hot and cold options .- the dinner menu at the restaurant could benefit from a few more options . </DOC> if you need a place stay in this neighbourhoodthis is good hotel to stay .but it is quite functional .hotel is relatively new and thus clean and well kept .top floor bar worth visiting for views ."
28,"my room was fine and staff were greatbut as i arrived by taxi ( albeit after a day of hospitality at chester races )i was greeted with a building site .in the early hours i stumbled across some scaffold planks in near darkness to stumble across reception .i am aware that the hotel is entirely within their rights to extend but felt that they should take better care of their guests whilst undertaking the works . </DOC> we stayed here as part of a visit to the area .it has everything you would expect of a premier inn , nice clean rooms , comfortable beds , good shower , easy access to breakfast etc .what sets this pi aside from many of the others is the staff , who could not have been more helpful and friendly , going out of their way and spending a lot of time with us to give us tourist information , maps , suggested things to do etc . </DOC> we arrived to a frosty receptionist at 2 pm before we could say can we leave our bagsshe said your room is not ready until 3 pm which we knew having stayed at many premier inns .we were kept awake all night by people walking around in the room above us problem with floor boards i was told .then we were woken again very early by the building site next door </DOC> pros - good sized car park , usual premier welcome , room in new extensionso pretty prestine and up to standard .had some little niggles with the brewers fayre next doorbut just the usual inability of these places to cope with busy saturday evening rush .however food and breakfast were good enough , just a few service standards not up to scratch , if the folk we meet in a premier inn reception can always get it right , why ca n't the adjoining pubs / restaurants ? </DOC> stayed here for one night recently working in little sutton which is less than a mile away so very handily places for me .excellent receptionist , very helpful and efficient .rooms very clean and comfortable with everything required for a comfortable stay .food in next door restaurant is standard pub fare and adequate and this is where breakfast is next day .plenty of parking available . recommended . </DOC> just like most premier inns the bed was comfy , bathroom spacious , tv quite largeand it felt that this was new or refurbished as the decor appeared fresh .it could be a struggle .i did n't eat or drink here .the location is peaceful and there 's ample parking . </DOC> stayed one night and found it excellent .staff on reception were helpful and very friendly .room was clean and fresh and very comfortable .the surroundings were really nice too .would stay again .this premier inn is one of the nicest i have stayed in and would recommend to friends . </DOC> so if you arrive late and hungry you will find nothing for you other than a trip to local pubs .the rooms have been refurbished and are clean but quite small compared to modern prenier inns , ditto the bathroom , towells smelt of chemicals .staff were friendly enough and breakfast was fine .noise from doors will disturb and the walls are paper thin .they now charge top prices so quality should match"
29,"had a stopover on way to ferry .room quite basic .bed a bit firm .bathroom appears to have been modernised since last stay ( please note premier inn toilet roll is a bit better / classy than sheets ) .lady at reception was very friendly and helpful by getting us extra pillows .travelled from london by car and arrived at 11 pm .bit disappointed bar was closed on a friday night .good that premier inn have introduced free wifi .it done the job for a night , but would n't stay much longer . </DOC> although finding your way around this sprawling hotel is tricky at first , it 's a great place to stay overall .we were initially a bit overwhelmed with the amount of buildings which make up the hotel complex , not helped by the hidden reception and the fact our room was in a separate building , but once we got our bearings this quickly passed .our room ( in the new building ) is the newest premier inn room we ' ve ever stayed in and was rather nice indeed .although it had the same comfy bed and similar furniture , there was also a new tv which plays well with mobile phones - a great addition .great hotel all in aall with a handy location for cheshire oaks and chester zoo , just a bit bigger than normal ! </DOC> the reception staff were friendly , helpful and efficient .the rooms were comfortable and had everything we needed .the hotel is very easily accessible from the motorway and located in quite a pleasant area .we also like to visit the garden centre next door .the only disappointment for us , is that like so many premier inns we have stayed in recently , the ever dropping standards of the adjacent brewers fayre lets it down .whereas previously we would just nip down to the brewers fayre , we now have to find somewhere else reasonable to eat . as it happened , the reception staff suggested the white lion ( 5 minutes walk ) , which we found to be an excellent pub . </DOC> and we were delighted with our choice - and not too expensive .hotel had a new block and old , both had rooms that were spotlessly clean and comfortable .next to it , about three yards away , was the entrance to the adjoining pub / restaurant .not too busy and just the job for food and/ or drink .the entrance to the site is shared by burleydam garden centre which was worth a looklots of free parking , feels secure - and they even left us sheetsfinally , the staff .how brilliant were they .sarah on reception was charming , informative , hugely helpful and made us feel so important .the morning we left there was a charming young man on the desk who actually seemed to really care about our stay and our journey home .top class both of them - and a breath of fresh air . </DOC> good access , clean modern rooms , pleasant helpful staff , good size carpark , well lit .good access from m53 .spent two nights here on business and can not fault it , the adjoining restaurant / pub does get very busy as there is a childrens indoor play area , so it 's best to book a table upon arrival .will stay again . </DOC> was very impressed on the drive up to this premier inn as even though it has a pubit 's in a great peaceful location .we stayed in the new building which has the new updated premier inn rooms which are just fantastic and make a real difference when you stay in a lot of premier inns .just the new updated dark coloured furniture and mood lights ( all purple of course ) add that little extra something .ideally situated and close to motorway links , we would definitely stay here again . </DOC> only a one night stay , but up to usual standards in welcome and room facilities . </DOC> stayed here for just one night and everything was great .it was spotlessly clean , the room maybe a little smaller than usual but more than adequate , good tv , very comfortable bed and good bathroom .the staff on reception were the usual friendly staff you find at premier inn compared to other ' budget ' hotels and they were very helpful .the grounds of the hotel are also very nice and welcoming .it was perfect for a one night stay away ."
30,"typical premier inn - - we booked in advance otherwise the rates are not competitive - the location was very handy for us and the fact that it has the new rooms was also a factor - we were in the back of the hotel in the extensionthe room was small and the bathroom pokey - must be the smallest premier inn room that we have stayed in . </DOC> it was lovely and spotlessly clean .standard premier inn comfy bed , great pillows could n't ask for anything more we all slept well .the attached pub we visited for a drink on the evening but did n't fancy the food we walked 5 minutes or so to a local indian restaurant had a fabulous meal .and it was lovely .we stayed because we visited chester zoo one day and then cheshire oaksthe next location was perfectwould definitely stay again . </DOC> prompt check in and made to feel very welcome , was also offered help with luggage to room , which was on the 1st floor ( no lift here ,room serviced every day with freah clean towels .breakfast good evening meals & sevice really needs to be looked into ,hooton train station is 3 minute drive £ 1 all day parking , 35 minutes to liverpool & 15 minutes to chester .this pi is a good choice for cheshire oaks desinger outlet , and chester zoo .i would stay here againbut i would not eat at the brewers fayre </DOC> stayed here in july when we were touring england and must say it was much better than some 5star hotels we stayed at , incredible value for money , staff excellentalways happy had a long chat with one of the chefsand he was brilliant everyone had time to talk ,food good and rooms up to their normal standard will definitely return </DOC> stayed here on a sunday night , arrived late so did n't eat in the restaurant .location is close to the m53 but not so close that you hear any motorway noise .my room was a good size , the usual very comfortable premier inn bed , kettle , tv etcthe bathroom was small but perfectly functional , and very clean and smart .good sized towels , powerful shower and good lighting !breakfast was the usual premier inn offering , although i ' ve had better at other premier inns ( and worse ) </DOC> the rooms are nice and comfortable with a large tv , comfortable bed , and even a bath which was a nice surprise .there is free wifi ( and a paid faster option ) , plenty of parking and a restaurant / pub .what makes this place special is the staff .i unfortunately do n't remember the receptionist 's name :( ( young lady with blond hair ) , but she was welcoming , very helpful and nothing was too much trouble .some other big hotel chains could learn something about customer service from her :-)the location is great and has easy access to the m53 motorway .the village of little sutton is nearby , and that has a range of shops , takeaways , pubs .there is also a a garden centre next door and the brewers fare pub , both of which have food .but i was lucky in that most of them remained quiet or stopped in the evening . </DOC> hotel with a nice attached food option .very handy for all of the wirral 's surprisingly many & varied attractions .the staff were friendly & helpful & the room comfortable , clean & well appointed .the hotel entrance is tucked round the back of the brewers faye pub .use the rear car - park to be near the hotel entrance . </DOC> stayed here for one night and it was a very comfortable stay .the room was well equip with enough plug sockets , tv , mirror , tea and coffee making facilities , a desk , space to hang up you clothes , hair drying facilities , a fan , a really good on - suite and a really comfortable bed as ever .the staff were very friendly and helpful ."

32,"coco reef continues to maintain its position as a charming hotel with staff who provide a good standard of service and food .those considering a stay here need to understand that the positives of location of the hotel , close to the airport and with a beautiful private man - made lagoon for swimming in , tempered against a hotel that is quaint and pretty but does require some upgrading to meet today visitors needs .i do recommend this hotel expect the room facilities and decor to be the same as when i first visited 10 years ago ! </DOC> our fourth visit to the coco reef , and the hotel is still good .there 's always room for improvement , and the management recognise this and have been very busy with the paint brushes and refurbishing the beach equipment !this beautiful hotel seems to divide reviewers , with some very negative comments balanced by many positives from repeat guests .is it the best hotel in the caribbean ?is it a comfortable , relaxed , beach - front hotel in a good location ?good points:- - location - size - responsive management - facilities - beach - warm welcome areas for improvement:- - roomsfeel dated ( particularly bathroom and availability of power points ) .but are clean and well maintainedexpensive and unreliable negative points:- - lunch buffet choice has reduced - reception staff are either under - trained or not interested in customer service will we go back ? </DOC> recently stayed at this super hotel , in glorious suroundings .nothing was too much trouble for the fabulous staff who we had the pleasure of seeeing each day .everything was clean , and replenished , you could'nt wish for a better hotel .many thanks for our wonderful stay with you ,oh and the food was excellent </DOC> coco reef is the only decent hotel in crown point ( the whole island only has 2000 beds ) , and the private beach just makes it feel so exclusive .coco reef has all the amenities you would want - the resident ' undersea tobago ' dive school is very good .the serving staff are typically caribbean - but the reception staff and management are fine , and the two ladies in the tour office were just great .there is lot of rotting wood and rusting roof visible andthe décor of the rooms comes right out of a 1980 's soap opera .coco reef just needs some tlc and they could easily justify the prices they charge -e.g. wifi is expensive ( and slow ) and only covers the lobby area .that said i would go back, we liked tobago and as a base coco reef is fine . </DOC> we first stayed here for 8 nights on a kuoni package back in march 2004 when we were totally bowled over by the place - it was our first experience of such an exotic location , and gave us many treasured memories .we always said we would love to go back to the coco reef one day , although as time passed bywe found ourselves disappointed , however , the opportunity to pay a brief visit en route to grenada proved too tempting , hence a 3-night stay here in mid - april .the transfer from the airport seemed even shorter than i remember it - you could walk it in 10 minutes if travelling light .being so close to the airport </DOC> i am never disappointed with my visits to coco reef .the staff are so great and welcoming that i feel as if i am going to stay with friends .but the overall experience is worth the visit . </DOC> this hotel should be fantastic .it is within easy walking distance of other restaurants , shops , pigeon point and the airport , so no long transfer journey , and is situated in a lovely position above a shallow lagoon with sandy beaches within the hotel grounds , all shaded by palm trees which give some shelter from the regular showers .there are three dining areas , a bar and a separate pool , 10 ' depth , above the beach in a patio setting overlooked on three sides by part of the accommodation .there are plenty of sun loungers around the pool and on the beaches .so the hotel was being somewhat disingenuous .in both rooms , the ensuite bathrooms are of adequate size with shower over low bath , large mirrors , but they are dated . </DOC> i must stress i did not stay as a guest in this hotel we used the beach facilitiesi would say the hotel beach is one of my favourites the beach is tidy and the sand well maintained the views from the beach are marvellous especially early morning 😀"
33,"there is something quite charming about this hotel .the service is not always brilliant and there is a fair bit of teeth sucking , but there are lots of exceptions - such as the lovely lady at the egg station in the morning , the girls at the beach bar , natasha adams who is a star .on the whole the staff are very well intentionedbut we got the impression that they lacked experience and maybe needed a little more guidanceand this did not distract from our enjoyment of our holiday at coco reef .we went half board which was a first for us , and i am glad that we did as the only other places to eat locally seemed to be fast food places which did not appeal .breakfast is good with lots of fresh fruit , choice of cereal , bacon , sausages etc and the amazing egg woman .and it might be a good idea to have two egg stations . </DOC> close to airportbut you do not hear any noise a nice welcome with a cool drink , a fast smooth check in , we were shown to room 139 very spacious with 2 large double beds and terrace over looking the sea.a very quiet end of the hotel which was nice .the room was clean but the bathroom needs an update with poor shower over the bath and a shower curtain which had seen better days .the beach and lagoon is perfect , shallow and so clearyou could see all the colourful fish easily , great snorkelling with borrowed equipment from the dive centre at the end of the beach.my husband used the dive centre and they were great .there is plenty of shadethe staff were all nice and do a good job butnot overly engaging .nice touch of drinks brought to you on the beach at eleven and fruit . </DOC> we stayed at the coco reef hotel from 24th march for 2 weeks , and i can only say that the staff were the best i have come across in any hotel or resort for a long time !the guest services people keva and andrea were truly wonderful , and did everything to make our holiday more pleasant .what a lovely touch !the tips i would offer to prospective visitors would be :remember that you can pretty well ask for anything you want food - wise , and they will probably oblige .lastly approach the local people with a smile and you will find that they are the kindest and most accomodating people you could meet . </DOC> but overall it is very well maintained .the staff is what makes the place great ! from the time we booked , checked in - stayed and left - the staff was simply amazing .the service is slower at night in the downstairs restaurant / barbut it is a place where you can get away with wearing shorts .i would say the only real challenge for some maybe the lack of a / c in the dinning areas .the private lagoon they have is awesome and all kinds of really cool fish are right at your feet .your stay covers free snorkels , masks , and kyachts . </DOC> one of the other guests who were staying at the coco reef when we were there described it as a marmite hotel , you either love it or hate it .we stayed for two weeks in october and it exceeded our expectations .the staff from the maintenance people to the senior management are focussed on customer satisfaction .the food in the restaurant is high quality , the service friendly and efficient . </DOC> this was my family 's second stay in two years .location is the best asset of this hotel situated mere minutes from the airport and famous pigeon point and storebay beaches .all rooms / suites provide luxurious garden or beach views .the private beach provides safety and awesome sunset views .one can snorkel and participate in other water sport activities on site .the spa is also excellent !room service and bar rates are affordable and timely .i will be more than willing to return again . </DOC> i originally booked a different hotel but decided to change due to the location of coco reef .it is in a great location and very convenient to the airport .we arrived late from the us to tobago but knowingly asked for a ride from the airport to the hotel .the hotel set this up and it was costly at $ 100 for a half mile ride but not knowing the area we booked the transfer .we arrived and walked out and waited , and waited and waited .no driver , no sign , no nothing .i tried to call and finally got through and was told a driver was on the way .knowing that the hotel is half a mile away , one would have thought that the car would arrive quickly .a mini van- for 4 adults , 2 children and 5 days of luggage .great plan coco reef .check in was again slow- </DOC> we stayed here from 9th - 24th feb .as you drive up the long palm lined driveway , i must admit the building is very impressive and grand .the food at breakfast was great , lots of variety and great service ."
34,"the arrival at crown point airport is somewhat chaotic and feels non too friendly .it is also rather tatty .however the welcome at the hotel ( which is within walking distance ! ) could not be faulted .it is approached by a tree lined private road surrounded by well maintained gardens .was well organised and friendly .our room was clean , well maintained and comfortable .all staff were friendly and nothing was too much trouble .the nice part was being served a meal in the evening rather than rushing round a self service buffet .the beach and enclosed lagoon make a quiet , safe , secluded bay to relax in and waiters are on hand with drinks and juicy fruit .the dive school goes out daily and is tailored to experience . </DOC> we stayed here for 7 nights and my first impression was wow what a lovely beach and view .you can snorkel in the bay and there are so many fishes - just beautiful .the sunsets were stunning .our room was ok .the bed was comfythe shower was excellent .we had a fridge and a small seating area area outside ( although not keen on sitting opposite the pool ) .and it was delicious .so this was perfect .some staff were so helpful and friendlythis was particularly noticed at breakfast or when serving us drinks in the lobby area .the customer service was not all negative .the waiter who works on the beach asking if we needed drinks was friendly and helpful .the chaps at the dive shop were super helpful .thanks to housekeeping who always kept our room clean despite us bringing in lots of sand . </DOC> everything about this hotel is perfect .the friendly well trained staff .the attention to detail .the food and service were second to none .everyone at this hotel went out of their way to remedy anything that would spoil your holiday .the location is one of the best in the caribbean that i have visited .the beautiful lagoon sheltered a well maintained sandy beach .the bedrooms and the bathrooms in particular are tired and need to be refurbished .i was also not very happy that an extra charge was levied to use your own wifi equipment .this is so old fashioned and ‘ not on ’ in this day and age .whilst i was unhappy about the prospect of having to pay extra for wifi , the free use of internet ready terminals in the reception area made up for this . </DOC> we were astonished at the less than five minute transfer to the coco reef from the airport and yet as other reviewers had mentioned , we were never aware of aircraft noise , even on the odd occasion when we could see a flight coming in low over the sea .arriving at the very impressive entrance gates and then walking into the huge reception foyer confirmed our opinion that we were going to enjoy staying here .the bed was large and very comfortable , we had a choice of two televisions , one at the end of the bed and one in our sitting area , the air conditioning was extremely efficient and the bathroom a good size and well equipped . </DOC> watered down carib in a plastic beaker and watered down coke is never a good startbut it did set the tone and we should have left at this point .moving to bottled carib was a good move and this tasted much better .the food was barely edible - the chicken tikka and baby leaf spinach club sandwich was neither fish nor fowl but foul to taste .still not sure if it was supposed to be hot or cold .lukewarm ( at best )french fries all served with a snarl .not a good experience .goats cheese sandwich was actually raw slab mozzarella again barely edible .having only been to 9 other caribbean islands does n't allow us to say this was up there as one of the worst but does allow us to say that this place is not indicative of the caribbean .certainly not the experience we have had at other restaurants in tobago . </DOC> the staff were interested in serving us , the drinks were affordable and you could help yourself to peanuts and fried plants tain chips .we were there at sunset and it was so quiet and very pleasant ! </DOC> friendly staff , great location but hotel needs some updating to compete . considered by most locals as the best hotel in tobagobut we also stayed at the blue waters inn which was much more modern following a refurbishment .excellent lagoon for swimmers , ideal for kids and reasonable snorkelling .rooms and general decor need some updating but they are clean and functional .great walk to pigeon point which is a beautiful park and beech right next door .went on the island girl catamaran trip which was a great day out . </DOC> staff were generally pleasent although there was a little ' caribbean atitude ' from some .the grounds are generally attractive , beach small and narrow with the ' lined up ' beds & brollies .not quite sure about the rather naff bad quality ' greek ' naked lady statues everywhere ! !my suite , although large on two levels with fridge & tv was very dark .bathroom was basic , tired with a shower curtain a couple inches above the bath .cleaning of the room seemed to be ' as they felt on the day ' did not appreciate being ' moved along ' in the bar one evening to accomadate some wedding guests !out of choicei would nt stay here again"
35,"the staff were delightful , the room was generous with a lovely outlook over the garden .it was great fun wandering to the restaurant via the wine cellar and along a series of corridors .the pool looked inviting , the parking was well placed .but the crockery and decor were outstanding suggesting dining might be a treat .breakfast with the smell of fresh baked crossiants that tasted even better was a perfect way to start the day . </DOC> main reason to stay in hotel is to have a good night sleep and this did not happen .apart from that the hotel was set in beautiful gardens , free parking in the rear , great swimming pool and sauna etcwifi absolutely hopeless even near the reception .the male owner very nice but his wife we found to be very aloof .breakfast was excellent and dined there one night and was excellent .and we are australians use to heat ! ! ! </DOC> we had heard that the restaurant at this hotel should be fabulous .the breakfast was nothing short of fantastic .our room was clean , comfortable and had an interesting mix of very old architecture and ultra modern furniture ( e.g. beds ) .amenities include pool , gym and spa facilities .within a two minute walk from la malle poste , you will find the majority of rochefort 's restaurants . </DOC> this a very comfortable hotel which is well placed in the centre of rochefort .lovely staff and the room we had was well appointed - the shower was fab .but there are lots of alternatives in the town nearby .free parking in the area behind the hotel was a bonus . </DOC> if you are traveling through belgium or visiting the ardennes , this is a superb place to stay .wonderful wine cellar , bar and terrace in summer .the food is what you 'd expect in belgium , marvellous .secure parking and an indoor pool complete this excellent hotel . </DOC> stayed at la malle poste for 3 nights whilst having a short break in the ardennes .rochefort is an excellent centre to explore the lesse valley , the famous grotte de han is close by and there are various activities available in the area .the main part of the hotel containing the restaurant is very old and tastefully decorated .the restaurant served wonderful food , both at dinner and breakfast .outside are some well maintained gardens where you can have a drink in the sun .the down side is that although the room rate was very reasonable the food and drink are very pricey .if you feel like a little luxury well worth it . </DOC> the food here is outstanding the best i have ever eaten .good location in the centre of the town opposite a large church glad to say they turn the chimes off at night .good parking at the rear of the hotel , lovely gardens , swimming pool gym etc .good location for visiting battle of the bulge war sites . </DOC> booked this as a stop over between venice and calais - only 10 minute from the motorwaywas a large garden suite for 3 but would accommodate 4 on double sofa bed breakfastwas excellent - lovely omelette and fresh bread staff were accommodating of my poor french and spoke excellent english price is higher than had been used to in italy - not a cheap stop over at e280 for the room for 3 and drinks quite expensive -but i knew that when booking and not complaining - seemed nice town too and would have been worth spending some time at the hotel if we had n't needed to leave early for the ferry - 3 hours to calais"
36,"after a day of exploring the local area we dropped by without booking .the service could have been a little friendlier and upon being seated we were given a table for 4 people practically in the doorway entrance to the restaurant .we asked to move , but were told we could not by the waiter .the whole meal we were left to feel a little uncomfortable , even though there were three sections to the restaurant and free tables . upon having travelled through belgium for a weekwe were also surprised at the lack of english spoken given working in the tourism industry . </DOC> let me begin by outlining all the positives that the hotel has to offer .hotel la malle post is ideally situated in the centre of town and the large car park is at the rear .the hotel garden and patio area is delightful and an ideal place in which to relax over a drink or a bite to eat .there is also a decent sized indoor swimming pool and a spa area .breakfast was served in a beautiful room and was excellent , with a good selection of fruit , breads and pastries , meats and cheese .the service was at the table by a charming young lady and the bacon and eggs were cooked to order by the duty chef . </DOC> as per previous reviews this is a quirky family hotel with narrow stars and small rooms filled with the owners treasures .the pool looked good and the terrace lawn is great for a long tall drink in the sun .the breakfast is expensive for the selection but what you get is adequate and good quality .but we were quite sternly told by who wr assumed to be the lady ownerit was closed and to go awaybut you still need to lock your bikes upand it is difficult to push them in over gravel . </DOC> this is the best hotel to stay when you are in this area .no airco and the rooms near the street can be noisy .but overal , the room isn´t the best part , but the staff , the kitchen and the terrace are !had to be there for three days and every meal is excellent , breakfast , lunch or dinner ...the owners and their staff are doing everthing that make you feel at home .the garden is beautiful and the hotel has a very nice indoor pool and gym .however without airco in the summer , you better jog outside in the surroundings of rochefort .could be nice in winter during xmas with the family . </DOC> this is a wonderfully atmospheric hotel , with superb facilities .the restaurant serves an excellent dinner .my room was up in the roof , low ceiling and quirky but extremely comfortable and clean .the staff were friendly , helpful and professional .i would not hesitate to stay here again . </DOC> the great things : the hotel is amazingly gorgeous .it is right across the street from the huge church , so you ca n't miss it .the bed was soooo comfortable .thee bathroom was clean and had a jacuzzi tub .there was free parking at the hotel .the hotel gardens are lovely !breakfast is delicious with cooked - to - order eggs and really great coffee .the one thing that really took away from our stay and makes me give the hotel 4 stars instead of 5 is how ridiculously hot the room was .i still highly recommend the hotel and have encouraged my friends to visit there .we will return again . </DOC> restaurant at the evening is rather expensive but quality is fine .breakfast is very good , fresh products of high quality , to recommend .rooms are nice and clean but very noisy , you can hear literally everything what the neighbor is saying .a small but clean indoor pool and sauna plenty of parking available staff speaks en / for / dutch in the city center , close to bars and restaurants and very good to go for a walk in the nature </DOC> the entrance to the room escorted by a staff member was fun to go through the vin de caves - but mind your head .fortunately there are 2 other easier entrances through the garden terrace or a door from the front street .our garden room was gorgeously sunny and looked out on the lovely garden terrace - great spot for a drink in the sunshine .the restaurant looked lovely but was formal and very expensive - cheap casual and fun bella italia is next door with great pasta and pizza - get a table by the big back window .couple of good boulangeries open from 7.30 am for a much cheaper and better continental breakfast than paying 15e in hotel ."
37,"we stayed here for 2 nights and found the hotel great , the staff were really helpful on places to visit in the area and the rooms were clean and tidy , i would definitely recommend staying here if you want to see the wildlife as its near ponies , cows and donkey 's </DOC> this is a good premier inn ... it does what it says on the tin ! !but this one is fine .the room was large , plenty of room in the carpark and the breakfast was goodfood was hot and plentiful and the staff were pleasant and helpful .. i would stay here again .it is handy for the new forest and sightseeingbut there is nothing in hordle itself </DOC> my first impression was of a sterile appearance to the room , but once settled in , i found it to be well designed and thought out .the flat screen tv has all its connections beside the desk – easy to connect you tablet / laptop .there is a hair dryer under a small make up table with a big mirror beside the wardrobe .this makes it easy to look close up , and stops the bathroom being hogged .the room heating worked well and was simple to operate .the window opened to allow you fresh air in the room –the only downside we found was that the kettle gave the water an unpleasant plastic taste – management please note and fix .i must say the bed was comfy and spotless with a good duvet , butnot quite the super luxury implied in the tv adverts ! </DOC> this place looks like all other premier inns as you would expect .the location is very nice , down plenty of a and b roads that leads you to a vastly extended old inn that is now a premier inn .rooms nice , clean , tidy and well - appointed .food in the restaurant was the usual premier inn fare , nothing exciting but of a consistent quality .breakfast we very good , all freshly cooked with two fried eggs at perfection .the location of this place in the new forest makes it an ideal weekend touring base of the local countryside and museums . will probably use this place next time we are down that way . </DOC> i expected bargain basement standard , but the standard was very high ., i would really recommend this hotel as a base for exploring the local area . </DOC> the rooms are perfect , and you are guaranteed a good night 's sleep .however our stay was really spoilt this time by poor service at breakfast time .the staff were obviously not prepared for the number of guests at breakfast ( why not ? ) and were rushed off their feet .we had to ask for coffee as it had run out , ask for juice , ask for bread etc then queue for ten minutes to make toast on the one small toaster .i had pre - ordered a cooked breakfastbut after 50 minutes it had still not arrived so i asked for my money back and left still hungry . </DOC> the hotel was as i come to expect with premier inn , large room , clean and comfortable .check - in was easy and anna was very helpful .the restaurant though was not such a good experience .i was amazed to be told there was a 40 minute wait ?as this hotel is ' a little isolated ' i had little choicethe staff they do have are friendly and helpful and always seem extremely busy - so no criticism is directed to them .i must point out that the food when it came was nice and tasty , it 's just the length of time that 's needed when using the restaurant that is not so good .at breakfast i was looked after by adam and received a friendly welcome and good service .the breakfast too was excellent food . </DOC> the first time i stopped there was about 4 years ago when it first opened and everything was all fresh and new .the staff were really helpful in the hotel , and the room was excellent and clean with big flat sceen tv as well . plenty of teas and coffees on request .the attached resturant / pub was fineand if you have a meal before 6.30pm it is very cost effective ( 2 for £ 10.00 ) so really handy if you do want a drink and do not want to drive .but it was then sorted out by the very apologetic manager ,so ok in the end .location is a bit odd with nothing to see or do within short walking distance , but otherwise really handy for a short break in the rest off the new forest area .lymington only 5 mins away by car ."
38,"good hotel as you would expect from premier inn , clean and comfortable , friendly receptionist .only issue is it 's location , slap bang in the middle of nowhere !if visiting for pleasure no doubt this is an advantagebut if you want to get to southampton it seems to take forever ! </DOC> bathroom all worked well and was in good condition .hotel staff were friendly , plenty of free parking , all was as expected .... not massively impressed with the brewers fayre associated with it , which i will cover separately . </DOC> a small hotel with only 20 beds excellent place to stay if you are going to beaulieu motor museum or the new forest .we received a very warm welcome and our room was on the ground floor with easy access as i am disabled .the food in the evening was good pub grub but the breakfast was outstanding very hot and made fresh , i understand why premier inns do buffet style breakfast but cooked fresh is best .i would return if only for breakfast . </DOC> location is in hordle which is n't lymington ....the hotel is old but the rooms are renovated .towels were changed daily and housekeeping good .car park was a bit potholed thou and there seems to be a farm yard / field or something throu a gate at the rear .looked like staff quarters with washing in the window .quality of sleep and room comfort good .detachable shower head </DOC> the premier inn in lymington makes an excellent base when visiting friends and family in the area .there is loads of free parking , the rooms and spacious , clean and comfortable and without exception the reception staff are all friendly and helpful .but the receptionist was very apologetic and sorted us out with extra towels etc .breakfast is served in the adjoining restaurant , we went for the continental option and were really pleased with the wide choice available .even if you are hungry it is easy to fill up on croissants , toast and cereals from the buffet .other guests seemed to have a long wait for the cooked breakfast option .if you do nt want to get back in the car and drive to a restaurant you can have dinner in the brewers fayre next door , the food is unexceptional pub grub but the service is quick and friendly . </DOC> having stayed here before for a family visit it made sense to stay here again .but it was sorted out by the staff .the code for the wifi did n't work , but again the staff did sort this out .the biggest gripe are the scripted staff , especially the breakfast staff .it all feels a bit false and a bit irritating .we would stay there again if we can get the cheap deal , but next time i might plan ahead and stay in a b&b for some genuine human conversationif for nothing else . </DOC> this hotel is in a good location , rooms are spacious and clean .but it is let down by both the quality of the restaurant ( including breakfast ) and the unfortunately the staff who are n't able to cope with the smallest of technical hitches .i would still recommend staying here , but eat elsewhere .premier inn offer a good nights sleep or your money back , however this makes staff someone sensitive to even a minor query / critique , automatically jumping the defence .this policy perhaps needs to be reconsidered ....i 'd did n't have a good nights sleep , which i wo n't bore you withbut neither could i be bothered to explain in detail at checkout . </DOC> good size free parking and bar / restaurant attached .staff friendly and helpful . great location to stay to explore the new forest"
39,"so was n't expecting a lot bed was shocking a very old sprung bedand you could feel all the springs no sound proofingso you could hear a lot no heatingso when i woke up this morning it was freezing to summarise the type of people this is suitable for was clearly highlighted at breakfast when trades men wore there hivis clothing for breakfast . </DOC> that is a good point because it is n't a place that pretends to be a 4 star hotel nor one which is a hostel .it is situated on the high street of the town , which is very convenient , it is also something you should not worry about if you worry about traffic noise for brackleyhas a bypass going round it andthe high street is very quiet ( and quite quaint ) for a modern small town .my room was nice and quite traditionally decorated .this was good but the room was looking a bit tired .so full marks here .yes food is available either in the bar or in the restaurant area .my grumble would be the poor choice of food .i opted for a cheese and onion sandwich in the bar , which cam with small salad and chips ; which was very nice . </DOC> the poor bar man was treated like something out of fawlty towers .however the room was clean and comfortable it was close to silverstone , so it served it purpose .not somewhere you would recommend to the family . </DOC> dropped in for lunch on the day of the motorcycle festival but actually abandoned the idea as the queues for drinks were tremendous .we did manage to find a table in the courtyard out back for drinks , prices were fine butthe wine was atrocious .. pure vinegar !not sure if this is what is usually served ot if it was reserved for the biking fraternity .. nevertheless , not somewhere we would visit again . </DOC> reception staff very helpful and welcoming .the room was spacious and clean but just looked a bit tired .however , the bed was very comfortable .meal from a pleasant but unadventurous menu was well cooked and again the service was efficient and friendly .the restaurant lacked atmosphere but a typically quiete monday evening probably contributed significantly to this .breakfast was ok . plus point was waiter service except for juices / cereals .downside was slight confusion - arrived without eggs ( they were ordered ) and was then returned a little luke warm .overall a pleasant old world place to stay in this attractive little town butwould be so much better with some tlc and a bit more attention to detail .however , very good value . </DOC> for £ 100 a night for a double room , this hotel is poor .run down , dirty , dated , mismatched furniture , wallpaper ( peeling and stained ) on the ceiling , walls that have been painted with no care at all .i could go on ...the welcome on check in was non existent .although we had given credit card details on booking , we were told by the very brusque member of staff that we had to pay on check in .i ' ve never stayed anywhere where you ' ve had to do thatbut then this was the sort of odd place that hands you a remote control for the tv at the same time ! !clearly the usual clientele steal them ? ! if you can , i 'd advise you to stay elsewhere . </DOC> we found our room okbut in need of redecoration .the shower was fine , nice and hot just what we needed after walking all day .the meal we had in the evening was fine and the service was good .plenty for breakfast in the morning and more than enough to choose from .if we are around here again we would stay at the crown . </DOC> i was allocated room 12 which overlooks the staff smoking area , they also appear to socialise there .terrible view on old furniture and rubbish .the room is was very basic , no phone , sockets hanging off the wall .it could really do with deep clean .bathroom leaves a lot to be desired , dirty , shower needs to be replaced .breakfast was cold including the hot water to make tea .i guess you get what you pay for .if i was staying more than one night i would have checked out and gone else where ."
40,"yes it probably needed a lick of paint to freshen up the walls , but it was clean , has a hospitality tray and my bed was comfortable enough .i ate in the bar and had very nice liver and bacon which was a bargain at £ 7.95 ....the bacon looked like it had been poached , the sausages needed cooking some more , the fried eggs looked more like scrambled ages and sat in grease .i declined and went for the continental option .the mini croissants were poor and the sweet waffles similarly unappetising .both had obviously come out of cheap packets would i return ? at a push yes if working in the area again .but not for a weekend stay with the wife </DOC> we had a brilliant evening .katherina was absolutely brilliant .the food was excellent and katherina ensured that the food was put out as agreed .the building is a lovely old coaching inn .we would definately have no hesitation in using this venue again . </DOC> ( in the past the crown was a comfortable , if somewhat higgledy - piggledy place , with staff that clearly knew and took a pride in their jobs ; it was ‘ the place ’ for any kind of function , and it was , simply , where people stayed if they went to brackley . )when i booked i had n’t even twigged that the crown was n’t quoting any tourist accreditation rating on its website , although google quotes it as being 3-star ; i have since checked on visit england and the northants tourist board websites and could n’t find the crown , meaning it probably has no star rating at all at present . </DOC> i expected the price to be inflated and it was which is fair for this weekend .the staff in general are excellent very friendly and great customer service skills .however the hotel is dirty and very unkept .breakfast was almost inedible , what is almost as concerning is the total denial by the management when we complained .they just do n't accept there is a problem .never never again </DOC> need more staff .waited ages to check in parking is a problem assume that you will have to pay to park if your lucky enough to get a spot it will be a bonus .ok radiator was on and hot but room was not cold but not hot .nice log fire in bar .a buffet wish was ok .checkout was quick.would stop again . </DOC> the buffet was very good with plenty of food .the room was clean .plenty of tea and coffee .plenty of hot water . perfectly adequate . </DOC> we called in here for a coffee and bar - snack .the coffee was good & the menu not bad but nothing out of the ordinary .there was a huge helping of salad with the potato which was fairly unnecessary & the peas i was given were like bullets , not sure how many times they 'd been cooked .the service was reasonable , the staff friendly .the decor looked as if it needed a good makeover , it was quite shabby .when i visited the ladies i found 2 out of the 3 toilets were out of order .this place needs a lot of tlc to bring it up to a decent standard . </DOC> my room was quite attractive in an old fashioned way .the bed was comfortable .big kettle and drink sachets including hot chocolate which i appreciated but very small cups .bathroom was fine , small sachets of gel were left for your use .the staff were friendly and tried to please .the room was warm .a warning though, it was by the main roadso it is quite noisy and the two large windows do not block out the light of the streetlamps .it is a shame breakfast was so unenjoyable .there was a choice of only 3 cereals and the bread was cheap .the water for drinks was lukewarm .the cooked food looked so unappetising that i did n't eat it .there were some nice small pastries .this could be made into such a nice hotel , i hope things can be improved ."

42,"so i can keep drinks and snacks on hand for my week - long trips to the area for work .the hyatt house has the added bonus of being in a town center development with many shops and restaurants within walking distance .parking is free , but can be a little difficult on weekend evenings when there are many visitors to the center .the hotel itself is in pristine condition .the lobby is modern and bright , restaurant area is clean and quiet , and the rooms are small , but nicely decorated with modern furnishings .my room was on the top floor and while the view was lovely , the walk up the stairwell was not my favorite thing after a long day of driving around the area .still , the staff attempted to be accommodating and maintained their friendly demeanor despite what i must imagine was constant complaining from guests . </DOC> this is a very nice , upscale hotel with an excellent staff .the room was very clean , and it had super nice furnishings .the suite was on the smaller size as far as suites go , but plenty large enough for a couple .the free breakfast is very good , and there is free parking on the 2nd floor of a parking garage across the small street .hotel is very eco - friendly , but very bad for smokers with no good place to smoke outside .it is in a new district full of great restaurants and high - end stores within just one to three blocks .for example , there is no airport shuttle . </DOC> this my 2nd time visit , i stay in this hotel as the location very good closed to shopping area and food place and movie plus 15 minutes walk to metro and 10 minutes drive to airport , and close to drive washington dc , </DOC> it is nice hotel new opener thingsstill new , the staff all nice very helpi feel like home there break fast very nice the only in two day there were out of englishand they know therebut over hotel very good to stay am higher recommend, their jem very nice , my last </DOC> anyway , this hotel is very nice , it 's not a large full service hotel , but they offer almost all the amenities you might need .my room was very nice , i ' mthe bed was very comfortable and all the services in the room were nice as well .i did not use the fitness center , but i was told it had most equipment people need .i did have a nice run outside and ask the receptionist for a running trail . </DOC> it looks like the houses are upscale compared to places .this property is a little hard to find , but is located on lee highway .the entrance / parking are hidden from the highway and is within a town center concept .very helpful front desk staff , quiet , tastefully decorated rooms , good internet and a delicous breakfast buffet are all partbof the package .you are surrounded ntshops and restaurants and the metro station is within walking .they have a shuttle vanbut we did n't inquire about what it offers . </DOC> very modern and clean .room is spacious .shower is enormous .plus this particular hyatt house is right in the middle of chic restaurants and shops ,literally just steps out the front door .breakfast is fantastic , a good variety of choices .staff is extremely helpful and nice , this is a winner ! </DOC> my family ( 10 yr old son and 2 small dogs ) stayed here for a few nights while house hunting in nova .everything is great about this euro - like hotel in the heart of the new ( and very trendy ) mosaic district .they were great to us and to our two little dogs .location could n't be better .wonderful restaurants walking distance , a target , and a mom 's organic market .breakfast was also first rate ! not that close to metro for anyone without a car ( we had one )but there 's probably a shuttle ."
43,"i ' ve stayed at similar hotels like the residence inn and homewood suites and the hyatt house 's seem to be consistently better in many ways .the hotel is tucked away near the mosaic mall which is very convenient .shopping and restaurants are close at hand .target is nearby so easy to stock up on food and things you might have forgotten like i did .checkin was quick and the staff very attentive and helpful .modern clean rooms with a kitchen .self serve breakfast was good with made to order omelettes .definitely on my short list when i ' m back in that area . give this 5 stars for this class of hotel . </DOC> but this was excellent .new hotel . great staff .nice location in fairfax county near metro and dulles .breakfast very good and nice lobby area and billiards .near a target and a super great vietnamese restaurant called four sisters . </DOC> the staff was very friendly , the hotel was attractive and clean , and our room was very comfortable .the complimentary breakfast is a step above most .best of all , it 's in a great location .i was chilling out while my husband was working , and i could walk out of the hotel to visit shops and restaurants .there 's a decent gym , and a small but nice pool area . </DOC> we were attending a concert at the state theatre - and this hotel was the perfect place to stay .clean , spacious , comfortable and quiet rooms - and a wonderful staff to take good care of you .parking is across the street but , even dragging suitcases , is close enough .it has a full kitchen if you need to stay a while - but is comfortable even for overnights . </DOC> this property knows how to "" be "" an hotel and it does it very well .it 's located in a new hip and upcoming shopping area that has grown - up a bit and now has a lot of things going on .this hotel was clean and fresh .the room was well appointed and has a full kitchen .wireless was good , although somewhat slow during the evening when it was probably in high use .the fitness center was clean and had free weights and a "" combo "" type machine , in addition to treadmills and other machines .i would definitely stay here again . </DOC> new means it is clean and working .these hyatt houses are really very well designed and functional ... they had a "" live "" omelette station .staff is very nice and attentive .anyway ... i assume that was a "" one off "" in an otherwise great hotel .the bar is open until 10 pm and has typical decent bar food .there is no pool - but the gymn is very nice and all new and equipment is great .so do nt expect a full service traditional hotel .but for a frequent traveller it hits the nerve .. it has everything you really need ... area is nice ... lots of midlevel bars and restaurants .. </DOC> great location near a lot of great places to eat and shopping .quick commute into dc .professional staff and nice rooms .i really had no complaints and i am extremely picky where i lay my head down to sleep . </DOC> i ' m really pleased to say that we * really * liked this hotel !it 's located in a new hip and upcoming shopping area .parking is okbut if you do n't have your own car it 's a bit of a hike to the metrothis hotel was clean and fresh .the fitness center was clean and had free weights and a "" combo "" type machine , in addition to treadmills and other machines .however , i asked one of the food staff folks if they could provide some turkey sausage and within 10 minutes we hadi would definitely stay here again ."
44,"nothing fancy at all .service and breakfast acceptable but not better .beds were a bit hard .gym : lackluster at best .do n’t use this hotel if you need a serious workout .limited amount of equipment and fee free weights to speak of . </DOC> the lodging was clean and comfortable .the hotel staff were personable and friendly .the breakfast was good .we were very busy but did catch the metro to go into dc.the metro was a 15 to 20 minutes away depending how fast you walk .i will return to this property when visiting the area . </DOC> staff is over the top friendly and reasonable .rooms and public areas are contemporary , clean and tasteful .gymn is excellent with new equipment . </DOC> the staff is super friendly , it 's clean and quiet , the wi - fi is excellent , and the breakfasts are beyond good .the beds are quite comfy and the entire place is new and modern .when you visit , be sure to look for "" bella the dog "" .she will bring a smile to your face ! ! </DOC> who would have imagined a boutique hotel in the middle of a shopping center with a target , even !outdoor movies , kids ' fountains , tons of restaurants , and a great breakfast every morning .what 's not to love ? !three days of riding the metro ( with our bicycles ) to downtown dc , walking around the area in the evening , grabbing delicacies at the farmer 's market on sunday -- it truly was a fabulous stay . </DOC> after staying at many different hotel properties in the fairfax , falls church area i confidently recommend this hotel as my favorite property .i ' ve stayed at this property four different times and always have a great experience .the hotel is convenient to many nova / dc communities and attractions .the mosaic district in which the hotel sits is full of great restaurants , movie theatre , and shopping , all a short walk from the hotel .the service is always excellent , very professional and friendly .the fitness room is modern and has good equipment .you wo n't be disappointed . </DOC> my wife and i stayed at the hyatt house for nine nights in april 2016 , and while our stay was longer term , i highly recommend this hotel for anyone needing to stay long or short - term in the vienna / falls church / fairfax area of virginia .like i would , say an outstanding park hyatt , but it is definitely a solid 4 star property .in my opinion , the pros and cons of the hotel are as follows :* staff : i always say the staff of any hotel can make or break your stay , and the staff at the hyatt house definitely made our stay pleasant .everyone from the front desk , to housekeeping , to the restaurant were friendly , helpful and professional .at one point my card - key stopped working and engineering was at my room and fixed the problem within a couple of minutes . </DOC> we stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in february , 2014 .it is conveniently located in the middle of a new upscale shopping area with plenty of restaurants and stores within walking distance .the decor was modern and comfortable .a full hot breakfast is offered with many options .plenty of free parking available close by .we came here because we have enjoyed the hyatt house in redmond , wa and will look for hyatt houses in other locations as we travel ."
45,"this hotel is a new , modern design for hyatt house .we enjoyed the location as you could walk to many restaurants , and shops .the parking was in a garage across from the hoteland it was very convenient - best of all , complimentary .the front desk agent was not professional and should not be up front .he took my husband 's credit card , but he did not put it on the reservation .we checked out and thanks to judy , she corrected the mistake .now , the one bedroom , two room suite we had was very nice , if only the keys we were given would let us in .we would leave for sightseeing , and upon returning , could not get back into our room .we were glad when we finally checked out !breakfast was lacking any fresh cut fruit .i could not believe this .hyatt places have fresh cut fruit and muffins . </DOC> nice new hotel with shopping nearby .i can walk to target and more .the studio is very small but has a kitchen .parking is in a garage across the street ...comfy bed , nice amenities , good breakfast . </DOC> stayed here on business for one night , as they were offering a great rate using priceline .very modern and and euro - looking . located in an up - scale shopping area , which i will explore on the next trip .the place is brand new , so all of the fixtures , carpets , and furnishings were clean and new .very nice folks behind the desk .this is one of the new "" green "" hotels like those in europe , so your room key in the receptacle near the doorhotel is very quiet and pleasant .wifi is free everywhere , and is fast enough to run netflix with little or no buffering .extra bathroom touches include a tube of toothpaste , big walk - in shower , up - scale soaps and shampoo .bed was very comfortable , with ample pillows . </DOC> huge bathroom , roomy and comfy lounge , and lovely bed .staff was friendly .breakfast was plentiful and better than your typical "" free buffets "" at hotels .amidst great restaurants and shops .right off the interstateso easy to get to . </DOC> the room was an efficient and comfortable studio apartment , with every amenity i could ask for .every attendee commented on the location , rooms and staff .what put this place over the top and truly puts luxury hotels to shame is the hyatt staff .i ' ve never experienced a hotel at any price point where the staff seem genuinely friendly and wanting to please .housekeeping staff , kitchen staff , engineering , sales --- they all seemed to enjoy their job , their guests and their colleagues .if all that does n't put this hotel in ' creme de la creme ' category , the mosaic district location is just superb , especially for business travelers or families who want to get out and stretch .indeed i felt the mosaic district was the extended lobby for the hotel . </DOC> this new kid on the block has done its homework and if this location is any indication of what they can do around the country , hyatt place has just upped the ante for the extended stay sector .the lobby is large comfortable and inviting .the rooms are large comfortable , well - appointed .and the rate we paid was very reasonable .the gratis breakfast was very strong , including an omelet station .the manager was clearly focused on customer service .i definitely would come back here again .this hotel was very convenient walking distance to a number of interesting business including a wonderful french bakery ( pastry xpo ) .nieman marcus last call outlet and a first class angelika film center . </DOC> this new hotel in the mosaic district , a new development in fairfax , is perfect if you have a car .the rooms and the public spaces have a nice refreshing feel .parking is easy in the ( free ) garage across the street .restaurants and entertainment are plentiful nearby .however , if you do n't have a car , it can be a problem .it 's a 10 - 15 minutes walk to the dunn loring metro station . </DOC> and i was not disappointed .the location is in the bustling mosaic complex with many interesting restaurants and shops .the front desk staff were very friendly and efficient .they were also helpful in getting me set up with a shuttle ride to my early morning meeting .the room was comfortable and roomy , but did have an odd smell .while there were no visible signs that it was dirty , it did n't smell neutral and clean .i 'll definitely go back when i need an affordable room in the dc area ."

49,"the hotel was very nice .everything was well maintained .the room was nice and well maintained .we found the staff above friendly .now that is honesty and great service !the breakfasts were very good and it was not crowded the two days we were there as it was not on a weekend .it was very good and reasonably priced .there is an underground parking garage under the hotel which is free to use .this is nice if it is raining outside .nice place to stay and close to galway area . </DOC> considering how busy they were , the service was good & quick .it was served with side salad & for what i was looking perfectly fine .hotel appeared well looked after from the outside & plenty of parking available too ! </DOC> the room was spacious with good shower and bath facilities and everything was spotlessly clean .after unpacking we returned to reception , where the staff provided details of local places of interest , also copy of timetables and local taxi numbers .we had our excursions planned in no time at all .we were able to walk to the town and the railway station from the hotel .we enjoyed a couple of cocktails in the late evenings looking out over athenry and a bit of craic with the waiters and other guests .we would definitely return to the hotel , which is in a great location for exploring the local area and galway city . </DOC> whilst a bit out of town this is a really lovely quiet spot with all mod cons .the hotel was busy with foreign tourists which is a good sign .dinner in the bar was excellent and the staff could n't have been friendlier .but i will definitely be back </DOC> after reading reviews here , i was honestly excited about the visit here but also worried that it would not reach my expectations .in the end i was disappointed with the visit .after getting a parking space the booking was handled very professionally by the receptionist ( sorry i did not remember her name but thank you )so it was a great start .the room 204 was lovely and suffice to say my wife and myself both slept well .if you are just sleeping in the room then great .the leisure area on a sunday morning was adequate .it was busythe gym room was impressive .however dinner on saturday evening was disappointing .the restaurant is very small for a 4 star hotel so we ended up staying in the bar . </DOC> this is a nice modern hotel with pleasant open areas , bar and restaurant .the staff were really good ; efficient , helpful and really good .very pleasant stay .i ate there and thought the meal was reasonable .overall it was fine and of a decent standard given the price .room furniture is a bit below luxurious , and he main negative is the windowing for 1st floor rooms .this is a pity . </DOC> staff very pleasant & helpful .food was excellent , the bar area is very well laid out & there is a large area with lots of sofas & comfortable sofas .athenry is a very interesting town with a lot of history .a visit to the castle was very enjoyable , we did go to the heritage centrebut it was closed as they were getting it ready for halloween , but a very helpful girl showed us around a few of the exhibits .i would stay in this hotel again , there is a train service into galway or to dublin which is very convenient .i have stayed in 4 star hotels that were not as nice as this one . </DOC> the bedrooms were very nice .the lobby , bar and restaurant were all nice as well .we found the reception staff exceptionally friendly , the bar staff were decent as well .the bar food was adequate , portions of main course were not enough .i had a turkey and ham on the first night that was nice , but the mash was miniscule .the breakfast was nice on both mornings .the hotel bar was very quiet and lights were out around midnight .this hotel is in a remote place outside athenry .there are no paths and twisty roads leading to the hotel , and no taxis around .if you want a quiet relaxing hotel , this is the place for you .it is not going to be a busy happening spot ."
50,"luckily , this hotel had signs on the highway and all the way to it .it turned out to be a gem .a real change from the quaint places we had been staying .the rooms were nice and clean, the location lovelyand it had a very nice restaurant .we were comfortable there and the staff was really helpful in giving us information about local sights to see . </DOC> passed by athenry many times so first time time to stay and explore this interesting town .the hotel was a bit hard to find and once again i wish all hotels etc would give out their sat nav co - ordinates in their advertisements .the hotel and staff were top drawer and made our stay most enjoyable .the walk around the historical parts of this town was also a delight plus we took some drives around the countryside and now i understand why their is a song just for this area ! """" the fields of athenry "" .the use of the leisure centre was great as was the free wi - fi . </DOC> the hotel is well situated , spotlessly clean and blessed with a receptionist who is a "" real "" people person .the room was very well appointed with a very comfortable bed anda balcony one could walk out to enjoy the fresh morning air .access to the hotel is difficult due to lack of quality signage in the town but from the tuam road access is simple and straightforward .hopefully i will have reason to visit once again . </DOC> the hotel looks better from the outside and slightly disappoints in the inside with the rooms bland and nothing special .however the pool area is great with all facilities you would need .the bar was quiet in my visit , food was excellent but staff not very chatty considering there was not much for them to be working at .breakfast was excellent and fresh cooked .the hotel is a good place as a stop overbut not exactly somewhere i 'd visit for a weekend as its so close to galway . </DOC> the hotel lies in the middle of no - where , but it medium sized and modern .the indoor heated pool is perfect for a few laps , followed by some time in the spa .the breakfast is very good , with excellent tasting and fresh croissantsthe staff is not only very friendly , but will help you with any of your issues or problems .overall , if you 're visiting ireland , this is the place to stop over . </DOC> it was very easy to find from the motorway , the staff in reception were very friendly , parking was free , wifi was free and a good speed andthe bar and restaurant areas were very comfortable .sleep quality was good too ., it 's got everything you need . </DOC> decor is fresh and modern and the hotel was spotless throughout .the underground car park was a huge bonus as when we arrived it was blowing a gale and lashing rain - it was lovely not to get drenched !the large function room is at the far end of hotel from reception area , so fairly self contained with its own bar , bathrooms and seating areas .breakfast was ideal , nicely laid out and ample choice .some natural yoghurt pots would be a nice add to the selection available .overall we had a pleasant stay .only suggestion would be to add some extra floor staff for large functions to keep on top of clearing tables of glasses / cups .we would consider a further stay at raheen woods hotel and given its proximity to galway city we would recommend it as an alternative to city hotels , particularly for anyone looking to explore oranmore/ kinvara/ the burren area . </DOC> the rooms are very comfortable and clean and the staff very friendly .the food is acceptable but unfortunately not really exciting , but overall good value for money ."
51,"stayed for just one night and this brand new hotel has served us well .it is close to a big shopping mall , and it 's just 15 minutes drive to gibraltar .the room was quite big and comfortable .beds were very comfortable - again , it 's a brand new hotel ! can recommend to families with small kids . </DOC> stayed here for one night whilst visiting family living in the area .the hotel is in the middle of an industrial estate , so not the prettiest location , however , as long as you 're aware of that it should n't cause you any problems .just off the main road , easy to find . near the cinecity complex .hotel itself was very clean and modern .bedrooms were roomy and comfortable .staff very friendly .good choice for breakfast , rolls , cereal , etc . have no complaints about this hotel and would definately stay here in the future .good price also ! </DOC> we stayed here for 2 nights as a departure point for visits to gibraltar and tangier .quite satisfied overall .not especially spacious , but clean , efficient , and well appointed .staff was friendly and helpful .breakfast was decent .wifi was good .beds were comfortable .location was a bit out of the way but fine for our purposes .we did find one gecko in our room , which was a bit disconcerting .i gather this is not unusual there . </DOC> it 's nice and new , but located away from the main attractions in the area , e.g. gibraltar .a 20 euro taxi will get you to most attractions from the hotel .the hotel is new , quite , fresh and clean , the staff are very helpful and it helped us that they spoke english .the breakfast in express inns are basic continental but considering the room rate this hotel is a great option . . </DOC> this is a very brand new hotel in algeciras spain , very clean , very good buffet restaurant and very nice staff .the room was very clean , white and clean blankets , good and supportive matress .room an bathroom smell fresh and clean . </DOC> always like staying at this hotel , which is approx 15 - 20 mins from gibraltar .staff are always happy to see you and checking inis quick and professional .represents value for money , will stay here again , probably next month . </DOC> the location itself is somewhat uninspiring but as a piece to stayit 's fine .the room had large a state of the art flatscreen tv with loads of channels & connection possibilities for devices .there were ample sockets beside the bed .from the other side there is a view of the runway .as usual breakfast is included but again as usual equally uninspiring ! decent bacon sausage & eggsbut if you are more include to a continental breakfast you 'll be disappointed .only limited parking outbackso my advice is when you get your parking confirmation from reception & have your spot , leave your car there .another guest made the mistake of moving & was complaining like mad when there was not spot left .you can walk to town within 15 minutes or in the other direction to the eastern beach .you often see cleaning staff at work in the restaurant and all communal parts . </DOC> rooms are clean , tidy , modern and quiet .beds and pillows were comfortable .good quality wifi .breakfast was ok – typical cold buffet .plenty of free parking in the hotel grounds and the vicinity .staff were pleasant and helpful .location is about 20 minutes from the gibraltarian border .it ’s in a business park with loads of shopping – big brands , outlets , supermarkets etc .contrary to many other reports , we were able to take our car in and out of gibraltar with no delays at all .there is free parking at the bottom cable car station and at various other points .the walk from the cable car to the town centre is about 5 - 10 minutes .diesel was only 57p per litre in gibraltar ."
52,"as people have said its a good location to stay in for a visit to gib .a small mall across the road with a selection of eats . plus a nh hotel with a better bar to get a drink in .but it is included .car parking is ok , either in the cramped area around the hotel or on the street .two nights was ok .not a real holiday hotel .the drive to the frontier was easy 10mins , and parking on the spanish side was € 15 for the day .petrol cheap on the gib side .electronics in gib are not cheap at more than high street prices in the uk . </DOC> so , we quickly had to find a hotel near gibraltar for a reasonable price .we were quite surprised by the quality and value of this hotel - located just minutes from the spain - gibraltar border .driving up , you get a bit worried since the road is n't the bestand it is in a very industrial area .and we just wanted to get a snack and a few shots of caballero ( a liqueur native to the andalucia area of spain - where this hotel is located ) .when we arrived inside , the staff was very welcoming and the hotel lobby was clean butthe staff was extremely helpful and pleasant and we met a family from the united states also staying there - who we saw a few days later in seville ( what 's the chances of that ? ! ) . </DOC> we had stayed the night before at a downtown hotel of one of the major spanish companies in another city .in this case , the property is pristine and looks brand new . ample parking up front .second , friendly service behind the check in counter .all of the staff we encountered were lovely .beds are quite comfortable .the air conditioner and ice available in hallways was just stupendous .however , the air conditioner in this hotel was so goodtv were superb .nice bar in the lobby .nice convenient location about 15 minute drive to gibraltar .can not wait to return and do that day trip .last but not least , it was very affordable . </DOC> this hotel is great for one night stopover close to the highway .it is new and delicate .the location is in the middel of nowhere and the suroundings not very interestingbut it includes a large cinema center .breakfast is basic but good . free parking on the premises . </DOC> so no complaint there .it is ideal for staying in en route to tarifa or gibraltar for sure .we used it as stop over before the ferry to tangier .this hotel is really modern and clean and our room was excellent .front desk staff were friendly and helpful .breakfast was good too .no mention of this on arrivalso we had planned to eat there .the only walkable option was the local cinema complex where we did find a chain food outlet hich was hot food but not the hotel experince expected .this is really not acceptable for a chain such as hi .so was doubly annoyed as it takes many stays to get a free stay .. to their credit </DOC> we chose this hotel since we needed easy access to the highways and had a car .the location was ideal and ease in visiting gibraltar , tarifa , and tangier , morocco which was our focus .it was a bit tricky on locating the hotel the first time due to the newness of it .the breakfast staff seemed overwhelmed in terms of handling group tours but we managed .we could n't have been more pleased on how ideal it was to access all travel sites from here . </DOC> cute modern rooms .very helpful and friendly staff .they gave me advice on local things to visit .there 's a couple things around there to walk to .easy to find because of these sculptural towers close by .i stayed here before going to the port to morocco . </DOC> stayed here before my flight home from gibraltar .this is a new hotel and the rooms felt fresh and modern .the service and breakfast were very good .it provided all i wanted for a good nights sleep before an early flight from gibraltar and is a short drive to the airport"
53,"very comfortable room with good beds , good ac & a large shower in the bathroom which i loved !good breakfast set us up for the day , good job as i hadn`t realised we woul;d have to queue for two hours to get onto gib ! would definitely use again , oh& i nearly forgot to mention the reception staff who really went out of their way to be helpful , such a refreshing change in spain, however the cleaners need a bit of a rocket as daily clean not up to scratch ! </DOC> travelling down to gibralter we picked this hotel for convenience and the fact that it was a good price ahead of new year .the room was basic but clean .the breakfast was well stocked for the price paid so overall , very good value . </DOC> this was our stop between gibraltar and our flight out of rota the next day .we did n't expect much but were pleasantly pleased with our experience .the staff was friendly and helpful .our room was clean and well appointed .we 'd definitely stay here again .it 's a pretty feature , but would be better if there was some way to cover the window to keep light out of the room . </DOC> we stayed at this hotel because we were planning to visit gibraltar and also to take the ferry trip from tarifa to tangier .los barrios is central to those locations - about 15 - 20 minutes by car to gibraltar and 30 - 40 minutes to tarifa .the hotel itself is fine - well maintained , clean , and with everything you would expect .the staff were pleasant and helpful .there is not really much near this area - a couple of big box stores , a carrefour , mcdonald 's , and a lot of open space .since we used the hotel only as a base for other things , it was fine .if you want to be in a more bustling location with easy access to restaurants / shopping / culture , you may want to opt for algeciras or even tarifa . </DOC> hie 's are more or less standard whichever one you choose .this one is ideal for those travelling south to the algeciras ferries or to portugal , southern spain .we stayed overnight whilst visting friends in palmones , a great little place about 5 minutes away with lots of bars and restaurants .the hotel itself is a bit isolated and lies within a commercial zone comprising shops and offices , but has easy access for algeciras .the room was ' spick and span ' , in fact excellent .the lobby area was a good size ,the complimentary breakfast fine and the staff were friendly and helpful .all told a nice hotel at a good price . </DOC> very modern and clean hotel .located in an industrial zone , but a pretty modern and safe one .service was very good and all members of staff were english speaking .rooms are large and bright , and super clean .breakfast is more than adequate .will stay here again ! </DOC> it was very tastefully designed and particularly like the bathroom .the breakfast in the morning was quite good as well .very disappointing to an otherwise good stay . </DOC> easy to find in kind of an industrial type area .easy on and off from the freeway . free parking but somewhat limited .the front desk staff were excellent .it is a much better breakfast than any holiday inn express in the states .the room was well appointed .it was a typical holiday inn express room similar to the states in this aspect .bathroom , while a tad small was functional and clean .we were actually staying someplace closeso we could go to gibraltar the next couple of days and this place worked out very well .get on the freeway , drive a few miles , take an exit , park , walk along the mediterranean and enter gibraltar .the hotel worked very well for us ."
54,"this hotel is in a great location -- walking distance to the imperial palace , across the street from many great rstaurants and the akasaka - mitsuke metro station .this station services many lines so you can be in all tourist areas within 10min .the wifi works great , staff is extremely helpful .bus to narita and haneda airport stops right in front of the hotel and you can purchase tickets from concierge . </DOC> this is a modern business hotel , with basic amenities -slippers , toothbrushes , shavers etc well stocked .another great plus is the airport limo that stops right at the door step .situated within chiyoda - ku you can walk or take the subway to ginza , roppongi , shinjuku . </DOC> we came back again and had a very different experience .what had previously been an altogether pleasant experience dropped back to average .our room was small , crowded and uncomfortable .it made for a very long week with two of us in the room .this time around , the service was not up to the previous standard either .not a terrible experience , but a bit disappointing overall . </DOC> location of this hotel is excellent , central and extremely well connected .3 metro lines are a cross the street , and another 2 a little walk away .its relative proximity to the imperial palace makes it a good option to walk along its moat to the kokusai forum and ginza area my room was a moderate single .i knew beforehand that rooms either face the modern tokyo akasaka modern cityscape or a kind of garden on the backside .it was facing this backside , with it 's extremely high trees .i was little disappointed in the beginning as the room looked dull , but this proved to be a big asset , and it was kind of a nice retreat in the hustle and bustle of tokyo , with genuine bird singing every morning !fridge and expresso machine come very handy for any stay longer than a couple of days . </DOC> this hotel is well located for the metro and is on the airport bus route .there are lots of places to eat round the hotel .but the room was dated and poorly designed .the large bed was too big for the space available resulting in poor access each side , particularly the side with the room light switches and telephone .there was very limited storage space for clothes .the room was hot and stuffy with no opening window and an air conditioning unit which could heat but not cool .the bathroom was good but had a shower , no bath .breakfast was good . </DOC> the room is very new and pleasant , with playful touches , and of course super clean .the hotel is located across the station and the airport shuttle bus departs from the front entrance , so it is extremely convenient .however , reception is on the 3rd floor and there is a upscale shopping centre and restaurants on the ground floor , 1st and 2nd floor , plus underground parking .the lifts do not require swipe cards to operate and is essentially open to the public , so security is a bit lax .though japan is very safe and the area is a business district , so we wo n't concerned . </DOC> i chose this hotel because it is near to city center .the room is pretty tidy when we arrived , though it looks pretty old , but good enough for our stay .the staff are very friendly , the concierge has even spend sometime with me to troubleshoot my transport back to airport by looking at the various options .the hotel has nearby train station and also lots of good foods , restaurant and bars .it is just 4 stops away to ginza , about 10 stops away to asakusa , and so on .i will definitely consider it again when i am in tokyo city . </DOC> we spent the first two nights of our trip here sleeping , eating , and making mini excursions on the tokyo subway trying to adjust to the time change .there is a subway station across the street .the reception staff include excellent language speakers , equipped with maps and local expertise , and the hotel is served by a limousine / bus from narita airport .mcdonalds is across the street and espresso is a ail able for free in the room .ed 's and was quiet despite being above the street ."

58,"i have been a semi - regular guest at the tokyu for several years and it is a solid hotel .close to everything you need , with a great staff and nice rooms .when in japan , i like a smaller room , or should i say , an appropriate - sized room( i found the palatial rooms of the grand prince a sickening waste of space ) .tokyu rooms are what you need and no more .the value is decent , though tokyo could probably demolish 20 % of its hotels and turn the land back into parks . </DOC> this hotel is in an excellent location just across the road from the subway station which can get you almost anywhere in tokyo .the rooms are relatively quiet even though there 's a busy road out front .staff are very polite and helpful at all times .an excellent breakfast is served on the third floor .english is spoken quite well by most staff who can help you with directions to get to where you want to go .a very good choice . </DOC> ✅ location works opposite the subway station ✅ hotel checkinis fast ✅ no pool ✅ no gym ✅feels like a hospital ✅ rooms are extremely small ✅ old and dated rooms✅ wifi ispatchy ✅ bathroom is extremely small ✅ smelled a little ✅ expensive hotel for the quality of hotel ✅room rate is probably based on location would not stay again not worth it </DOC> i booked a set of rooms at the akasaka excel , a hotel i like and have stayed at several times before , and would stay again .it is a good hotel , good location near the metro .as the hotel was full , it was basically a take it or leave it situation - not very good .otherwise , a good stay , and helpful staff .special mention goes to the organisation for medical assistance ( my wife needed to consult a doctor ) with clear instructions for accessing a nearby clinic with english speaking staff .having traveled often enough to need this service from hotels several times before , this was the best we have encountered . </DOC> many people think of shinjuku or shibuya as good tokyo hotel destinations , but we have stayed in the akasaka area several times ( including at the prince which is now a huge building site ) .the hotel is most easily accessed from the akasaka - mitsuke station as it is directly across the road ( on both the ginza and maranouchi subway lines ) , but the nagatacho station is also very close .this makes it a good location for exploring the city , but does require a transfer when travelling to / from tokyo .the rooms ( we had booked superior doubles ) were comfortable and enough space to relax for the several days we were in tokyo .other nice things were the 7 - 11 and the tullys coffee shop on the ground floor - made breakfast and getting snacks very easy . </DOC> the akasaka excel hotel tokyu is a good central location , immediately opposite akasaka - mitsuke metro station .my room was a reasonable size for tokyo with everything you need – nice comfy bed , average - sized bathroom , desk space to work .very good breakfast with lots of choice .nice , always attentive staff .as an aside , try out the yona yona beer kitchen akasaka 30 seconds away in the same block for great food and great beer ; you might want to book as it gets very busy . </DOC> the hotel is conveniently placed next to the nagatacho underground station , which has links to other underground lines .rooms are small but clean and have everything you need such as fridge , safe and free wifi .reception is on the third floor and this floor also has an elevator which goes down to the second floor and onto an overhead walkway - which is the easiest way to get across the busy street . </DOC> a perfect hotel for business and leisure travelers , just opposite to several malls and dining options .this hotel is very well situated the subway and metro rails ie akasaka mitsuke station .the breakfast is fantastic and the top floor restaurant and bar by nadaman is ecstatic ."

63,"our room on the very top floor as expected is small ... even had trouble finding a space for our large suit case .the layout is kind of weird with a sofa and table separating 2 huge comfortable beds .one the plus side , the shower / tub area is spacious and its really clean .the room is a smoking room and surprisingly it was not smelly at all .location is good , 5 -10 minutes walk up the pedestrian bridge to shibuya station and shopping malls .it was tough on the day of arrival dragging our huge suitcase from the station to the hotel though .....but other than that it was definately a convenient location .breakfast was ok and the staffs are friendly and helpful .overall it was a good experience . </DOC> initial room was fine , but upgrade was stunning in an annex suite with a downstairs lounge and bedroom up .huge big bathroom along with excellent amenities ( an upgrade from the basics in our original room )the bed was greatand we had big sliding window shades that opened up to a city view .breakfast was included but nothing specialso we ate elsewhere for the remaining days .perfect location ( 100 m from shibuya station ) and we were worried we might get lost as per other reviewsbut it was n't a problem at all if you use the hotel instructions on the website ! </DOC> tokyo hotels can be a challenge , especially at the last minute , and especially more if it 's a weekend .i found the granbell hotel in shibuya .it 's located about 150 m from shibuya station , clean to a fault , and not too difficult to find .the staffs are great and can speak english , japanese , and even some korean and chinese it seems .-breakfast was good with two options to choose from : western ( served in the 1st floor bar ) and japanese ( on the 2nd floor ) .-wifi is good , although a little weak in the lobbies .price for the location , quality of the room , and the fact that this is tokyo .great hotel and definitely would love to come back , albeit in a larger room , although i have no complaints about the size because it is to be expected in japan . </DOC> needed to stay here for one night when we first arrived as our apartment was not ready for the first night .the hotel was fine , location is good .i found the room very small – although i had n’t booked the one of the bigger rooms .there is a nice little area outside to sit and watch the world go by .breakfast was basic but ok . </DOC> yes , the rooms are small .tiny , it 's tokyo .once you settle in you 'll realize this is all you need perfectly located in the heart of shibuya .very clean and comfortable bed , fantastic housekeeping staff , terrific toiletries , very good breakfast , excellent coffee .spent a week here in april at a very reasonable rate .it was very hard to find from shibuya station ( the first time ) but once you figure it out there are landmarks everywhere to easily lead you back to the hotelwish i could give some advice to make it easier the first time around .i spent over an hour wandering around lost with my luggage .maybe it 's just me . </DOC> had almost no trouble finding the hotel .it 's about a 3 minute walk from the cerulean tower ( where the airport limo bus drops you and picks you up , if you 're going that route ) .i had few expectations for the hotel , but was pleasant surprised by the lobby and check - in areas .the funky elevator lighting and hallway lighting are typical of a mid - range boutique style hotel , and i was very happy with the spotless ( albeit compact ) room .my previous stays in tokyo have been at the intercon and hilton , with full - size western style rooms , so this was a bit of fun .we cleaned up and hit the town .they asked us to pack up our stuff in case they could n't rectify the water situation . </DOC> we got a deluxe room , with a larger bed .the bed was very comfortable .the room was extremely clean .the staff was very nice .the pizza place adjoined to the hotel was nice .there are several restaurants close by that are also good .it was extremely easy to walk to the shibuya station .we followed the directions on the hotel website , and we able to find the hotel easily .we liked the location .we would stay there again . </DOC> first , the good : the location is amazing .shibuya is a great neighborhood and it is very close to the center of it all .the service was amazing from the very beginning .we were greeted warmly and the staff was amazing about the reason of our stay , our honeymoon !the staff was so good to us that this was not a major issue .all in all , it was a good stay .it will probably look pretty cool once the renovations are finished ."
64,"my two nights at shibuya granbell were plenty comfortable : nice bed , super shower , deluxe toiletries , fun decor , small frig , speedy elevators .the hotel was clean .the staff was polite .cooked breakfast served in 2f restaurant was good ; but the breakfast buffet in 1f cona cafe was mediocre ( cold eggs and sausage ) .breakfast and taxes ) , i would recommend the granbell to others seeking a convenient base in shibuya . </DOC> stayed for 3 nights in july .excellent located in the quiet part of shibuya and very near the station . arrived in late evening and missed the front door and entered through the side door . stayed in a standard single roomand it was really small and unable to open my luggage properly .bathroom was also pretty small but functional , window could be opened in the room .breakfast was complimentary and only adequate .the safe was placed on top of the fridge and items got rather warm inside .hissing noise came through underneath the door during my stay . </DOC> not a pleasant stay .the staff was accommodating at check - in / out , but all the balance was substandard .parking was a headache .rooms are small ( even for japan ) .close to station but in a dark area .even for one night , there are better options around . </DOC> in a quiet street close to shibuya train station , granbell hotel is perfect to explore tokyo .the hotel is walking distance to a lot of shops in shibuya , harajuku and a bit further ahead omotesando .by train or underground the all city is at hand .the rooms have nice design and are functional .sleeping quality is very good . </DOC> we had a very comfortable 3 nights at the granbell .the location is great , once you find your way out of the maze that is shibuya station ( metro exit 16 if you do n't mind stairs ) .there are loads and loads of bars and restaurants nearby .we slept very well in the bed .the room was a little tired and the carpet was stained by a past guest .breakfast was great and we enjoyed both the japanese and western breakfasts . </DOC> within a short walk of shibuya station and shibuya crossing , the location is excellent .the rooms are very small , but with so much on offer in tokyo i barely spent any time in my room .staff were friendly and helpful .the room was comfortable and clean , but i felt it was starting to get a bit tired .the bathroom amenities were excellent and plentiful .i enjoyed my stay in shibuya and the hotel was more than adequate and good value for the location . </DOC> first of all ; the location is great .2 minutes from jr shibuya , which connects you with almost everywhere in tokyo .bathroom was nice , the bed was great ... nice sheets and everything .the tv though was n't very good .i tried to figure out the ac , without success .spoke to the reception which told me , that it can only heat in march / april .the reception though was very good at pointing out directions though .the ( included ) breakfast was not good at all .not worth it .overall a good hotel at the perfect location , but they could do sooooo much better . </DOC> i meanwhile find it to be merely good to average .it certainly is nice and modern and the location is excellent .it should however be mentioned that service is rather cold and distant and that the two rooms i stayed in both only had one power outlet and very basic television programs .while i do n't regret my stay here it wo n't be a place i will be raving about in the future ."
65,"nice hotel , nice room .room are not so big , as usual in japan .laundry service is ok .breakfast nothnig special service is ok .the building itself is not so high so all the room do not have a nice view . </DOC> great location from haneda airport ( easy to find 10 minute walk from the cerulean tower hotel by airport limousine ) .also quick walk to shibuya subway station , to shibuya crossing and nearby lots of restaurants .tons of shopping also within a short distance of the hotel .we walked to harajuku area and that was less than a 30 minute walk away .again more shopping and restaurants .great breakfast every morning .full bath and amazing shower .comfy bed and duvet .great sleep and also for tossing and turning due to jetlag ! happy with our choice as hotels can be quite pricey in tokyo . </DOC> the shibuya granbell is tucked away in a side street a mere 5 minutes walk from the shibuya crossing -so it ’s fairly quiet at night but still very close to all the action .and it had a separate shower , basin and toilet , all well spaced out and with lots of shelvingthe room itself had ample space for my suitcase , and writing desk and a comfortable single bed pushed against the wall .i ’d defientely stay here again . </DOC> this is the thrid time i ' ve stayed at this hotel , which should tell you everything you need to know .you ca n't beat it for location : close to shibuya station which will get you anywhere in tokyo fast and easy to reach from either airport .staff is helpful and friendly and the place is neat and tidy with a quiet room . </DOC> normally we stay in one of the larger hotels in downtown shibuya , but this time we wanted a change .we were after something more intimate , a hotel with character , but still with a convenient location .our room was quite spacious for tokyo standards .spread over two levels with an amazing bathroom .free wifi , complimentary breakfast , and a late check out .just a short walk from the cerulean hotel ( and a drop off point for the limousine bus from both airports ) , this hotel is a great option in tokyo .remember to book in advance to receive the best rates .apparently the small rooms are quite small , but the service and location of hotel will make up for the small floor space . </DOC> however many other aspects were in line with a stylish boutique hotel starting with the excellent desk service .the room we had was ok sized with good bed great shower , fluffy towels , slippers , bathrobes etcthere was an empty minibar , a very handy free mobile phone with internet connection to take out of the room - free of charge -this café had the most amazing thin crust pizzas - almost as good as our ones back home in rome ! plus a god atmosphere and some outside seating .all in all we enjoyed our stay despite the rain and shibuya- probably would stay in another neighbourhood next time .the granbell however is not noisy but on a side street away from the crowds . </DOC> shibuya is a fantastic place to stay in tokyo - very central to every place you are likely to want to visit .this hotel - although quite small - is very convenient to shibuya station ( a short 5 minute walk )- even the narita express goes from this station - and a bit further walk from the central shopping district .the bathrooms were the best we had had in japan .the staff on the desk were very helpful , even when we had to arrive in tokyooverall - i would be very happy to stay at this hotel again on my next trip to tokyo . </DOC> we stayed here for three nights at the start of our japanese holiday .the location is ideal - so many eateries , shopping options ; nightlife and bars within seconds but just slightly removed from the hectic shibuya crossing .the airport limousine from narita drops you off nearby andof course shibuya station can get you almost anywhere .the rooms are compact - i ’d have liked a little more space , but that ’s expected in japan .breakfast decent and service very helpful .i ’d happily stay here again if i was coming back to tokyo ."
66,"the first thing to say about this hotel is that it is n’t very easy to find , especially for first time visitors to japan ( like us ) .it is recommended you print out a map before leaving and even taxi drivers are not sure where it is ( although four sets of locals who met us there all found it with no problem ) .if you are coming from shibuya station head for the west exit then use the walkway to cross the road .it does have a separate toilet and one of the best showers we have ever experienced .as it turned out we preferred this room , even though it is slightly smaller . </DOC> this hotel is very well located in a small street near shibuya square .hence it is very calm .however , before arriving , make sure you have a good room .mine had a really small window , and the view was ... a wall ...ok , you do n't stay in tokyo to stay all day long in your bedroom butstill , it would be nice to warn people .and when i tried to change my room , they said it was impossible ...the room was clean , but still had some doubts about the carpet ... </DOC> the room i booked here was tiny , but as i soon found out : everything is in japan ! and as as tiny as it was , it had everything you need for a short stay in tokyo : a comfortable bed , great shower , very clean and even though it is virtually in the heart of tokyoit was very quiet at night . for a short sightseeing trip , when you are hardly in your room , it is perfect and very close to transport to the rest of the city and the airport .and it looks cool to boot . </DOC> if you want a decent hotel in a central location near shibuya this is your hotel .i will stay here again if i would come back again to tokyo .pros - location is superb , 5 minutes from shibuya pedestrian crossing - hotel has free coffee and water in reception - roomis very small - hotel offer from free a smartphone with internet connection andfree local calls to use during your stay - staff is very kind and polite cons - breakfast is terrible . </DOC> this is a great little hotel in a very convenient location a short walk from shibuya station .the hotel is located in the quieter part of shibuya up a bit of a hillbut nothing too bad and surrounded by some nice small restaurants .room 611 was bright and smallbut i was expecting that , everything was nice and fresh as you would expect with it being brand new .despite the room being tiny it was really nice and had everything i needed for a two night stay ,comfortable double bed but due to the size of the roomgreat glass enclosed shower room with a fantastic shower with both a rainhead shower and handheld shower and a very high tech automated washlet which to my surprise had the seat pre - heated . </DOC> location in the middle of shibuya a hundred meters away from train station is hard to beat .the rooms in the annex are generally nicer and newer than the ones in the older part of the hotel .avoid the long , narrow and dark ' premier double ' rooms .the ' modern double ' rooms are far better .the lobby of the hotel is cluttered with bags and posters and is showing significant wear and tear .some of the staff is quite unfriendly - particularly odd in japan .breakfast is fine . </DOC> so , tokyo 's pretty cool , but it 's kind of difficult to find anything other than the major hotels in town - previous trips have ended up at the ginza tobu or dai - ichi hotels (and what a result .fabulously located ( 2 minutes walk from shibuya station ) on a quiet enough , but not dead , backstreet and super , super cool .and they 're more than big enough , and very , very stylish and comfortable .the bar / restaurant at the front of the hotel pop.pie serves great casual food ( i had an incredibly painstakingly made chilli - dog that was nothing short of excellent ) and good drinks and , extremely rarely for japan , is open 24 hours .so it 's ultra - stylish </DOC> excellent location in a quiet area of shibuya .breakfast is excellent with set meals to choose from .modern ambiance make the hotel rooms more spacious . will stay here again in the future"

70,"select mitsui garden ueno as it is conveniently located just a few minutes walk from keisei skyliner station from narita & located across from jr ueno station & tokyo metro just next to the hotel making the hotel very convenient to explore tokyo .the area surrounding the hotel also has a lot of affordable food and shopping options .service is good and efficient , staffs are trying to do their best despite lack of english proficiency .will definitely stay there again if visiting tokyo . </DOC> because it was good we decide to came back .the hotel is very conveniently located at ueno train station .the narita airport expresstrain is less than 10 minutes away .the rooms are small as for most japanese business hotels .the rooms and bathrooms are modern and clean .this came in really handy as i had tons of clothes to wash .nothing bad about this hotel which is worth mentioning . </DOC> and i actually like the location even though it is not in tokyo per se .it is a five to eight minute walk from ueno station ( use the asakusa exit and use the overhead pathways in the direction of the skytree ) , is close to ameyoko ( which is definitely worth a visit ) , and within a short walk of ueno par and ueno zoo ( and the new pandas ) .having only opened last year , the rooms are spacious ( for a japanese hotel ) , modern with good bathrooms .the metro is right next to the hotel so accessibility around tokyo is not really an issue .staff were generall helpful .would happily stay here again . </DOC> spent couple nights at the hotel during my visit to tokyo , the location is great , metro station is just next door , also just cross the pedestrians bridge and you get to jr and skyliner to narita .the staff was very friendly and the room even small as per japan standard had everything you need and was comfortable .couple tips go to hard rock at ueno jr station for breakfast very good with good price , in the 2nd floor of jr station there is a money exchange place and just crossing the street a sunplus convience store . </DOC> mitsui garden hotel ueno has small but clean and comfortable rooms , the beds are very comfortable and there is a large window so you can have a nice view of the city outside .as usual in japan , service is excellent and staff can not be more helpful .the hotel is in a good area with small shops , restaurants and many coffee shop for breakfast , if you do n’t want breakfast in the hotel .location is really excellent , few minutes walking from ueno station , tokyo metro and the keisei skyliner station . </DOC> this hotel is well situated near ueno jr and metro stations and also close to the skyliner train from narita .it 's a comfortable and well maintained hotel with most features one expects nowadays , including internet availability in the room .reception staff were pleasant and helpful when asked and met all our needs .the rooms we were offered were on the small side , with limited shelf space for clothes and toiletries , but overall just adequate .our only other experience of a modern tokyo hotel was the hotel century southern tower in lively shinjuku which was quite spacious by comparison to this hotel , cheaper , and only one subway station from the skyliner line from narita . </DOC> for transportation , the hotel is near everything we need – the ueno station for hibiya and ginza lines is right next to the hotel( and we used that every day ) , the station for the jr yamanote line is also just across the street .the keisei train to and from the airport is not far ,about 5 - 7 minutes walk .we discovered the elevators ( one near the hotel , and the other on the other end near the jr station ) at the pedestrian bridge ; so , it was much easier to walk to take the train back to the airport with our luggage .the area around the hotel is vibrant .the famous ameyoko market is only about 5 minutes away on foot .the room is very clean and functional .the beds are comfortable . </DOC> we recently stayed at mitsui garden ueno for six nights and were delighted with our choice .the room wasspotlessly clean and bed linen was changed every day .the bathroom was a good size and had some nice extras e.g. toothbrushes , razor , mouthwash etc .check in and out was very easy and the staff had enough english to explain all the basics .the location of the hotel was great for usand we could walk to quite a few of the attractions and sites we wanted to visit .for all others , ueno stations were perfectly located .we were also very well located for the train to narita airport .ueno park was a lovely facility to have so close to us and a wander around the park and browsing the many food stalls is a must .overall , this is a lovely quiet hotel and i would stay again in the morning:- )"
71,"we stayed here 7 nights on business and could not fault , yes the rooms are smaller than aust but were efficient and modern and clean .ueno was a great location , easy to get to from the airport , easy hub to explore tokyo , plenty of shopping and food close by .the staff were so helpful they came across the road to the mini mart to operate the ticketing machine so we could buy some football tickets , then their help with what trains to catch was also spot on .we booked directly with the hotel after becoming members and got the best rate </DOC> you pay accordingly to the surface , of course . to us , the basic 18m2 is ok, the only thing is that there so many amenities , surely very important to the japanese , but to us , westerners , we do n't even understand for what purpose they are there .we like : - ueno area , so convenient coming or going to naritaquiet from inside , and outside .- wifi , hot corner ....we do n't :- nothing so far as long as we arrive from nrt, we 'll stay in this area , now that the skyliner is less than 45 minutes back to narita .and the hotel is very neat </DOC> stayed there for a week - small hotel opposite the ueno station complex - can be directly reached through the skywalks from the main station - excellent location - easily accessible from narita through the ueno skyliner .excellent service in the hotel .breakfast was a little poor - lack of choices - very small restaurant - but dinner in the same restaurant - it transforms to an italian one - was good . will like to stay there again . </DOC> the hotel is located right next to the ueno train station .if you navigate the station correctly ( not an easy task ) you come out right next door to the hotel entrance .staff are welcoming but speak little / no english .room is clean and modern but small .comfortable beds and pillows .breakfast room is small with very attentive staff with a mixture of japanese and western cuisine .we stayed two nights and the buffet selection was different each day which was a nice touch .when staying in ueno ( go to the museum of science and natural history ! ! )then i would recommend this hotel </DOC> simple and clean , small room but very practical - perfect location for meeting people at the ueno station - taking the kesei skylineris a breeze from narita - even easy after a 10 hour flight . will be back . </DOC> we stayed here for just the one night as we had a flight very early the next morning .the vicinity to the station was most important to catch the train to the airport .the rooms were fine and the bathroom was nice .the beds were comfortable and it is also in close to a shopping mall were we bought some dinner to bring back to the room .fine for the price . </DOC> the hotel is located just in front of ueno station where you can very easily access both to tokyo metro and raliway network .in addition it is 5 minutes walking from skylineexpress train from narita to tokyo .in 40 minutes you reach this hotel from narita airport .the check in was fast and easy and the personnel very polite .the room was clean butquite expensive the laundry service .the restaurant in the hotel is italian one , with a good breakfast but at 8.00 am overcrowded , almost impossible to get a table .the overall ratio price quality for a central hotel in tokyo is excellent .if i will use this hotel again next time in tokyo </DOC> the room was slightly bigger than the usual japanese hotels .it is near ueno subway and eateries .also , near shopping area like as kappabashi street which sells fake japanese food , coffee , homewares and wholesale goods .staff displayed the usual japanese courtesy ."
72,"i chose the mitsui garden hotel ueno while in tokyo for business , and was very happy with it .the transport access is quite convenient .the skyliner from narita goes right to ueno , and then ( once you figure out the pedestrian tunnels ) , you can walk underground almost to the hotel 's door .it is easy to get around the city on the trains and subways from ueno .the hotel itself is quite new , so clean , and modern .management has gone to the trouble to train the staff well ; they are welcoming and friendly and efficient .i will stay here again . </DOC> while the hotel is very close to the keisei airport line which makes it convenient to commute between the hotel and narita , it still is a 10 min walk through quite few road crossings and hence with luggage can be a bit tiring .the rooms ( presume it is the same with most hotels in japan ) is very small .while one could manage as one had one large suitcase , for a couple or family for the price the rooms are tiny with absolutely no storage space .the multi point phone connector was a very useful thing .while there are a lot of electrical gadgets the instructions are all in japanese and hence of little use .the staff are friendly , no complaints on that front . would prefer to chose more centrally located hotels on the next trip , while with the ueno metro getting around is not tough </DOC> we stayed here early july .i chose this location because of the proximity to several of the train lines ( jr yamamote sen , subway , shinkansen and train to narita airport ) .it is indeed across from ueno train station ( jr ) and next door to exits 1 and 2 of the gina subway line .it is about 2 blocks to the keisei line that goes to narita .the hotel itself is modern , clean , and the rooms fairly spacious for tokyo ( more like the size of a city boutique hotel in the us ) .temperature control was easy to adjust , and there was a useful english translation provided .we had an upper floor which provided a nice view of the ueno area .the room was quiet .service was excellent ! </DOC> this hotel is located in front of ueno station .it is near the ueno parkbut you have to cross the station to reach the park .this hotel is conveniently located .around the area are some resraurants and food stalls .also in this area , around 2 - 3 minutes walk , you will reach ameya yokocho which is an open market .the hotel in general is ok .the lobby is not very big but very clean .the breakfast food though is excellent .the rooms are spacious and well kept .i had a great stay in this hotel and will definitely come back . </DOC> overnight in tokyo : ueno is convenient for transport between plane and train , an interesting neighborhood in its own right , and close to the draws of asakusa .the hotel is clean , comfortable , and an easy stone 's throw from ueno station .for tokyo , decent value for money ( $ 125/night for single ) ... comparable to a typical marriott courtyard .i wo n't hesitate to return . </DOC> i chose this hotel because of the convenient location for skyliner train from narita .room was small but clean .i particularly like the humidifier in the room as the air could get pretty dry with the heating .very friendly front desk . </DOC> what 's good : it 's right next to ueno jr station .in less than 10 minutes , with a straightforward walk through some easily navigated subways you can be on the new keisei skyliner express train that take as little as 40 minutes to narita .the room was small but well equipped and comfortable and you can hardly hear outside .what 's not : that convenience is very expensive .the breakfast is atrocious .it starts at 7 , and a line forms for that early , then it 's a narrow line past a poor collection of budget - hotel style offerings and a bit of pasta .the tables are so close that you can hardly get in .they smilingly directed me to a print shop over the road ! ! !my wife asked for help with the bags .they wanted to charge her . </DOC> the location is great .subway is next to the hotel and jr trainis just across the road . from airport train station to hotel is easy .it 's just 5 - 10 minutes walk .room quite small but comfortable .ameyoko market is in 10 minutes walking distance and there were many shops and restaurants around .if i go to tokyo , i 'll come back to stay here again ."

76,", very comfortable and amazing stay .the room was spacious and very comfortable .shower was very good .nice buffet breakfast , good wifi, very calm away from city center , front desk was quick overall very nice hoteland i recommend this hotel . </DOC> we were booked in here during the basel watch - fair , and prices were astronomical .well , for that , i was expecting more than a standard courtyard .at a normal courtyard price , it would have been - adequate .now i realise this is n't the hotel 's problem per se , its local market drivers on room availability .but a few nice touches would n't have gone amiss .as it was - you ca n't order room service from your room .you have to come down to the restaurant to order .and the checkout took forever - partly because of the prepayment .i would not rush to return - even outside the exhibition season . </DOC> all the staff i met was very young , rather inexperienced and with a very approximate command of english .the booking was done under someone else with the same name as me ( a first ) , the tv 's maximum sound level was barely audible , the fridge was empty , and most shockingly , i ca n't believe that they expect people to be able to shower with such a small bottle of ( cheap on the top of it ) shower gel .no fresh orange juice for breakfast as well , big faux pas .quite a shame because otherwise the place is new .dinner was ok . </DOC> typical business hotel .clean and comfortable .window can open ( fresh air , but also sound of trains / traffic ) .surroundings not great .walk to train station .taxi can be ordered . </DOC> i have paid less for the swissotel or the three kings in basel .and this is not worth it and is poor by comparison .as others have said this is in an industrial park on the outskirts from pratteln and about ten minutes walk to the train station .the walk is not pretty and i would not want to do it alone at night .the hotel is clean with well designed , colourful , practical lines and the room and facilities were fine .the staff were friendly and helpful on every occasion .my room had all i needed and the bed was comfortable .overall this is an ok hotel of its typebut you can find much better for the money . </DOC> after recovering from the extremely costly taxi ride from the airport i received a warm welcome at the courtyard .the hotel has a very modern decor and the rooms and public areas are nice and clean .my room was nice with a lovely bed .the only downside was the lack of room service , carrying my 30chf salad to my room did feel a little out of place . </DOC> we booked the package deal with the family room and had a great time together at the aquabasilea .we had a light dinner at the waterpark and stayed till 22.00 hrs .there 's a gas - station with a shop very near byand we bought some food and drinks which we enjoyed in the room which was fun too . </DOC> we were told nothing could be done until the morning . to speak to front desk in morning in the morning there was just one lady who went to inform me that she could n't help as she was newand they werewas no else one to help to add insult to injury elite status with spg / marriott counts for nothing .no free breakfast etca real customer service nightmare .the rooms are ok .however air conditioning does n't come on until you put keycard on so rooms on a warm day like todayare roasting shamethere is no hilton in basel ."
77,"great rooms , nice size .very comfortable bed and very clean .parking and internet is very expensive .the wellness area is the best i have ever seen .food and service are very good and staff is helpful .the location is n't great , about 20 minutes away from basel . </DOC> this hotel is standard courtyard with clean rooms friendly staff and swiss prices .it ’s great corporate hotel .the breakfast is very below par for money even at reduced rate you are paying . </DOC> the friendly staff checked us in fairly quickly .our room was dark and very basic , considering the price .the bed was relatively comfortable with non - feather pillows ( allergy sufferers thank you ! ) .the shower ( only ) had some mold ; it could use a good scrubbing from housekeeping .the water pressure was good and the hot water stayed hot throughout the duration of the shower .the magnifying mirror was a nice touch .the free wifi worked well .i might first check what 's available elsewhere before staying here again . </DOC> for us is was convenient to our plans for the next day .the entire hotel staff , from the front desk the servers in the restaurant and the staff at the buffet were very friendly and attentive to our needs during our stay .our room was very clean showing a little signs of wear .along with a great free buffet breakfast we were offered train tickets into basel .the food in the hotel restaurant was very well prepared and very tasty .in all it was a nice stay . </DOC> in general good , but the whole parking situation is quite confusing and there was an issue with a person in the restaurant which made me speechless , but the management reacted the next day in such a kind and professional way that i will spare this .when i booked the hotel i thought , wow they have a huge spa and pool areaservice at check - in and check - out was exceptional . </DOC> very friendly staff , which has give a warm welcome .room was nice and clean , bed allowed a good sleep , pillows needs getting used to .a variation would be good , here .they serve a good breakfast for a perfect start in the day .a recommenable place to stay .would select this hotel again . </DOC> it ’s very hard for marriott to deliver less than the standard of excellence , yes the hotel is basic marriott but still the service was excellent .i booked leveraging my points and it was very smooth using the application and in less than 2 minutes .the lady at the reception in the afternoon shift was very helpful </DOC> the reception was very friendly and helpful .the room was fine as was the bathroom .the bed was comfortable but the room temperature was very difficult to control and had a mind of its own .room wifi was included in the room rate and was very good .the selection of tv channels was also surprisingly varied .the charge for phone calls from the room was 3.5 sf per minute which was incredibly expensive .the bar was pleasant ( except for the prices ) and the barman very friendly .breakfast was average with a very poor toaster that took for ever to produce brown toast .switzerland is very expensive , particularly with the recent increase in the value of the franc , and this must be kept in mind when considering value for money ."
78,"we spent two nights here , from checking in , directions to where the car park is , how to use the public transport , everything is done effectively and professional !staff at reception gave me some amazing tips of places to visit while there !bedroom is clean , spacious enough and quiet .however , staff at breakfast are verging on the point of being rude , no greetings , no acknowledgementand if you dare ask for anything that is finish , you get told they know and that they are busy !there were friendly staff for sure , unfortunately i never got their names but the majority stood out as unfriendly and stressed ! </DOC> very nice hotel and rooms , very good breakfast , tea and coffee facilities and minibar in the room .it could be a perfect vacation .the main problem is the houskeeping .rooms were not arranged , coffee and teabags were not supplied everyday , and somehow it looked like there was no supervision .other problem is the location .industrial facilities and logistic warehouses .a mcdonalds 500 m ' away .a gas station with minimarket nearby and that s all .there is no free pool in the hotel . </DOC> the room being at the end of the hall or corner equates to having a very roomy room .the mattress was a little too firm for my preference .only downside is not having breakfast or aquabasilea fees included .there is an open parking site for a fee next to the hotel / aquabasilea .front desk check in was a breeze .we were given a city map along with mobility ticket for discounted admission to local attractions and unlimited free use of the basel 's public transportation such as trains , trams , and buses .it would have been great if we were given the option for free mobility ticket or admission to aquabasilea .i would have chosen the latter since i already had my own transportation . </DOC> i have stayed here on business multiple times and have always felt satisfied with the quality of the hotel and the helpful staff .the hotel is located outside of basel which requires you either taking a taxi or having a car to get to .overall the hotel has a large meeting area where you can meet with friends and colleagues .the morning breakfast area is large and offers a large variety of breakfast options .my room was clean and had a modern décor feel and the bed was comfortable .overall good stay . </DOC> it ’s basic clean and functional .rooms are clean and has all the amenities you need the only complaint is breakfastwhat a rip off .not quality and for the price definitely not worth it .but it ’s switzerland where everything is expensive . </DOC> this hotel is close to basel but your have to have a carotherwise it is in the middle of nowhere .when you arrive the parking is way overpricedbut there is not alternative .the rooms are fine but the airco does not work .whatever i tried the rooms stayed at a temparature level that was too warm .since you do not have a lot of alternatives regarding restaurants in the neighbourhood you eat in the hotel .this place is called max restaurant bar & lounge and is filled with incompetent waiters .ordered a ceasar salad with chicken and got one with shrimps .did not order extra water and tried to bring it two times .did not order coffee but came with coffee twice .this did not happen to me only but also at the table next to me .the price - quality of the food is not in line and would recommend not to eat in the hotel </DOC> i absolutely loved everything about this hotel except for it 's location .the bottom line , do n't stay here if you are planning on seeing basel .now , for the pluses - the staff was awesome , my premium room was absolutely impressive with a really cool coffee maker , the patio outside was really nice to enjoy the summer . </DOC> one night overlay , very modern and spotless . friendly and efficient staff .convenient snacks and easy checkout .bathroom was modern and clean with a great shower .bed was very comfortable"
79,"the staff are fantastic , shame about the few kids running around the nighttook forever to get served in the bar but the burger was great when it arrived , did n't look at the menu in the restaurant area , although i assume it was more extensive than the menu in the bar .rooms are spacious , clean and seem quite new , although i think the hotel is new rather than refurbished .i 'll probably stay again if i ' m in the area . </DOC> we went on holidays to tuscany and needed to break the long drive in two ; this hotel was ideally located and the service was great .but we could leave all our valuable stuff in the car in a safe parking and just had to talk a toothbrush into our rooms ; i would certainly use it again in the future . </DOC> i agree with the other folks saying it is a little always from the city 's core but , worth the distance .quality is high , property is modern and well kept .rooms are greati would recommend to anyone . </DOC> we decided to do a one day stop in basel to see the old town area .this hotel was great , but it is not in old town .the hotel will give guests a travel card / pass good on all trains , buses , and trams in and out of the old city .the hotel room was very clean .the front desk staff was very helpful .the room was very nice , it had the following things : a us type outlet to charge electronics on the desk , an iron & ironing board , nespresso machine , and a very nice bathroom .the room was very quiet .the breakfast that came with our room rate was a very good buffet that had something for everyone .the bed was very comfortable .there are not restaurants right near the hotel .the front desk gave us walking directions to a very nice italian restaurant called "" ristorante da pippo "" </DOC> the hotel it self isgood , nice standard courtyard hotel nothing special but still top notch .the breakfast is expensive but good .they do nt offer room service wich is a negative in my eyes .and the location is not so great .you can take a tram to get downtown . </DOC> very nice hotel .the room was large and clean , although like many hotels the lighting is dim for reading anywhere but in the bed .the room was quiet even though it faced the highway .the front desk staff was very helpful at check in .the hotel is not in basel , but in prattiln , a substantial distance from the airport .the only attraction nearby seems to be the water park next door . </DOC> i do know the hotel for quite a while and regarding to my positive impressiona couple of months ago i now see some more things pointing to the opposite direction .here are some samples , during check out only one receptionist was presentthe room was clean but there were several markings of usage .the air conditioning was n't working properly . </DOC> not in the center , you will get from the hotel voucher for free ride on the tram .near by train and tram station .very good hitel , very clean , american style equiped .staff are very nice and helpgul .perfect dinners and breakfasts . free wi fi .the only missing thing in the room is watch to see the hour at night .loved the hotel ."
80,"the hotel is about 20 mins away from basel .it 's located next to the highway and the surroundings are in way of an industrial kind . if you get a room facing not to the highway the trail of trains become your friend .the rooms are modern nice furnished and clean .the breakfast is average , for switzerland it 's even a kind of disappointing .a highlight when it 's included is the big pool area with sauna and gym .the connection downtown is possible with a free trampass upon the checkin . </DOC> everything still in good shape , however you can see , that the bathrooms are getting a bit worn out .service is still ver good andthe breakfast buffet excellent . </DOC> we had a nice stay in this hotel and can not really understand the negative reviews ..yes it is in the outskirts of baselbut it is a quick drive into town .it has the advantage to be next door to aquabasel which is a big plus if you want to enjoy this fantastic water complex .it is also well located to explore some nice villages nearby .the hotel is modern and nicely decorated .the rooms were clean and spacious .staff is also very nice and overall service is excellent . </DOC> the room was comfortable .the staff was helpful and the food at the restaurant was acceptable .my only gripe is that the location makes for a difficult to spend your free time .it is in the middle of no - where switzerland . finding a taxi or transportation to ' down town ' basel was a challenge .when you find one , the cost to go anywhere is a small mortgage . </DOC> nice hotel and standard expectation from a courtyard by marriott .front staff very friendly and helpful with directions to basel city center - accessible by tram in 20 minutes and walkable to tram station .room was big and ok , nothing special .no trash can liner in the bathroom trash can which is disgusting !this is gross ! and a health hazard .rediculous thin in the bathroom isthe shower is a half door - which means the floor gets wet when you shower .why not a full shower door ?is this suppose to be cool or trendy ?what is cool about a wet bathroom floor ?room had a fridgebut it was stocked with booze , beer , etc .they have an attached restaurant with outrageous pricing !do n't eat thereis you cherish your wallet .wifi seemed fast ! !overall not a bad option . </DOC> this hotel is far superior to the standard courtyards of us version .very large and well appointed rooms , good restaurant and bar , friendly staff etc .it ’s 30 minutes to basel city center via metroand they provide free metro and rail pass for guest for duration of stay .it ’s only 10 minutes to central train station .not much around the hotel other than few restaurants and spa . </DOC> and overall very had a pleasant stay .hotel is a little far away from basel , but easily reachable by car , tram or train .all facilities are very good .tram and train station is 10 - 15 min walk , depends on how fast u walk :-)takes around 20 min to rach basel city center . </DOC> ... you pay an additional chf26/day ( you can also get it by the hour ) and have a calm work space in your room , or you go and sit in the ( albeit spacious ) lobby where wifi is free .that 's kinda substandard .there 's an aquacomplex on the premises , immediately accessible from within the hotel .there 's a small gym in the hotel included in the price .the bed and pillows were ok .the room spacious .but i was a bit disappointed to find a cracked sink in the bathroom .the young lady at the reception was really kind , smiley and professional .kudos for her .decent breakfast and a restau that serves reasonably priced dishes ."
81,"clean , quiet , comfortable , great staff , beaut restaurant in the hotel .these places have no frills but are real value for money . </DOC> check in fast and efficient , room typical premier inn , clean and spacious .but it just moved the warm air around .we had a room facing the car park and the main roadfood at both breakfast anddinner was superb” this is well worth it if you order the dearest items on the menu , if you do not eat much or want cheaper items on the menu it may not pay you .chairs in the bar area were worn and dirty , otherwise the hotel was clean and in a good state of repair . </DOC> we enjoy staying at this hotel because it is conveniently situated for visiting relatives .a big plus on our latest visit was that a separate sheet was provided in the room in casebut who wants to trail down to reception in the middle of the night ?however , on this occasion we did find that the bed was rather hard , and also the extractor fan in the bathroom was very noisy when in use .otherwise , the hotel provided us with a clean bedroom and bathroom and the receptionist was friendly and helpfulso we had yet another pretty good stay </DOC> a little disappointed when we arrived as car park was full of "" white vans "" .even the receptionist asking if we wanted her to move her car so that we got a space !what a great welcome .all staff were friendly and helpful in the hotel without exception .cooked breakfast excellent , continental breakfast excellent .would stay there again without question ( but maybe avoiding weekdays ... ) </DOC> we were most pleasantly surprised .very efficient and friendly staff and large clean bedroom and bathroom . would have given 5 points except there is quite a bit of noise from the nearby a14 , even in the rooms on the other side away from the road . </DOC> we stayed at this hotel as a stopover on the way to norwich .it is not in the centre of townthe room was very good as expected and even had a sheet to use instead of the duvet which we were very glad of at itwe had the sirloin steak which was extremely good and far exceeded our expectations !i would definitely stay here again . </DOC> stayed one night as a stopover on our way to southwold . due to traffic problems on the road , we were running very late .and it was a treat to arrive to a very warm welcome , thank you ali .this time however , it was very comfortable , possibly because it was a very cold night in junewe had the most comfortable nights sleep we ’it was a very nice experienceless good - poor quality ingredients meant the offerings to be truly bland and tasteless .staff were nice but appeared totally overrun . </DOC> parking is free ( well done premier inn ) but wifi is only free for 30 minutes ( not so good but at least it 's only £ 3 thereafter ) .premier inns are perfectly acceptable hotel experiences but they have a tendency to have very variable prices depending on occupancy levels .a group of us ate in the restaurant and it was very good - the staff were good fun too .i will stay again if the need arises ."
82,"for this visit , as with all the others , the reception staff were very friendly and helpful .our room was clean and comfortable at a reasonable price so what more do you need for an excellent stay ?we shall certainly use this hotel again </DOC> staff are all very friendly , our room was clean and comfortable .easy to get to many places from here .be aware that this seems to be mainly a hotel for workmen / buisnessmen .car park full of white vans , that leave early .staff need to monitor the smoking outside the front door . despite a sign saying not to smoke near the door , workmen were smoking there . </DOC> everything functions well ; routine menu ; staff cheerful ; this particular one was very good value in terms of the room price </DOC> great from beginning to end - very friendly at reception , room big and bed most comfortable .breakfast on bh monday was a bit chaotic but apologies were duly made by the waiters / waitresses .at the price we paid - £ 35 per night - i would certainly stay again if needing to be in the area overnight . </DOC> the formalities were quickly accomplished by the night portera very comfortable , large bed .clean bedroom and bathroom .no road noise ( even though the website does give a warning ) , so a good night 's rest .an excellent budget hotel . </DOC> this is a good example of a premier inn , helpful staff , rooms as expected .bear in mind , this is a drive away from the town , not far from a busy road , but set in countryside . free parking on site .good food . would stay here again if in the area , you may find less expensive b&b in the town if you have time to look / review choices . </DOC> visiting family in the area over christmas and with a room at £ 29 this was ideal .did n't eat here so can not comment on previous reviewers comments , but guy on check in was friendly and efficient and room was top class .very clean with an excellent bed and very large television . </DOC> good basic accommodation at a very reasonable cost .easy to find and lots of parking .rooms very clean and facilities adequate for an overnight stay .on site bar - /bistro had an ok menu - ca n't recall what i had ( 3 weeks ago ) but it was fine !"

84,"my experience was as good as the other reviews say - comfortable bed and all the usual and reliable premier inn aspects .the staff in particular are 5* - very helpful and kind .very good value as i booked ahead which is the best way of securing a good price .it had freeview but was missing a lot of good channels like sky news and channel 10 .great wide screen however and all brand new by the look of it .anyway , these are small things and with such an excellent staff they will always sort anything out i am sure . </DOC> this hotel was fantastic and one of the best i have stayed in for ages , the staff were great , the food was well presented and tasted perfect , rooms were clean and the sleep was refreshing and blissfull </DOC> just off main road , but very quiet , receptionist very welcoming and informative .hotel basic but clean and serviceablebreakfast was lovely , freshly cooked . </DOC> staying as normal on business in this premier inn , just off the a14 so good position , no noise from the road standard pi rooms , older hotelso a bit more basic than some , thyme restaurant on site was good , food as others , service very prompt , all good will use again </DOC> the only downside to our stay here was the proximity to the main road .the a14 is a very busy dual carriagewayso there was constant traffic noise throughout our stay .if you can manage the noise , the hotel is just fine .the usual pi standard of accommodation and service is complemented by excellent value .an excellent fan was provided as well as sheets as an alternative to the usual duvet .both dinner and breakfast were good and great value for the quality .the restaurant is fairly small so booking recommended . </DOC> james on reception was very friendly and helpful .our room was at the back of the hotel , so was very quiet .clean and comfortable .there is ample to eat on the buffet style continental section .refillable tea or costa coffee .a very enjoyable stay . </DOC> having stayed in numerous premier inns around the uk , for me the attraction is you know what to expect , nice large clean rooms , a good bathroom and excellent staff service all at reasonable rates .the premier inn at claydon is situated just north of ipswich an ideal spot to tour suffolk , despite being a stones throw from the busy a14it is located in a very quite spot with excellent access to all routes .this particular premier inn is currently undergoing some refurbishment including all new beds and fittings which will further enhance any future stay , it also has its own in - house restaurant serving a good selection of breakfast and evening meals , my only criticism is the tables for two are small and very close together so do not expect any intimacy or privacy . </DOC> this , much like other premier inns is located close to a main road , the a14 in this case .it is very convenient from ipswich and the surrounding area butbeware , if you like to leave your window open at night there can be traffic noise .sake for a room on the quiet side .otherwise , usual standard of room , clean with plenty of room .the staff were very friendly and helpful , as i have one to expect from an above average budget hotel ."

88,"staff were very welcoming and helpful , rooms clean and comfortable andfood was excellent both for breakfast and dinner .wi - fi was free for 30 mins .parking was ample good value for money </DOC> a very polite woman said that it was n't an issue and to just ring the bell outside and the night porter would let us in .when we got there we were totally knackered and after ringing the bell , the night porter let us in very quickly .my room was very spacious , exceptionally clean and very comfy .there were 2 different types of pillow , 2 towels and a lovely flat screen tv .i slept really well as it was very quiet with no noise at allthe second night we had a drink in the bar which was cosy and nice - the bar staff were lovely .i actually booked 3 nights but checked out after 2 as i was able to get away from the work event early .there 's a massive tescos quite close by </DOC> a secluded / remote spot just off the a14 .ideal base for touring the area .small bar area .restaurant is within the hotel , not a ' pub ' attached to it which made a wonderful change .we had a ground floor room facing the car park which although a wonderfully spacious , clean room , we did get disturbed around 6 am with early risers leaving . ample parking . </DOC> the hotel was not difficult to find and the reception was friendly and efficient .the room was large , clean and comfortable with a large , new television .dinner ( as part of a package ) was good , and the staff were hard working and good natured .we had to wait a long time for our cooked breakfast , which was fresh and tasty when it arrived , but the hotel should consider a hot buffet ( the continental breakfast is bufffet ) . </DOC> firstly this is 100 % genuine . stayed here at the good old premier inn ..... as usual reliable .... comfortable ... but ... rather drab and predictablei also think the bathroom should have a heater .always clean especially the bedclothesand that 's very important .staff are usually always reliable too .hope this does n't upset anyone just trying to help . </DOC> plenty of free parking at the hotel .although next to a14 quite quiet and secluded , although new business being built next door .staff very friendly and welcoming .rooms usual pi set up ... clean , comfortable , decent size , most facilities you 'll need .beds very comfy , decent bath / shower . </DOC> i ' ve stayed in .the restaurant was good and the breakfast was fantastic .poached eggs often test a busy breakfast kitchen , but this chef really passed the test with perfectly cooked eggs .best of all every member of staff was cheerful , helpful and seemed happy to be there - they are a credit to the hotel . </DOC> it 's part of the premier inn chain and the rooms look identical to anywhere else in the chain .staff at the front desk were friendly and helpful .the building is a low rise and next to a dual carriageway .some of the rooms face out onto the major road , while others face into the car park .we had a room facing the car park and found it all very quiet -no idea what the sound - proofing is like against the main road though .the hotel is not near anything else at all - to reach anything ( even the smallest of shops or a pub ) you absolutely have to drive - the nearest town of non - trivial size i think is needham market and is about 5 miles away overall - usual high standard from the chain .this will do fine"
89,"we received a professional and friendly welcome on a cold winter ’s night but our room was clean fresh and warm .more was available at reception .we only had breakfast and would find it hard to find any fault with that .fantastic location right next to the main road but far enough away that you will not get disturbed by traffic noise . </DOC> the hotel is very clean and staff are extremely friendly especially restaurant staff .. had room on ground near entrance and was noisey and kept waking our children up ..not a great nights sleep ..the breakfast was excellent andwould stay again but not on floorwe had this time ... </DOC> not very well lit and in dark unless u been before it can be hard to spot .bit off the beaten track it felt and as u drive up u are welcomed to cordoned off zone as the roof at the entrance is falling of onto the pavement .staff are friendly but lacks any atmosphere .parking is ample and the breakfast was ok and quick .but it does what it says in the tin </DOC> stayed here many times and always enjoyed it .staying just down road and so decided to pop in for dinner one evening .great service , food very good , and prices reasonable .can recommend the firecracker noodles . </DOC> i did wonder whether noise from the adjacent a14 would filter into the hotel , but at night , even with the window slightly open it was deathly quiet , so a great nights sleep until the elephants in the room above started moving around at 7 pm .very friendly and helpful staff , and their ' thyme ' restaurant was in the same building , so no need to walk out in the rain to eat .i think ' thyme ' is the best of whitbread 's eateries andbreakfast was also good , with the food cooked to order .all in all , another winner for premier inn . </DOC> the staff were excellent , when i phoned to say we would be arriving quite late the lady i spoke to took all our details and updated our booking to show our late arrival .upon arrival the lady on reception was very friendly and efficient , she really gave the impression she cared .the room was typical premier inn , and pretty clean and tidy .the beds comfortable , and bathroom clean and tidy .the restaurant staff during breakfast deserve a special mention .the restaurant was very busy but they were calm and efficient and got everyone seated and took orders quickly .and i would happily stay here again . </DOC> another business trip made easier by premier inn .ipswich north has an interesting location nestled down by the side of the a14 .access could n't be easier as it is quite literally 60 seconds off the dual carriageway .you 'd not think so though as the only noise i could hear most of the time was the tweeting of birds .somewhat of a surprise !there 's plenty of car parking spaces ( a good 50 % of which seemed to be taken by company vans on this occasion ! ) and the welcome at reception was the usual pleasant one provided by premier inn staff .ve come to expect .clean , spacious , large flat screen tv on the fall , sofa ( chaise style ) and a reasonably modern bathroom . </DOC> the rooms are typical premier inn rooms , with all the usual facilities .all was clean apart from a bathroom towel issue , which was quickly rectified .the other room was apparently all very good .however , on a warm weekend , i found my room stiflingly hot .this meant that the noise from the a14 - busy through the night - was a real problem ."
90,"this hotel does n't have the local charm of many in ethiopia , but it has high european standards and is a nice place to stay .the hotel building is a modern multi - story , with amazing views over lake awassa especially for sunset .some of the rooms overlook the lake with a balcony , which is well worth asking for .the hotel has gardens leading down to the lake side and a lobby bar with perfect sunset views .the rooms are clean , spacious , with reliable electricity and hot water .bathroom is not quite as good as the bedroom , but it was mostly clean and had good water pressure and hot water .double bed was a good size with a very comfy mattress .very wide choice , egg station , variety of fruit and juice etc .the main complains would be 1 ) location - not convenient to walk in to town . </DOC> ethiopians are proud of this resort and the man behind the namebut i do n't think the management company is doing this place justice .the grounds are nice and well kept but the interior is starting to look dated and a little grungy . upon entering my roomi found a broken fan , broken fridge , broken shower head and a power strip that sported 6 or 7 outlets ... with only one of them functioning .on the positive side the bed was quite comfortable .the food in the restaurant was average but way overpriced .not a great value at all .the only thing that i noticed was slower than the service was the internet .i found several locations around town where i was able to get faster and more reliable free internet than was possible inside the resort .overall this property was a let down and the next time i 'i 'll be looking into other options . </DOC> this was the best hotel on the tour .it is modern with all of the modern amenities .the staff was friendly and helpful .the room i had faced the lake and the pool .the room was large , clean and bright .very modern , the bathroom had all of the usual expected amenities .air conditioning in the room was very good .the bar and sitting area near the pool was very attractive and pleasant .two issues though : soundproofing between room and between the room and the hall was quite poor .the second night was quiet .unfortunately it is quite far from the very nice city canterand there are no sidewalks to useshould you wish to visit the city .the hotel has very nice shops featuring local handicrafts that are well priced .apart from these two issues this is a good hotel to use when in hawassa . </DOC> the haile resort offers international standard accommodation and a choice of dining experiences either inside , lakeside , or looking over the lake .the portions , in the restaurant , are large and extremely satisfying and the beers cheap .if sitting on the large terrace be aware that service is somewhat slow and that taking the shade of the trees brings with it the hazard of being bombed by the birds who feed on the buds and shoots of the tree !a great place to while away a sunny afternoon overlooking this beautiful stretch of water . </DOC> only stayed one night , our room overlooked the car park , although it was cleanit was rather cramped ., the gardens looked very attractive .although there was a buffet dinner available we opted for the a - la - carte menu , the food was resonable and well presented .but there was a limited continental choice .restaurant staff were very polite and efficient . </DOC> we stayed again here because we love it .the resort is a beautiful hotel located by the lake .the pool area and the garden beneath it are great andgoing to the pool and garden around 6 pm is great to view the sun set .especially , relaxing by the lake garden under the trees is very refreshing .the rooms and other facilities meet everyone ’s standard .the rooms by the lake view are excellent .wifi is available everywhere but sometimes it drops down .it could be due to power interruption andthe restaurant serves delicious food both ethiopian and european .they have a special menu called “ agelgil ” and it is very tasty assorted ethiopian food , eaten in a group .lunch , dinner and snacks are delicious but not the breakfast .services are very good , staffs are friendly and attentive . </DOC> compared to everything else in ethiopia this place is the shangri - la - and the price is not much more than we paid at other places however the service and rooms are 100 times better .the rooms were clean, the service good , the beds excellent , the shower to die for ( ie hot water and pressure ) , the wifi worked and was fast , and , to top it all off , they actually took credit cards .dinner was the big disappointment - the food was cold when it arrived .the taste might have been ok but when you are eating cold mashed potates and gravy it just ruins the whole experience .breakfast was also a disappointment .it was a buffet but nothing appeared that appetizing .they did made to order eggsbut again nothing special . </DOC> what a pleasant experience .the hotel is really 5 stars in ethiopia - service- staff - rooms - dining - facilities .rooms overlooking the lake - we saw a family of 6 hippos from our balcony !the room is perfect .the food and service in both the dining room and the bar / lounge are very good .the service and pricing on the spa are excellent .a place to return to ."
91,"pleasant clean room with balcony overlooking the lake .nice bathroom with warm if not hot water .this is the good part .when you leave your room ( except for the lovely grounds ) the problems start .furniture in the lounge is worn and grungy .i think locals think this is the upscale place to beso it is a mob scene with many people who are not staying here .so we ordered a haile pizza ( 4 ingredients : beef , garlic , mushrooms and olives ) .waitress says it will take 5 minutes .25 minutes later we got the pizza with a very soggy crust . </DOC> this is a lovely spot to decompress after hard travel in the surrounding area .the hotel is quiet , have a lovely view of the awasa lake and has decent quality rooms ( clean , large ) .most important this was the first place in ethiopia that various social media was n't blocked ( e.g. fb ) .the staff was professional and attentive . </DOC> i stayed for two days with my family and the service i received was excellent .the manager and other reception staffs made sure that our stay was pleasant and comfortable by asking us if we needed anything .rooms are clean and the view is nice .i had a wonderful tasty dinners .the lodging price is competitive and affordable once in a while .those who would like to visit the lovely city of awassa ( hawassa ) , haile resort should be one of your choices . </DOC> we spent one night in this hotel on our way back from bale to addis ababa and it was a very nice stop .the hotel is on the lake and the view is very nice .our room was clean and comfortable and the food was all right .from here you can easily visit the lake and the local fish market . positive . </DOC> the place is new and quite pleasant with a swimming pool , tennis , "" spa "" , bars , several restaurants , boutiques etc ... and they are obviously trying hard to offer all the facilities of a big brand hotel .the rooms still look new and are nicely furnished .all this comes for less than half of the price of a very average hotel in addisso we were quite happy to relax there for one night after the harsher conditions of the bale mountains .of course not everything was perfect : the service was average and we were far from the fine dining of southern france or the charm of tuscanybut well ... this is central ethiopia and there are not many places like this in the country !the only real bad point is that the hotel is rather far from the city center , so you 'll need a vehicle or good shoes . </DOC> very large and very busy .breakfast buffet was best we had in ethiopia with many options .room was modern and very nice .pool big enough for lengths but quite difficult to see as pool water is dark ( but clean ) .good lake views . </DOC> this is a well equipped hotel in a lovely lakeside setting .the meals were good , the staff very helpful and friendly .an enjoyable stay . </DOC> you can feel comfortable at a pretty high level without 5 stars hotels pressure .food good , breakfast good , room and toilets very good , garden and lake awesome .on the lake shores you will find hundred of birds and 50 meters wide unbelievable trees .here we met for the first time me haile ( in a portrait , in fact ) ."

96,"the staff have always been great and this time was no exception .all are very friendly and helpful .the food is very tasty and reasonably priced .the pub was built as part of the original ' model village ' , ironically as a temperance hall !other recent reviewers have mentioned that the accommodation needs updating .this is a bit of an understatement .a major refurbishment needs to be undertaken .the rooms are ' tired ' and shabby , as are the staircases and landings .perhaps the brewery should consider doing the updating or alternatively simply cease letting out the rooms and concentrating on the pub / restaurant .if nothing is done , we will probably stay in another hotel nearby but will certainly visit the bridge for a great meal and a drink served by great staff . </DOC> my last visit to the bridge was "" grim "" to the extent i vowed i would never again go .and it was very busy but credit where it is duethe food was amazing and came sooner than the delay explained and at no point was there a queue at the bar .there was no nothing i could fault this visit on ... service , quality of food in particular the ribs amazing and for the price .on the basis of this visit on this visit i will be back again . </DOC> we had lunch here after visiting the wonderful lady lever museum .the bridge inn is a large , well - run pub with friendly helpful staff .the best thing you can say about the food is that it 's cheap .the total bill for our lunch for four , including drinks , came to about £ 20 ! . </DOC> the good : extremely good value , the price was definitely right .the staff were friendly and attentive the breakfast was good and substantial .the location is truly excellent with easy access to the village of port sunlight ( you are right in it ) , and also the unilever facilities .the not so good : fish and chips with mushy peas for dinner were just ok , and i had the misfortune of staying here during a bachelorette party or something .so sleep was a bit difficult .if i had been younger , maybe i would have found it more interesting . </DOC> we had read about the annual port sunlight festival in our local liverpool echo , and as we are smitten with the village , we decided to go and make a day ( and night ) of it .first of all , let me praise the staff , and especially the owners , who were very friendly and catered for all of our needs .the meals were good plain food , well cooked and served to our liking .the cost of the food was very reasonable , and great value for money .the bedroom and bathroom were clean , with plenty of towels , linen and pillows .we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend the hotel to our friends . </DOC> only visited for a snack and a drink in the middle of port sunlight village a good place to visit lots of character and history , the pub is full of charm very nice staff and the food is tasty and good value , the lady lever gallery is free , you can donate a small fee if you want , and well presented , the whole port sunlight experience is great a full day out if you wantedtake visitors or go if you have not seen it , the inn also has rooms if you want to stay . </DOC> set in port sunlight village this is the historic pub which the villagers voted at the start of the 20th century should sell beer though the founder lord lever wanted it to be alcohol free .the building is huge and striking the bar is also very beautiful with concave wooden bar .the food is a flaming grill with seniors menu children’s menu gluten free menu and extensive main menu .well worth the money .service is fast and friendly the staff work hard .with drinks it was well worth the £ 18 we paid . </DOC> our room was huge and very comfortable .the view from one window was out over a park and the other was over the graveyardthe room was spotless and the bed comfy .we had lunch in the restaurant which was well cooked and served and reasonably priced .the staff were friendly , we were in the area for a funeral and the peace and tranquility of port sunlight was ideal for us .would we return ?, we just hope it will be in happier circumstances ."
97,"great value , clean and modern , comfortable and well located .very good staff and breakfast buffet .overall much better than a travelodge and much cheaper .good to arrive by boat as you can tie up directly by the hotel . </DOC> we were in the conservatory part which looked out to the broads .lovely views .its a carvery here and was delicious .would recommend this place .staff were friendly .boat hire here as well . </DOC> and it was one of the best ever , there was 7 different vegatables big homemade yorkies 4 different meats lovely roast spuds and all the trimmings .so we had room for the lovely apple pie, the only sad thing was they microwaved the pie </DOC> the hotel is in a great location at the end of the broad , the rooms have been refurbished and the staff are friendly .the food lets it down - dinner was cheap but poor - there was an advert for a new chef in the hotelbreakfast was ok but had been standing for a long time - it needs to be cooked freshly .with some work on the food it could be an excellent hotel but at the moment i would recommend eating out - there are a few restaurants in the village . </DOC> modern clean room with several electrical sockets .bed was comfy and modern bathroom with powerful shower and nice view out towards the broads .the following day was good all staff friendly and helpful . would happily stop here again at the price i paid but not at the listed prices they want </DOC> ate here on friday night whilst in the area and had a really excellent lamb shank so returned on sunday night and had the worst meal we have ever had .my husbands ribs were so hard he could not get either a knife or his teeth through them .we complained and the ribs were re - cooked leaving the rest of the plate of food ( very dry over - cooked half of chicken ) to get cold .most people obviously eat from the carvery and that seems to be fine so , in conclusion , go for the carvery but steer clear of the rest of the menu .i think our excellent lamb shank was just a fluke ! !lovely setting , right by the broads but food hit and miss ( hence my title ! ) must also add that the restaurant was busier on the friday than the sunday so that does n't explain the difference in food quality either ? </DOC> room was a good size , bed was comfortable , pillows were great ! !bathroom was a good size , loads of hot water and a shower that worked well .room overlooked the car park and road / footpath .breakfast was fine , all the usual items , well cooked and well presented .would stay here again . </DOC> we went to werry for sunday lunch .must say just an average meal we had carvery two of us bland meat vegone of us had steak pie crust very hard over cooked.one of ushad fish pie very nice.staff polite atmospheregood but let down by poor quality meat.lots of competition in village , will try one of themfirst.i say this as main course not cheap.willwe go back no ."
98,"it looked out over the car park , was not very big ,the bathroom however was a good size and clean and tidy .the food was ok , husband had the carvery , which is quiet good value .breakfast was not wonderful , as it is kept warm from being cooked earlier .it seems lots of locals use this as a breakfast restaurantwould have been great to sit outside as it was a beautiful evening but the bench type tables are not comfortable for this .would we go back....... it is convenient for our needsbut we will look at other locations next time . </DOC> but that was no problem .good sized room which scored very highly on my number of plug sockets / tea bags scale , although would not be suitable for anyone with mobility issues due to long winding trek along corridors with a number of small flights of ( 3 or 4 ) stairs .good value carvery available in restaurant , and fairly good if not exceptional breakfast .reception was happy to print me a 15 - 20 page document without charge before i left in the morning . </DOC> sitting right beside the waters edge the wherry is a very nice place to be on a sunny day .reception were friendly and efficient as were all the staff we encountered .there are a couple of pubs , indian and chippy just over the footbridge , plus cafes and boat hire ., it was large , clean and well equipedhowever the "" view "" was of a fire escape and kitchen ducting , and the excractor fans meant that opening the window made the room noisy .breakfast was buffet style and we found it very good , they will even cook eggs to order if you ask . despite my comments above the hotel is well worth a visit , just make sure you clarify what 's outside your window first , had we had some sort of view it would be close to 5 star . </DOC> the room ( mini suite ) was lovely , it was a good size , and it had a balcony with a fantastic view , well worth paying the money for an upgrade .the carvery food was very good and there is also a pub style menu as an alternative .staff were great , food was great and the room was perfect .we would rate this hotel a "" must visit "" . </DOC> overlooking the oulton broad is the wherry hotel .it offers overnight mooring with free water for £ 10 .we stayed the night on the mooring and enjoyed a tasty sirloin steak evening meal .so much steak is disappointing nowadays , but this was n't .the staff at the wherry were friendly and the service was good . </DOC> you can top up your water here free andjust over the other side of the bay there is a pump out facility .the staff seemed quite cheery and there is a nice park for the kids not to far away from there which will keep them occupied . </DOC> this hotel was chosen for convenience and at the price we were not expecting too much .however the hotel was very comfortable and well appointed and our room had everything needed for a comfortable stay and as a bonus superb views over the broads .i would highly recommend . </DOC> room 112 has a good size balcony ( with two chairs ) facing oulton broads .the bed is comfortable , with good quality cotton sheets .having the pub downstairs made it very easy to get ice for drinks on the balcony and the carvery is good value for money .the second night we eat at a very good indian restaurant , just across the lifting bridge at the side of the hotel .i would recommend it without hesitation if you are looking for a clean , comfortable place made very special by the wonderful views ."
99,"the staff are friendly and fun and the food .... the food , by way of a carvery - is just fantastic .outside you get to see the sun setting over the broadsand you 're very in town an 5 minutes from the beach .i would stay here again ! </DOC> spent 4 days here over the christmas period in a wood panelled suite with magnificent views over the marina and everitt park .the room itself was spacious with patio doors onto the balcony .the food was excellent and served by very friendly and helpful staff .three possible improvements would be for the staff to have name badges , the bath was deep making it difficult for those with short legs to get in and out andoverall an excellent stay and would hope to return . </DOC> although only booking standard doubles , the receptionist gave us lake - view rooms which were excellent , with their own balconies looking straight over the broad and the boats .great running routes from the hotel round the small park and out into the fens , along marked trials .the food is decent pub grub rather than haute cuisine , but it hits the spot for a night 's stay , and is very popular with locals and visitors alike .pretty good breakfast too ...we 'll be back ! </DOC> we had our very first stay at the hotel and had a lovely time , the rooms are big and comfy and nothing was too much for the staff .but there was a nice large lift, it was a bit difficult getting through the fire door into the lift as you had to do a bit of manoeuvring due to the landing being very close to the top of the stairs .another disappointing thing was the view from our room ( see pic below )we had been hoping to have a river viewthe bathroom was massive and had a walk in shower , just had to be careful on the flooring as it was a bit slippy .all in all we had a wonderful stay and will definitely go again </DOC> i am so glad as this is a really pleasant hotel .on arrival , both myself and my colleague were upgraded to ' rooms with a sea view ' .it was n't a sea view , it was a viewnice big double room with a balcony .large comfy bed , tv , tea and coffee facilities ( with hob nob and custard cream biscuits ) and good modern bathrooms .breakfast is reasonable . </DOC> i suppose arriving on a very wet afternoon does n't help ! !was n't entirely helped by the efficient , but less than friendly , receptionist especially when i asked for the room with a view which i thought i had booked to be told "" we 're full , and the wedding has booked everything "" our room faced the lock , and had a view of the broads .good - sized , relatively modern , all ok so far .unfortunately , if you8 have to open your window , ( as we did for some ventilation ) the noise of the traffic from dawn is pretty bad .however , to my surprise , it was excellent and at £ 12 for 2 courses you just ca nt beat that for value ! !breakfast looked nice , but sat out for hours in the buffet . </DOC> a very nice gesture .the room was large and also had a 2/3 seat sofa , coffee table , dressing table with the usual tea , coffee , biscuits and loads of plug sockets .the view was over the road and the car park ! !the bed , which i think was a king - size , was very comfortable as was my pillow .there was some traffic noise in the morning , only noticeable as we live in a cul de sac with no through traffic .lots of hot water , towels and small toiletries in the bathroom , my only observation would be that the bath was very slippery , possibly mats might be a help here ? </DOC> first the positives ; location lovely , great views , nice public areas if very food orientated and lovely , friendly staff .obviously extremely popular for day visitors and no doubt makes a fortune .ok but cheap furnishings , balcony filthy , full of fag buts and other rubbish , plus cheap plastic chairs , no table and not so much as a welcome folder in room , just a plastic card , not even a hair dryer or do not disturb sign .buffet breakfast not at all fresh or decent although the bar food looked nice .so in summary nice for a day trip but not a stay ."
