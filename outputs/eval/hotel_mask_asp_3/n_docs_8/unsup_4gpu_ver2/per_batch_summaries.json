        "docs": "special thanks to alex and yolaris at the front desk , and christopher at in room dining , all of whom helped make my stay especially pleasant .i will look forward to returning . </DOC> in a city where hotel service can be hit or miss , particularly at the high end , the mo stands out for truly exceptional service .my experience was , if they can do something to make your stay better , they will .the location is fantastic , with central park across the street , a private entrance to time warner center , and subway station 100 yards away .upper west side and the restaurants of hells kitchen are a very easy walk away .rooms are on the smaller side for a premium hotel , and the hudson river view rooms are a bit exposed to the hallway for my taste . </DOC> we have stayed in rooms facing either the hudson river or the central park .the view could greatly improved , if the trump hotel is shifted about fifty blocks to the left .the hardware of the hotel combines elements of the mo in las vegas such as the open lobby , it also has the grand view like the mo in tokyo and also the massive size of the dc property .the spa is also a real let down , i have had better massage at the local ymca for fraction of the price .the views of the central park from the restaurant is breathtaking , but when the regular f&b manager is not on duty , the food and service can be all over the place . </DOC> the aviary is the best part of the hotel \u2013 it is in the hotel but managed by the alinea group of chicago .stayed at the mandarin oriental on a long weekend in new york and have to say that this hotel is great .first location - perfect , next to central park which means great but more peaceful than time square second hotel - rooms are really nice , well finished and great service from the maids third bar - very expensive , normal for a 5 star hoteli suppose overall i would highly recommend this hotel for all visitors to new york , excellentthe mandarin oriental nyc is right by the columbus circle , very convenient and very good . </DOC> this hotel in new york is top notch and rivals the best in the city .location and views from the common areas , restaurants and conference rooms is quite spectacular .service as you might guess was also excellent . impressed and will be back .great location on south park west with nice view around .second , at this price point , i think there are several hotels in ny that are much nicer ( such as the park hyatt , the peninsula and st regis ) . </DOC> and you still in the heart of the city .great rooms overlooking the central park .though you have the other favourite hotel of mine , trump towers , blocking a bit of the view .more so , i love the viewsthis place is terrific . </DOC> we stayed in the central park view corner suite on the 51st view .great room with an excellent view .a guest bathroom is off the living area .good views from the bar and restaurant off the lobby .the hotel is just off columbus circle and across the street from central park . </DOC> get some nespresso machines !great location at columbus circle so can walk to many great shops and restaurants .hotel address is not where cars drop off .driver of car services had difficulty finding entrance without explicitly spelling out how to find it .from arrival to departure and everything that goes in the middle , a truly exceptional hotel , that even if for your drinks , lunch or supper .... you must visit if in manhattan .",
