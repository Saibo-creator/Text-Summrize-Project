        "docs": "the island was very nice , the reef was ok , the food in the restaurant was very nice .the staff on this island are very kind and obliging and will do anything to make your stay more comfortable .it was a shame to see emply bottles lying around and rubbish lying around generally , why on earth people want to just throw rubbish onto the floor never ceases to amaze meand they obviously have no respect at all .the staff were very good , they do have a slow pace , but that his their way and is the same on other islands . </DOC> however only one guy at the restaurant was quite cooperative who helped us to get good food .but again you have think twice before asking for any service even if you 're paying as they mostly in bad mood .our accommodation was immaculate and kept that way all week by the dedicated housekeeping staff .each member of staff we encountered were great and always happy to help a credit to their profession .i was happy with my room as it had a ceiling fan and the air conditioning worked well . </DOC> they have a lovely reception for returning guests , but i ' m afraid it 's doubtful we would return again .this island resort has beautiful beach but compared to other nearby resorts in the area ( e.g. , full moon ) , it is not as impressive .food is okay and staff are friendly .not a single staff has smile on his / her face .house keeping is useless . </DOC> we took the full board option and was very happy with the food , there was a constant change andon the other outlets the sand bar was by far the best ..the staff were attentive and friendly ... but go to the other side of the island and visit huvanthe staff just do nt care , they are also pretty useless at serving you ,the only way i could get a drink on my first night was to go get it myself . </DOC> email communications with the resort concerning transfers was effective and timely .we stayed in a deluxe room but were disappointed that it did not have the four poster bed shown in all the brochures .the curries were tasty but not as spicy as i would like .but that 's not really the point of the maldives .about half of the guests at the resort are chinese , most of whom appear to be hard of hearing . </DOC> a - absolutely fabulous , attentative and courteous staff .from checkin to checkout , we \u2019 ve had our queries and questions answered in the most professional manner .all the staff are extremely polite , courteous and obliging .all the staff were very friendly and always said hello or asked how we were , from the gardeners to the spa staff ( which i visited twice for back massages ) .the lady greeter in the restaurant always knew which villa numbers we were in and the waiter hassan was attentive and decorated our table beautifully for my birthday . </DOC> the service by everyone at the resort was fantastic as well .in any case , thank you to all the staff at bandos for a wonderful stay !i had read up on the resort and was happy to hear that they had a great house reef ( love to snorkel and scuba dive ) on my first snorkel outingbandos really needs to do something about this if they want the fish to remain .at my first encounter with them , i was a little put out that you are made to pay for a \" orientation dive \" or as all other divers call them , a refresher dive . </DOC> we loved the island , the beauty of the beach and were very happy with our standard room , which felt huge after a week on a liveaboard .the staff apart from the dive shop people were lovely and the food was fine , but expensive as to be expected .the atmosphere on the dive boat was miserable , the guides made no effort to mix and after the first dive we were given one tiny bottle of water and a small orange each .the staff were always friendly , polite and professional , nothing was ever to much trouble andthis was the only down side of the trip in that the extras were extremely expensive-",
