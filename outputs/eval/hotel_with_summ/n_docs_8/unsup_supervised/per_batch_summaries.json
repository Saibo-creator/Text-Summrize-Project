        "docs": "Old hotel that, depending on your point of view, is either charming or badly in need of an upgrade. Great location right on water front directly across from boat service. Front side rooms have a spectacular view of Lake Como. No wireless internet, decent breakfast. Our room was by the elevator so we could hear the elevator and hall conversations at all hours. We would recommend requesting a room away from the elevators. The most disturbing problem was the offensive, septic sewer smell coming from the bathroom. At the front desk, we were told this is problem common to all Bellagio hotels - we do not know if that is true. </DOC> This hotel occupies a premier location across from Lake Como in Bellagio. The view of the lake and mountain from our room was spectacular. Our first night there was a rain storm that blew water into the room through a closed balcony door (apparently, the shutters should have been closed but no one mentioned it). The bed was okay, but the bath was a tub hand-held shower which sprays all over the place if you're 6 feet with a bad back and can't get down into the air tub. The hotel really needs updating. Breakfast was okay, but had limited selection. </DOC> While walking around Bellagio we stopped by Bar Florence at The Hotel Florence to relax and have a drink. The bar has outdoor seating that overlooks the lake. It\u2019s a great spot to sit and people watch. Service was quick and prices were reasonable. </DOC> We had read positive reviews of this hotel on Tripadvisor. The room was clean and well-appointed, but the lobby looked a little shabby. We agree with another reviewer's comments about the unfriendly staff. We also thought it was overpriced for the accomodations. Would we stay here again? Yes, if there was not a better option. </DOC> This place is located right across a small street from the lake and offers wonderful views from the front rooms. In addition to the bar and restaurant on the ground floors, there is a really special spot they run on the waterfront in front of the hotel. Sheltered under some large trees, this place offers a special spot for a glass of champagne, lunch or dinner. Service is really top notch. </DOC> So easy to get to from the ferry-steps away. We had a great room with a view of the lake and all the ferries coming and going. The breakfast room here was very good-lots of variety. Just know that those eggs that look hard boiled are not-they have a cooker for them. We had a good chuckle with the woman in the breakfast room-usually there is a sign out about them. But it was a great way to start off the day! Lake Como is a stunningly beautiful place. </DOC> This is a Hotel that you remember. Location great, right on the water, 50 yards from Ferry dock. Front desk was friendly and helpful, ie. parking, sightseeing etc. My room was a side room with a view. It was very nicely decorated. The owner was friendly and welcoming. Breakfast was all you could eat with eggs and cooked bacon. I highly recommend this Hotel. </DOC> We stayed a week in Bellagio and enjoyed every day of it. Hotel Florence is well positioned on the front next to the Villa Serbelloni, service and food is good. We paid the extra and had a large room overlooking the Lake with two balconies from where we got a good view of the promenade and the coming and goings of the ferries. The Hotel faces west and gets the sun from late morning. Parking in Bellagio is very limited on the week-end but we managed to park alongside the Hotel for free within the white lines, meters apply from 0800 to 2000 on the blue lines.",
