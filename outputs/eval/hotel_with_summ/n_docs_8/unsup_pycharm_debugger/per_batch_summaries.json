        "docs": "We had a wonderful vacation at the Sands at Grace Bay! Our room was fantastic (ocean view two bedroom two bathroom #4201) and our view was excellent! The huge screened in balcony was amazing, we spent every evening out there! I seriously want to buy the unit and live there! The staff was very friendly and helpful from the front desk to housekeeping to the wait staff at Hemingway's! The guys giving out towels and the guys setting up chairs and umbrellas on the beach were all very friendly and helpful too! The pool area was very very nice, we loved the river connecting the pools! The hammocks were an awesome added bonus too! Everything about the Sands was excellent! We will definitely be returning there soon! </DOC> There are pros and cons to any property. The location of this one is excellent. Perfect walk or bike ride into the little shopping area. Grace Bay is a gorgeous beach! The part that this hotel is on....perfect! No fighting for chairs on the beach, you don't have to pay for your lounge chairs, the pools had lots of space and they were very nice. The lazy river was extremely lazy. Our condo/room was large. It has more than enough space for us. We asked for a higher floor and a view. We were on a lower floor with a limited view. Ask for a room closer to the beach, then you are near the restaurant too. Linens were worn in the room. Heminway's, the restaurant on the property was delicious! Check in was slow. Nothing is cheap on this island other than the beach! </DOC> Right on Grace Bay Beach. All suite resort. We upgraded from studio garden view to One bedroom ocean view. Worth it though ocean view was a limited. Very clean, staff friendly. Beach breathless, great sunset views. Convenience store on premises super expensive. But you\u2019ll find prices on TCI exorbitant. Screened in porch makes for great evenings outside no flying insects. Having washer and dryer in room priceless. Daily housekeeping a plus!! Was there during spring break so lots of kids and noise\u2014 sure it\u2019s better other times of the year. Limited number of water sports equipment but you put your name on list and wait not too long. Pool heated and spotless. Only downside- outside bathrooms could be better maintained. </DOC> This was our 4th trip to the Turks and Caicos and our 3rd stay at the Sands. We honestly will not stay any other place. I am sure there are fancier and larger hotels, but you can't beat the friendly staff, the great accommodations, the delicious meals at Hemingway's, or that beautiful beach that the Sands has to offer. Every year we talk about going back on the plane ride back home. Thank you Sands at Grace Bay for always making our vacation a wonderful experience. </DOC> I stayed at Sands one night. Grace bay beach is beautiful and hotel provides chairs and towels. Rooms are ok, a bit dated. My room lock malfunctioned and had to be replaced. staff is friendly. Wifi signal is weak to point of being almost nonexistent. Hemmingways restaurant is good but expensive. </DOC> Stayed 2 nights at Sands at Grace Bay. Great location, within walking distance to amazing shopping and some restaurants. Hemingways Restaurant is located within the restaurant. Great sand beach with free use of kayaks, sailing cats, paddle boards. They have a small mini mart also located on property. The room was very nice with kitchenette with mini ref, sink and microwave oven and couch & chair sitting area. The best surprise of all was......in suite laundry!!!! Don't miss the island fish fry at Bight Beach on Thursday night! </DOC> My husband and I went to the Sands without kids for a week of relaxing and peace and quiet. The resort was the perfect destination for us. The grounds are beautiful and the beach is spectacular. There is plenty to do on the beach - kayaks, sailboats, paddleboards, floats - lots of quiet spots by the pools, great food at Hemingway's, nice spa services, and general feeling of unpretentiousness that suits us perfectly. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Can't wait to return! </DOC> The Sands at Grace Bay is one of the few affordable places to stay directly on Grace Bay Beach. The rooms are updated and clean, the pool is beautiful, the restaurant on property, Hemingway\u2019s, is excellent, and the location is excellent! This was our third time staying here and we will definitely stay here again!",
