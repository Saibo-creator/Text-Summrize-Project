Cool place to stay in Oman. Nice infrastructure. </DOC> Spending 3 nights with my spouse for celebrating our anniversary, we stay at the Cliff Pool Villa.. The view is so magnificent, the staffs are helpful and we were having great experience here.. The Villa itself are spacious with very authentic local art, I feels home... we spend our time her by those activities : 1. Enjoy my spa experience here, with nice bed treatment and My professional masseur: Lee Ann 2. At recreation centre, Hussein suggest us to join several activities and he explained very details. We decided to join the 2 village trekking, and Abdellah as the mountain guru helped us to enjoy the experience 3. A tasty culinary at Bella Vista and the Al Qalla 4. Enjoy sunset at Diana's point terrace Definitely its a very great place to stay </DOC> The location of the hotel was picked around a famous spot called Diana's Point where the princess and her husband came in the 90's by a chopper and camped for a day. The architectural design is interesting and does take into it a lot of influence from the local architecture. There several varieties in room sizes and the place does have a majistical feeling. The staff are very hospitable , we were taken in a tour by Rose who we met at the entrance and she was very generous with explaining the various parts of the hotel. </DOC> We had a great time and an extremely relaxing stay. The view from the room and the sun deck is indescribable and no picture can show the real life experience. We spent a whole day just in our room watching the view and bathing in our room pool! </DOC> We were only able to stay for one night unfortunately, but it was worth it. Would love to go back sometime. Canyon View room - one of the best hotel rooms I have stayed in and the view is indeed stunning. Superb service, as you would expect. Lovely pool. We ate in the Moroccan restaurant, very good. Hopefully will return soon. </DOC> This is a top review and well deserved. First of all the location is amazing. At 2000 my above sea level on the Omani mountains with thin and fresh air, we really enjoyed it. The resort is spectacular. We had a villa with Mountain View and it is amazing. You wake up in the morning with view of the canyon. The staff is super friendly. We enjoyed a lot the food. We went climbing with the guides and it was really good. The resort has also a very good CENTRE for kids of all ages. We will definitely come back. Thanks a lot for the fantastic hospitality. </DOC> This hotel was really excellent. Never cheap at Anantara but an amazing location with superb balcony views over the valleys. We used the Spa and pool facilities and were not disappointed. You can explore local villages yourself nearby or take guided tours. We went on an amazing wadi walk fo over 4 hours, not for those afraid of heights, as we scaled rocky escarpments and swam in idyllic freshwater pools. This was a great relaxing getaway with a welcome happy hour and lovely international buffet, Italian and Arabic restaurants. Difficult to beat. </DOC> We spent four nights in this hotel over New Year\u2019s Eve. It was an absolutely amazing experience.the location of the hotel is out right spectacular on the cliffs at 2000 m height. We had booked a pool villa and had an amazing view over our infinity pool into the distance. This selection of restaurants is gorgeous and we absolutely love the level of attendance of all staff to any request. A complete 5 star experience",
