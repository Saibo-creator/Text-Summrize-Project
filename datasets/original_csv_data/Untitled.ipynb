We were given a very warm greeting by staff and all through our stay the staff did all they could to make sure we were looked after. The room itself was very well laid out and had a very comfortable bed and a lovely bathroom. The whole building is recently built so most things are in very good condition. We had a problem with the hotel safe when we arrived and that was fixed by a nice chatty handyman who also gave us ideas of restaurants and places to visit while in Whitby. The next issue was that the room was strangely very warm. (It wasnt a hot day either - about 17 degrees). We asked to have some lighter bed linen and this was organised very efficiently while we were out at dinner. When we got back from dinner, we wanted a bath - but the hot water was too cold for a bath. Apparently there is some kind of heat sump they use - but it wasn't very effective - so the handyman came back and turned on the gas hot water - so in about an hours time I went out again to the reception to ask and found this had been turned on and the water was hot. The room had no opening windows - only a sliding door out onto a balcony. The balcony was shared by all of the other rooms so there wasn't any privacy or security if we left the sliding door open. There was no airconditioning in the room either althought I understand they are planning to install this soon. However, during the night the room was so hot we had to open the outside door. The next morning, we reported the problems with the overheated room and the staff undertook to bring us a fan for the next night. The only problems were that it was impossible to sleep with the noise of the fan - plus we had to open the sliding door to let the hot air out of the room...so it wasn't really a solution. One other thing - from reading the website it wasn't clear that the swimming pool was a distance away from where we were staying. The staff are very happy to give you a ride along the road in a golf cart - but it put me off having a swim. The breakfasts were really great and the waiting staff were genuinely friendly and helpful. I am guessing that once the airconditioning issues are fixed it will be a lot easier to sleep in the room and it will make the Raithwaite a very good hotel.

I got myself a nice corner room, with a window that could be put ajar, a comfortable bed, and a surprisingly large bathroom. There's a small table where two people can get together (although it is unlikely that somebody would bring his/her spouse to a Telford trade fair), and a comfortable king size bed. Breakfast is not the usual full english, but what I would call an augmented continental. I did not ask for more, as you get enough stuffed with food during these trade shows. I must say that I liked the bacon (I am very difficult with bacon, so that's a compliment), and also appreciated the possibility to take away a cup of coffee. The breakfast lady was charming and efficient. There's also a bar, which I did use, but the bar at the Holiday Inn next door seems to attract all the audience. That brings us to the competition. For some pound sterling more, there's the Holiday Inn, featuring the full english breakfast and a fun bar. Mind you, you can benefit of these extras and still stay at the Telford International, paying some extra pounds.

It is set in an old part of town around the Wenshou Temple which has not been turned into a touristy shopping street like the area around the Wuhou temple. This area is largely visited by Chinese tourists but not huge crowds or tour groups so although there are some shops they are very low key and very local. There is a street with colourful Tibetan ladies selling jewellery off stalls. The hotel is set in a beautiful old house, which has been renovated but not spoilt. Initially we stayed in a suite so that we could get over the long flight, and after that we had a standard room for our other two visits. Everything was provided in the rooms, (though a few more hooks on the wall would be nice!) Both rooms were very cosy and comfortable - the huge suite was above the inner courtyard, whereas the standard room had a balcony overlooking the old street. We were plenty warm enough using the air con unit, and the quilt on the bed kept us warm at night. Most nights we ate at the vegetarian restaurant in the Wenshou temple - go to the one on the first floor (2 in Chinese terms) rather than the buffet on the ground floor which is a bit baffling. The upstairs one has delicious food and delightful staff. Beware the very spicy dishes - they are full of really hot chillies. We are used to spicy food and love it, but one of the dishes had so many chillies in we had to leave it! There is a metro stop about 5 minutes walk away, and a handy small supermarket just round the corner. We spent a lot of time just exploring the local area, with all the teahouses, the bakeries, the wonderful buildings and the friendly and fascinating temple life. My only criticism of the hotel is that we found the breakfast to be very poor, and this put us off eating in the hotel restaurant at night. Some of the staff speak very little English, but they put us in touch with a local guy who arranged our volunteering at the Panda Conservation Centre, but also gave us a huge number of tips and advice about Chengdu. Ask for Sam - he speaks wonderful English and is a great guy. The staff try hard and are as helpful as they can be without a great understanding of English. We visited a lot of places in Chengdu, and this was definitely our favourite location.

I admit that I did look elsewhere when I learned that I would be staying in a student dormitory, but june being high season in Edinburgh, I soon gave up and prepared myself mentally for the worst. Upon arrival, my worries were quickly dissolved. While being basic, the room was quite well appointed, with storage space, a comfortable twin bed, a coffee tray, TV, complimentary internet and a window that could actually be opened. The bathroom was certainly small, but functional, and in fact just as good as those I have seen in many 3 star hotels. Being in a student residence, there are additional advantages: There are a several pantries, each assigned to a limited number of rooms, which are excellent rooms hang around or have a snack. The large windows and nice views make these pantries very welcoming. On the campus is a restaurant, serving breakfast, lunch and dinner. Breakfast was included in my rate and was of the “full Scottish” type – so delicious that even my wife abandoned her usual bread and jelly diet in favor of poached eggs, ham and cheese (I never saw her do that in a 5 star hotel, which is quite a feat). On one evening, I tried dinner, which was also quite good. There also is a bar, which closes at 9:30 – makes sense, after all, we’re on a university campus! The only gripe I have with the restaurant is that it’s quite noisy. The crowd is quite interesting – students, conference attendees, and a few budget travelers. A word on the location: the campus is not located in the city center, but a 30 minute walk south. For those who wish not to walk, there’s bus line 14 going right to the city center. Getting from the airport to the hotel requires first a 30 minute ride on the Airlink 100 (buy tickets in advance on the internet) bus, and then either a short cab ride or bus line 14. The campus is quite close to Arthur’s seat, a prominent mountain peak (actually a former volcano). On one afternoon I climbed up and quite enjoyed it.

We arrived early, so we took advantage of a lovely pizza while sitting on the outdoor terrace overlooking the lake. There is a nearby pergola which would be lovely for outdoor dining. The food was disappointing for dinner. I suspect that most people take the advantage of a taxi ride into downtown Bellagio, where there are countless competing restaurants. We chose to avoid the ride and had dinner at the hotel. Only a few tables were occupied. The food was OK, but not up to what we would expect of Bellagio standards. The breakfast was marginal compared to the other 3-star Italian hotels in which we stayed. It was OK, but certainly not much more than a continental breakfast.

There is one issue which is not unique to the Hotel Beausite and we found in a few other European hotels - which would not be tolerated in a US hotel: the fire escapes. The fire escape for our floor is via the balcony inside our room (Room 27). In order to use the fire escape, one would have to wake us up so we could unlock our door, and then trapse through our room to the balcony (there is a red box on the wall outside our room with glass covering what I am guessing is a key to our room, but, in the event of a fire, no one would probably be thinking about how to break the glass to get the key!). Once on our balcony, there is a railing about 3' high, and on the other side of the railing - a foot or so away - is what looks like an extension ladder (just rungs - no steps) that is vertical - so to exit the room, you'd have to climb over the balcony railing and then reach out with one foot to get to the vertical ladder, and then descend the ladder straight down. I'm 75 years old, and in pretty good shape, but I can image easily slipping off this ladder in trying to reach it from the balcony - or trying to descend the ladder. Think about inclement weather! Let's hope that there never is a fire in the Beausite, but I can imagine some real problems and potential injuries if one were to occur and the guests had to evacuate.\", timeStruct='2018-10-01 00:00:00', timeUnix='1538344800', service='4.0', cleanliness='5.0', rooms='-1.0', value='-1.0', location='4.0', bin_service='0.0', bin_cleanliness='1.0', bin_rooms='-1.0', bin_value='-1.0', bin_location='0.0', bin_rating='0.0', text_filtered_per_sentence='\"[\\'the hotel is clean and very pleasant .\\', \\'included breakfasts were very good and overall , service in the hotel was very good .\\', \\'the dining room offerings are limited , so we would recommend restaurants nearby ( within a few minutes walk )\\', \\'that are excellent and a good value .\\', \\'there is one issue which is not unique to the hotel beausite\\', \"\"once on our balcony ', aspect_filtered_per_sentence=\" there is a railing about 3 ' high \", text_filtered_per_relation=' and on the other side of the railing - a foot\"\"', aspect_filtered_per_relation=' \\'or so away - is what looks like an extension ladder ( just rungs - no steps )\\']\"', rel_filtered_per_relation='[1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]', set_kw=\"['the hotel very pleasant', 'the hotel clean and very pleasant', 'breakfasts overall', 'breakfasts very good and overall', ', service in the hotel was very good', 'service in the hotel', 'the dining room offerings limited']\", id='[1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3]'),\n",

While many other reviewers have already covered many of the aspects of the facility, I’ll try and cover a few other aspects. I booked my room directly with the Riad and would advise others to do likewise. The management of the Riad arranged our airport transfers which really reduced our stress on arrival. Upon reaching the gate into the city walls, we were met by an employee who escorted us into the labyrinthine streets and alley ways that are an inherent part of Marrakech’s charm. The Riad is a multi-level structure surrounding two courtyards. A terrace on top gives views out over the city to the Atlas Mountains in the distance. Everything within the Riad is spic and span with a calm decorating scheme throughout. While it was a little cool for me to take a dip, there are two plunge pools for your use. At the Riad, I took advantage of the opportunity for a massage and was impressed by the quality of the masseuse. To help guests who are wandering around the city, every guest is provided with a cell phone with a list of support numbers and a promise to come retrieve you if you’re lost. We never had to “phone a friend” as we considered it part of the adventure to navigate our way out and back through the mazes and rabbit warrens In the city. However, in one especially telling incident - as we ambled down a street near the markets - one of the uniformed young men staffing the hotel, who was going out to assist another guest, recognized us and immediately stopped and offered his assistance unbidden and ensured we were OK before proceeding on. Breakfasts were bountiful and a real effort was given to ensuring a variety over our stay.
